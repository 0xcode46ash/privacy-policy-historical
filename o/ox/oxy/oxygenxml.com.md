We may collect information about your interaction with Syncro Soft sites and products. For example, we may use site analysis tools to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine and keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you perform on our sites and products. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring Web site addresses.
