# Privacy Policy | The Oxford Club

The Oxford Club takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that The Oxford Club takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our websites.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by an Internet server when you visit a website. Some cookies can be used to identify your computer each time you visit a site.

The Oxford Club website uses cookies only to allow authentication for access to the Subscriber Only areas of our sites.

In other words, you can leave the site and come back without having to re-enter your user name and password every time (within a set time period). We do not use cookies to track your browsing habits or collect any information about you.

**Submitting Data**

At no time are you required to submit personal information to access any area of The Oxford Club site. Visitors to our other sites are asked to submit a login name and password to visit Subscriber Only sections of the sites. This is to ensure you can receive the services you are paying for.

**Ordering Online**

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer – an encryption protocol – and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

The Oxford Club does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of The Oxford Club ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Oxford Club products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please [click here](http://oxfordclub.com/Visitors/ContactUs.html) to contact our customer service department.

**Email**

If you subscribe to The Oxford Club, your name and email address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of The Oxford Club have access to this data. We do not give Oxford Club addresses to outside companies.

Any email you send to The Oxford Club is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our email list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.

**Unsolicited Email Messages**
