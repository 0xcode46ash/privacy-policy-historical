The OUP Group is committed to protecting your privacy online. This privacy policy explains how we will do this. We will review this privacy policy in the light of comments we receive so please check the latest version. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us by emailing us at [Jnls.Cust.Serv@oup.com](mailto:Jnls.Cust.Serv@oup.com).

### **What kind of information do we collect and how do we use it?**

When you visit the Website, we may collect information and statistics that contain your identifying information. The information collected may include information relating to your behaviour and navigation on the Website including but not limited to, traffic data, location data, IP address, weblogs and other communication data and the resources that you access. We also keep details of your computer (e.g. information about your browser, computer (e.g. your operating system and settings). In addition, please note that we may combine all information (including anonymous information) which we collect about you (including those from other of our affiliates websites) so that we can better understand, and in turn, provide you and other customers with more customised and better information, products and services, viewing recommendations and advertising.

If you subscribe to or ask for further information about the Website, we ask for your name, email address, postal address, and other relevant personal information. Personal information submitted in this way is added to our access control database, hosted by a third party hosting company, and to our customer databases at our and/or our affiliates' premises. This information will be updated if you inform us of any changes.

If you are a subscriber (which may be you as an individual or an institution to which you are affiliated) (including a subscriber on a trial basis), your personal information will be used to enable us to verify that you are a subscriber and to deliver any restricted content on the Website to you.

If you sign up to receive newsletters and promotional offers, we will ask you for your email address and your name and this information will be added to our customer databases.

We may use information in our customer databases to send you information about us, our affiliates, our products and services, and our affiliates' products and services that we think may be of interest to you electronically or otherwise.

We may contact you by email to request that you provide feedback by completing surveys  on your user experience of the Website and its content. Completion of these surveys is not compulsory. Any feedback will be used for internal OUP Group purposes only and will not be shared with third parties other than those affiliates, licensors and suppliers, which assist us in making the Website available to you. 

We request personal information (such as your name, email address and other contact details) from you when you contact us with subscription management queries, technical problems, to comment on the Website, or when you ask for information about how to use the products and/or services made available on the Website. Personal information submitted by you via the "contact us" page will not be added to our customer databases and we request it simply so that we can respond to you about your query. Statistics regarding the types of queries submitted to us via the "contact us" page may be collated by us in aggregate form so that we can effectively monitor the Website and improve levels of service.

If you have asked for information or subscribed to restricted content on the Website in the past and no longer subscribe to such service and do not wish us to store information about you, please contact us and we will remove your details from our customer databases. We need to store information about current subscribers in order to fulfil our contractual requirements to you and grant you access to restricted content on the Website.
