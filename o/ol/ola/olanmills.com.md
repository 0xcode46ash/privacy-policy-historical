For each visitor to our web page, our web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name and e-mail address (where possible).

We collect e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual consumer, used to notify consumers about updates to our web site, used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes and not shared with other organizations or commercial purposes.

When you access and interact with one of our websites, we may collect certain information often referred to as "clickstream data." Such data may include the type of Internet browser and operating system you are using, the pages and information you accessed on our site, the total time spent on our site, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site. Also, where you have previously identified yourself in the registration process as affiliated with a particular business or organization, we may record the fact that a representative of your business or organization visited the site, along with other clickstream data concerning that visit. Clickstream data will not be used to identify you personally and will not be associated or correlated with any site visitor in a personally-identifiable manner.

When you view one of our websites, we may store certain information on your computer. This information may be in the form of a small text file called a "cookie" and can help us improve your experience with our websites in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences. Notably, our websites use cookies to help understand which parts of our websites are most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus.

Also, where specific programs associated with our websites require a user ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID and password so that you will not have to re-enter that information the next time you access the website. This function is accomplished by the placement of a cookie. 

With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please be aware, however, that some features and programs of our websites may be unavailable to you if cookies are erased or blocked. 

Some uses of cookies in connection with our websites may be under the control of unaffiliated entities that we retain for the management of certain programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/customer requests. Olan Mills requires these entities to confine their use of cookies to the uses permitted by this Policy, but we cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies.

If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

Olan Mills takes seriously its obligations under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act concerning the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to submit personal information to our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure that we obtain parental consent to such submission.

We encourage all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of the Internet.
