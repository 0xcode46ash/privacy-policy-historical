You have come to the right page if you want to know more about Olympus Europe's Data Privacy Policy. Olympus is a privacy conscious global organisation and is strongly committed to your personal right to privacy. Find out how we from Olympus in Europe protect your personal online privacy according to the European and international data protection legislation.

Generally, a visitor need not register or give any personal identification to use this site. No software or hardware techniques are employed to capture a visitor's e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.

We only collect identifiable personal information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by a user to us. A visitor may choose to become a user and provide information to register for ordering goods or services, being informed, or to apply for a job, for example. When a user provides this type of identifiable information to us, we use it solely for the purposes for which it was provided and secure your information as required by German Law. The user may at any time revoke his consent to the processing of personal data; Olympus will take all necessary measures to ensure that such a request is immediately carried out. Should you have questions or concerns however, feel free to direct these to our Data Privacy Officer at [DataPrivacy@Olympus-Europa.com](mailto:DataPrivacy@Olympus-Europa.com).

Here are our core principles on Personal Data Privacy which apply for Olympus Europe internet activities: 

**Communication and Tracking (Cookies)** For better communication via the Internet Olympus sometimes uses small text files (cookies) remembered by your browser according to its settings, so that you can navigate through our Web site easier. We also use this technique where appropriate, to keep track of page views and to personalise your communication with Olympus. For the evaluation of the success of our marketing campaigns, we occasionally employ cookies and other technologies. Within this evaluation we only analyse quantitative data, which allows us to render more attractive services to you. This data, raised to the improvement of our website, is aggregated to anonymous statistics, which do not enable us to track individual usage of our sites. Personalized data will only be used by us with your consent. We implement some of these cookies through our server technology on your storage device. The use of cookies is now standard procedure for most Web sites, however if you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, change your browser settings to opt-out of receiving cookies. This however, may limit your ability to interact with Olympus Web sites.
