> For the most part, whenever you visit OLYMPUS.COM, we gather general, statistical information about your visit—what site you are coming from, what pages or areas you visit on our site, and how long you stay at a particular location on the site. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (like email addresses) when you simply browse our site. What general information we do collect is only used in the aggregate—much like television ratings, this information tells us how popular different areas of our site are and helps us to improve our site.

We may also ask you for information about your interests, opinions and background (so that we can better interact with you in the future and better understand your needs as a customer).
