Wewon't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifyinginformation.

**Information we collect**

The information we gather on our site falls into two categories:

  * Anonymous tracking information we collect as you navigate through our site.



Additionally, third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website-- such as vendors of products and services offered through our site -- maygather the same kinds of information.

Weshare with these third parties such information as is necessary to provide theproducts or services. We will not provide your email address to such thirdparties unless it's necessary to provide services you have requested, or toallow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion.

In both cases, we aggregatethis information and use it to gain a better understanding of our users'interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. We also share this aggregateinformation with advertisers, to help them gain a better understanding of thedemographics of our audience.
