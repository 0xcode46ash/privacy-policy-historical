**USA Patriot Act**  
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA Patriot Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person (including business entities) who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, physical address, date of birth, tax payer identification number and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying docuements. We will let you know if additional information is required.

**Protecting what’s yours.**  
Personal. Confidential. Private. You share information about yourself in the highest expectation that every fact and figure will remain safe, secure, in your control—and well you should. You own your information as surely as you own a home, a car or the money in your bank account. Be assured Old National regards it exactly the same way.

Because you’ve trusted us to help you reach life’s goals, we want you to be an informed partner. We want you to know in detail our daily practices for protecting what’s yours.
