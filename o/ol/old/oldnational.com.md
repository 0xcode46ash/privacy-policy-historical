# Privacy Policy

|  | 

**Recognition of a Customer's Expectation of Privacy**  

You regard your personal information as yours, and so do we.  
Because we do not sell or share your information with third parties not associated with services or activities of Old National (except as allowed by law), there is no need for you to tell us not to share your private information.

**Collection, Retention, and Use of Customer Information**   
We collect and use various types of information to service your accounts, save you time and money, and better understand your needs. We do so in order to help you learn more about the products and services that may be of interest to you.

We collect nonpublic personal information about you  
from the following sources:

• Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;  
• Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; and  
• Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.

**Security Standards**  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards  
to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your information.  
Old National also limits access to your nonpublic personal  
information to those employees who need to know that  
information in order to provide products and services to you.  
All our employees are trained to understand and comply  
with these information principles.

**Maintenance of Accurate Information**  
Old National has implemented internal controls and procedures designed to maintain accurate records concerning your personal  
information. Should you ever believe that our records contain  
inaccurate, incomplete or noncurrent information about you,  
please notify us. We will respond to requests to correct  
the information in a timely manner.

**Disclosure of Information to Nonaffiliated Third Parties**  
We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about  
our customers or former customers to nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law or as described below. 

_**Service Providers and Joint Marketing Agreements**_  
We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described  
under the heading “Collection, Retention, and Use of Customer  
Information,” to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

**_Beneficiaries of Trusts_**  
Certain information, such as fiduciary information, is subject  
to more restrictive information sharing limitations than other types of information, both internally and externally. If you have questions regarding fiduciary information, please contact your Trust Relationship Manager.

_**Sharing as Required by Law**_  
We may disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties as  
allowed by law. For example, this may include a disclosure  
in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud  
investigation, recording of deeds or trust and mortgages in public records, an audit or examination, or the sale of your account to another financial institution. We may also share information:

• If you initiate a request for us to share information with an outside party; or  
• If the information is provided to help complete a customer-initiated transaction. 

**Sharing Information within Old National**   
As permitted by law, we may share information about our  
experiences or transactions with you or your account, such as  
account balance, payment history and services purchased,  
among our Old National family of companies. The Old National  
family of companies consists of financial service providers,  
and the number of companies may change from time to time.  
There are no nonfinancial companies, or other organizations  
within the Old National family of companies, with whom we  
share information.

For example, we may share information in order to:

• Provide customer service or account maintenance; or  
• Tell you about other products or services offered by Old National that we believe you will find useful.

We do not share among our affiliates other information  
you have given us in connection with an application for one of  
our products or services, or information we have received from  
a consumer reporting agency or other third party. You will be  
notified if we intend to do so and be given the opportunity to  
prevent such sharing.

**Protecting what’s yours.**

Personal. Confidential. Private. You share information about yourself in the highest expectation that every fact and figure will remain safe, secure, in your control—and well you should. You own your information as surely as  
you own a home, a car or the money in your bank account.

Be assured Old National regards it exactly the same way.

Because you’ve trusted us to help you reach  
life’s goals, we want you to be an informed partner.  
We want you to know in detail our daily practices  
for protecting what’s yours.

What does this Privacy Policy cover?

Our concern for safekeeping your personal information goes far beyond this brochure. Our Privacy Policy covers the practices of all affiliates within the Old National family*—including our banking, insurance, investment and financial planning, asset management, and trust service companies. It applies to the nonpublic personal information of our customers and former customers. This Privacy Policy also serves as our Policy notice.

**Keeping Up To Date with Our Privacy Policy**  
We will provide notice of our Privacy Policy annually, as long as you maintain an ongoing relationship with us. You may view our policy and a listing of our family of companies on our Web site at [www.oldnational.com](http://www.oldnational.com/) or contact us for another copy.
