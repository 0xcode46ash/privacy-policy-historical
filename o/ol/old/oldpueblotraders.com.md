**1** **. What is your Privacy Policy?**  
You can shop at our website with the same confidence you shop from our catalogs, knowing that we are fully committed to protecting your privacy. We are so serious about this issue, every Old Pueblo Traders® employee, agent and contractor is bound to follow and enforce the privacy guidelines we outline here. 

In this policy statement we will explain what information we collect from you, as well as how and why we collect it, and how we may use it. If you have a question about any part of this policy, e-mail us at [privacyandsecurity@oldpueblotraders.com](mailto:privacyandsecurity@oldpueblotraders.com), telephone toll-free 1-800-362-8410; or write to Old Pueblo Traders®, Dept. ML, P.O. Box 27800, Tucson, Arizona 85726-7800. Please include your name, address, and customer number (if you have one) when you [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20020423001311id_/http%3A//www.oldpueblotraders.com/pagebuilder/Contact). 

**2** **. What information do you collect when I visit your website?**  
We gather data about your web browser and the pages you choose to visit. This information is used as a part of our ongoing efforts to improve your shopping experience. We do not collect or store any personal information during this process. 

When you place an order, we ask for your name, address, customer number (if you have one), credit card number, and expiration date to bill and ship your merchandise to you. In addition, we request your telephone number and e-mail address so that we can follow up with you if we have a question about your order. 

**3** **. Will you send me promotions by e-mail?**  
During the process of ordering from us we ask you if you would like to be included in our e-mail promotions. You may decline these promotions by clicking the 'No' button when asked if you would like to receive e-mail promotions. 

**4** **. Do you share my information with others?**  
We may share your e-mail address, name, and postal address with the other catalogs in our family of fine catalogs. If you would rather not receive these special offers and catalogs, e-mail us at [emaillist@oldpueblotraders.com](mailto:emaillist@oldpueblotraders.com) (please type "do not share with affiliated catalogs" in the body of the message), or send us a letter stating this preference. The letter may be sent to Old Pueblo Traders®, Dept. ML, P.O. Box 27800, Tucson, Arizona 85726-7800. 

We make a very limited amount of the information collected on-line (names and postal addresses only-no other information collected on-line is ever shared without your permission) available to companies or organizations whose offers may interest you. If you would rather not receive these, e-mail us at emaillist@oldpueblotraders.com (please type "do not share" in the body of the message), or send us a letter stating this preference. The letter may be sent to Old Pueblo Traders®, Dept. ML, P.O. Box 27800, Tucson, Arizona 85726-7800. 

We may provide links to other sites and services not our own. While we choose these associations carefully, we cannot claim responsibility or liability for their privacy and security policies. Be assured we will not share your e-mail address with them without your permission. 

**5** **. What is your position as to children's privacy?**  
Children's privacy is of special concern to us all. Therefore, we voluntarily comply with the Children's On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1990 and the US Federal Trade Commission's Children's On-line Privacy Protection Rule (16 C.F.R. Part 312). We neither collect nor maintain information at our site from anyone we know is under the age of 13, nor is any part of our site directed to anyone under the age of 13. 

**6** **. What is your security policy?**  
Because we all benefit from secure on-line shopping, we have taken steps to build and manage a system that you can use with confidence. Our goal is to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, while maintaining the accuracy and appropriate use of the information we do store. 

**7** **. Do you use a firewall?**  
Your private account information is preserved behind a "firewall" instead of being directly connected to the internet. Observing this industry standard ensures that your information is not available to unauthorized computers. 

**8** **. Do you use encryption and what is it?**  
Yes, we do use encryption when your information is sent from your computer to ours. Encryption, either by Secure Sockets Layer or Secure Hypertext Transmission Protocol, scrambles the information you send such that it cannot be read by any computer other than ours. In the unlikely event that it is intercepted along its way, thieves need the "key" we store in our computer (behind the firewall) to unscramble your information. An unbroken key or closed lock symbol on your browser's navigation bar confirms that the information has been sent safely. 

**9** **. Do you use cookies and what are they?**  
Yes, we do use cookies. A "cookie" is a bit of data that our computer sends to your browser, to assist us as we take your order. These cookies are sent to your computer once you decide to order from us. After you have completed the ordering process and sent the order to us, we erase the cookie. 

**10** **. What do I do if I have reservations about ordering electronically?**  
If you still have reservations about ordering electronically, our friendly Customer Service Representatives are standing by 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to take your order. To call us, please follow the instructions contained within our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20020423001311id_/http%3A//www.oldpueblotraders.com/pagebuilder/Contact) document.
