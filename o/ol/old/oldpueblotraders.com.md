**Q:** | **What is your Privacy Policy?**  
A: | This privacy policy will tell you what personally identifiable information and personal information we may collect from our customers, how we may share this information, and how you can limit our sharing of your information. "Personally identifiable information" and "personal information" mean any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, telephone number, etc. 

Charming Shoppes, Inc. and Crosstown Traders, Inc. are members of the Direct Marketing Association. As a part of our commitment to your privacy, we support and adhere to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's "[Privacy Promise to American Consumers](http://www.the-dma.org/privacy/privacypromise.shtml)." Accordingly, we have agreed to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information exchanges with other marketers; (2) honor customer requests not to have their information transferred to others for marketing purposes; and (3) accept and honor customer requests to not receive solicitations from any of our brands.   
  
**Q:** | **What information do you collect when I visit your website?**  
A: | Generally, our customers can visit our web site without providing or revealing any personal or personally identifiable information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever visitors interact with our web site. We may track the internet domain address from which our customers visit our web site and analyze this data for trends and statistics. Unless a visitor to our web site voluntarily provides personal information to us, each individual customer remains anonymous.

We receive and may store certain personal information that our customers enter when visiting our web sites or provide to us in other ways. For instance, we collect the information you provide to us when you place an order, register with us, send an e-mail or call us, enter a sweepstakes or contest, subscribe to a service, enroll in a club, request to receive a catalog, or participate in a promotion. This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, product purchases, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, and other similar personal or preference data that you provide to us. It may also include information you submit about other people such as the name and address of a gift recipient. Whether or not you provide such information to us is completely your own choice   
  
**Q:** | **What is your e-mail policy?**  
A: | We will not sell, rent, or trade your e-mail address with any unaffiliated third party. We believe that your e-mail address is personal and should be kept that way.

**Q:** | **How do you use my information?**  
A: | We use personal and/or personally identifiable information you provide for our internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products (including products of our affiliates), services and offers, and providing you with information from and about our catalogs and web site. From time to time, we may also work with other organizations whom we believe are trustworthy and offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such instances, we might share limited information (such as your name and postal address) that we have collected from you, including personally identifiable information, so that such organizations may contact you with offers that may interest you.

**Q:** | **Will your privacy and security policy ever change?**  
  
A: | From time to time, our privacy and security practices may change.
