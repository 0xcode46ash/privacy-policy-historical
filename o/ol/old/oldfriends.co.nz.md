**Use of your information**

**Email**  
It is the policy of Old Friends to send our members email from time to time. It is also our policy to immediately remove any member from our mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Old Friends may send a monthly newsletter to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/Help.aspx) with your questions or comments.

We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites. 

Trade Me mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave Old Friends. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft Active Server Pages), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on Old Friends. 

Old Friends also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit Old Friends each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on Trade Me and helps us identify users abusing the Old Friends service.

Users who login may have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used to track users who abuse the Old Friends system and will be only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in conjunction with an Internet Service Provider, to find the dial-in account of a user and, ultimately, further information to identify a user. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties. 

If you choose to post messages in our message boards or other message areas we will collect that information you provide to us. 

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
