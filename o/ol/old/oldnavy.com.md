# Customer Service - Customer Privacy Policy

   
What kind of information does Old Navy collect?  
We collect information -- such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number \-- that you provide to us when you place an order, and when you register with us or participate in a contest, promotion, or survey. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online and in our stores. We may acquire customer names and mailing addresses for select postal mailings from third parties.

How does Old Navy use my information?  
When you register with Old Navy -- online, over the phone, or at one of our retail stores -- or participate in a contest, promotion or survey you may choose whether or not to receive email messages from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. We will then use the information you give us to communicate with you about our products, services, contests, and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you email messages to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. In addition, we maintain a record of your product interests and purchases to help us improve our site design and your shopping experience. 

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online and in our stores, as well as information about your product interests and purchases. In addition, we also may combine information you provide with demographic information that is publicly available. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, and to communicate with you by email or postal mail about Old Navy products, services, contests, and promotions that may be of interest to you.

Does Old Navy share my information with third parties?   
We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information, to fulfill promotions, and to communicate with our customers. However, we do not authorize any of those third parties to use your information in any other way. 

In addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests, or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to fulfill contractual or promotional obligations and to identify future promotional opportunities. 

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with another company to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information in order to participate. That information may then be used by us and the other company to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. 

We may occasionally participate in scrip, loyalty, and other similar programs. Scrip programs allow you to instruct Old Navy and oldnavy.com to divert a percentage of the amount you spend at Old Navy and oldnavy.com to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Old Navy and oldnavy.com, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. 

If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty, or other similar program in which Old Navy is a participating vendor, the company administering the scrip, loyalty, or other similar program (collectively, the "scrip company") will or should ask for your consent to have Old Navy and oldnavy.com or our credit card processor(s) share with the scrip company information regarding your Old Navy and oldnavy.com purchases. This information will include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may include your name. We will provide this information to the scrip company only as you have authorized us to do so. The scrip company may also share this information with the organizations you have chosen to receive a percentage of or information regarding your Old Navy and oldnavy.com purchases. 

Many scrip companies have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them. 

We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your age, gender, and types of products purchased, with our business partners to fulfill our contractual obligations. 

Except as described above, we do not rent, sell, or share any information we collect to or with any unaffiliated third party.

How do I remove my information from email, phone, and postal mailing lists?  
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us about our products, services, contests, or promotions via email, postal mail, or phone, please let us know by calling us at 1-800-OLD-NAVY, Option 1, or by sending us an email message. Please be sure to include your email address, full name and password. 

Please note, however, that such requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective. In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing list, we will have to maintain your name in a "do not mail" file to ensure we honor your request. Please also note that when you make an online purchase from oldnavy.com, we will contact you via email to confirm your order. In addition, we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail, or email with other questions regarding your order. 

If prior to participating in a contest or promotion you opted not to receive information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information from or about Old Navy in connection with the contest or promotion you registered for or participated in. If you do not want to receive information about Old Navy or share your information with Old Navy and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions, you may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions.

What are cookies? How does Old Navy use cookies on its site? Why do we use cookies?  
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID, that is used to track the pages you’ve visited. We use cookies, but we do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. 

We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. They also allow us to recognize registered customers when they visit, and to provide those customers with their account information. If you register with oldnavy.com or order from our site, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our site and what you buy. If you have not registered with us or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions. 

Through our use of cookies, we track and maintain the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting oldnavy.com. Keeping track of where you came from can help us to improve our site design and to fulfill our contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order, which means you will be unable to make purchases from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, so you will be unable to access (or change or delete) your account information.

How does Old Navy make sure my order information is secure?  
Protecting your order information is our priority. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after you access our secure server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the site's address should change from "http" to "https." 

Some browser versions and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers. If this is the case for you, you’ll be unable to connect to the server, so you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-OLD-NAVY, Option 1. Our Customer Care representatives will be happy to assist you.
