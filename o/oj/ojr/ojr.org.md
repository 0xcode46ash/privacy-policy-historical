# OJR.org Privacy Policy

Online Journalism Review has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering practices.

We maintain and periodically review log files that automatically record the following information: the IP adddress (not the e-mail address) from which you are connecting to the OJR server; the time at which you requested a file; the name of the file or files you requested; the Internet address of the website from which you were "referred" (for example, the page you were looking at when you clicked on a link that brought you to the OJR.org website); any search terms or keywords that you may have used in the search engine which directed you to this site; and your Internet browser and platform (Internet Explorer, Win 98, etc).

We also collect data on any error messages you might receive, such as 404s or "file not found." We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, such as the country of origin of our visitors. While the pages you choose to browse are linked in our log files to your computer's IP, this information is not connected to your email address. None of the automatically collected data identifies you as a person.

This site contains links to other sites. OJR.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**Security**

OJR.org makes every effort to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Since we do not conduct commercial transactions or request credit cards numbers, we do not use a secure server.

**Contacting the Website**

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact:
