**Credit Card Account Information:**

AOA does not disclose credit card account information provided by its members and customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, AOA submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate clearinghouse.

**Cookies:**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive which allows organizations to collect non-PII about the user’s use of a site. Once the user closes the browser, most cookies simply terminate. If you log in to the members-only area of Osteopathic.org, a short string of code is sent to your computer’s memory. This “session-based” cookie lets us know you already entered your password as you go to different pages on the site. If you do not use the password-protected parts of the site, you may block this session cookie and still use the rest of Osteopathic.org with no problems. If you register for DO Jobs Online, or DOCME online, a cookie will be set to recognize your preferences when you return to the site. If you block this cookie, you can still use the site.

**Log Files:**

The AOA uses IP addresses (i.e., information that identifies the location of computers or networks on the Internet that are accessing this website) to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user’s movements through the site, and gather broad information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to PII.

From time-to-time you may see a survey on Osteopathic.org. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

If you choose to reject any portion of this policy and have your PII removed from AOA records, please notify the AOA at [info@osteopathic.org](mailto:info@osteopathic.org).

### AOA Physician Data Policy

The AOA has promoted osteopathic medicine for over a century. The AOA is the major source of information about osteopathic medicine and the important role of osteopathic physicians. Shortly after it was founded, the AOA conducted its first Census of the Osteopathic Medical Profession and published the results in its first Directory. The AOA has now organized its unique data resources into the AOA Masterfile, and will continue to use its data to promote this important profession. 

The AOA collects data on all osteopathic medical students and osteopathic physicians, including those who are not AOA members. Osteopathic physicians are physicians who have graduated from medical schools accredited by the AOA. Each physician’s record includes demographic information, osteopathic medical school, postgraduate information, and current practice information. Demographic information includes gender, date of birth, mailing address and other contact information. Current practice information includes type of practice, self-identified specialty, licensure, and AOA board certification. Physicians may also ask the AOA to verify certain types of non-osteopathic postgraduate medical education, which then becomes part of their physician record. 

The AOA obtains educational information only from primary sources. It obtains demographic information from osteopathic medical schools. The AOA also obtains address information from commercial sources and from other members of the osteopathic family, which includes osteopathic medical schools, state associations and specialty colleges.

The AOA also collects data on those who are not DOs but who are members of the AOA, such as auxiliary members and associate members. 

The AOA Masterfile documents trends in the osteopathic medical profession and the important role osteopathic physicians serve in health care. It benefits the practicing physician by providing an easy way for the public, hospitals and licensing boards to verify credentials. 

While data verification and authentication are the Masterfile’s primary purpose, the AOA shares limited information with other members of the osteopathic family, and licenses portions of its Masterfile to selected licensees. Both operate under carefully restricted information usage agreements. The AOA does not release home addresses to licensees when we have a business address. Licensees work with many health care related companies that offer a wide range of products and services for physicians and the larger medical community. They include:

  * Medical and professional journals 

  * Drug recall and safety information 

  * Continuing medical education programs

  * Physician credential verification services 

  * Drug samples and pharmaceutical information

  * Medical equipment and supplies 

  * Employment opportunities 

  * General practice-related commercial offers of interest to physicians as consumers 




**Security:**

The AOA takes every precaution to protect our information. We use SSL encryption to protect information online. We also do everything in our power to protect our database off-line. All information is restricted in our offices. Employees must use password-protected screens when they enter the database. The server we store personally identifiable information on is kept in a secure environment. We obtain educational information only from primary sources and the ability to change any information in the Masterfile is restricted to a small number of employees. 

Physicians may direct the AOA:

  * To exclude them from all of the following: 

    * The online AOA Directory (including the members-only section) 

    * JAOA mailings 

    * special publications 

  * Not to release contact information to affiliates or licensee

This option permits the AOA to contact the physician, but the AOA will not share any contact information with other members of the osteopathic family, or with its licensees, which is the basis for receiving most of their products and services, including journals, new product announcements, information about health hazards and information about drug recalls. 

  * Not to release physician-provided information 

This option means that the AOA will not release any physician-provided information to licensees or other osteopathic organizations. This non-release includes physician-provided information used to announce drug recalls and health hazards, information given to state licensing agencies and agencies verifying credentials such as hospitals and physician groups. These physicians will also be excluded from the AOA Directory and will not receive the JAOA or any AOA special publications. 




The AOA invites you to contact the Member Service Center, 1-800-621-1773, Extension 1, to change your contact status. These changes become effective immediately.
