Types of information collected by OSH  
OSH gathers only the customer information that we need to administer our business and provide customer service. 

There are two categories of information we collect about you when you visit our site. The first type of information is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number and email address. Currently, this type of information will come from our customer feedback page, Ask Orchard page or our Customer Satisfaction Score Form. This information will help us to better serve our customers or respond back when appropriate. Other examples of when we may collect personally identifiable information are if you subscribe to an email program, choose to provide us reference information to allow us to customize your experience, or when you enter a sweepstakes or one of our promotions. 

The second category is non-personally identifiable information. Data, such as, IP address, browser type, domain name and specific OSH pages through which you click, is gathered in order to gain a better understanding of site development needs. This data is collected automatically and utilized in aggregate to help us look for trends so that we may improve our web site. 

What does OSH do with this information?  
OSH does not rent, sell, or exchange personally identifiable information about its customers. The only parties who have access to such information are those businesses within the OSH family of business, including OSH parent company, Sears, Roebuck and Co. Third parties that need access to your information in order to provide operational or other support services to us must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with our policy. OSH may share information about your OSH Commercial credit account with credit bureaus. OSH may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law. OSH may also disclose customer information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. The only OSH associates with access to your information are those employees who need it to do their jobs. Our employees are educated about OSH policies and practices in regard to safeguarding customer information; preventing its unauthorized access, use or disclosure; and ensuring its proper handling. 

What type of information does OSH collect from children?  
OSH does not currently collect information specifically from children unless it comes via our email address. All submitted email is forwarded to appropriate departments for review and if necessary a response. Information that is collected in this or any other manner is not rented, sold or exchanged.
