Orchard Supply Hardware does not collect personally identifiable information about users’ online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

### How Do We Protect Personal Information?

We have established and implemented reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect.

#### Secure Shopping

When you use a debit, credit or prepaid card in one of our stores or on osh.com, your payment card information is collected, stored and transmitted in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 

When you place orders on osh.com, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of osh.com from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

#### Passwords

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Orchard Supply Hardware will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on osh.com.

#### Information about Children

We are committed to protecting children’s privacy and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
