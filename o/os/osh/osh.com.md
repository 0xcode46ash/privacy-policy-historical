#### Information Collected Online

_osh.com Collection_

When you visit osh.com, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information. If you are registered with osh.com, this technology can use your IP address to connect your online activity with your personal information. The information we collect includes the IP (Internet protocol) address of your computer or mobile device, and your domain name, page requests, keystrokes, browser type, operating system and time spent on osh.com. This information helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. This information also allows us to optimize your shopping experience by enabling features such as the addition of multiple items to your cart before checkout. This technology applies to Orchard Supply Hardware content presented on another website, for example, Orchard Supply Hardware Weekly Ad.

In order to provide the best online experience possible, we also use this information for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping on osh.com, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.

To learn more about managing cookies, go to the section of this Privacy Statement under "How Can You Change your Privacy Preferences?".

_Orchard Supply Hardware Guest Network_

In the future, we plan to implement a Guest Network in our stores to allow customers to access the Internet. When implemented, we will collect the IP address of your device and may use it to deliver advertising about goods and services available in our store to your device on log-in. Orchard Supply Hardware is not responsible or liable for the activities or privacy policies of sites that you visit while logged into the Guest Network, other than osh.com, as described in this Privacy Statement.

_Third-Party Cookies_

We partner with third-party vendors to deliver advertisements about our products and services when you visit other websites on the Internet. These vendors place third party cookies which help us provide you with advertisements that are customized to your particular product preferences and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

To opt out of third-party vendors' cookies, go to the section of this Privacy Statement under "How Can You Change your Privacy Preferences?".

#### Information from Other Sources

We may obtain your e-mail address from a third party if you have “opted in” to receive marketing communications from Orchard Supply Hardware. We may also obtain information from companies that can enhance information we have collected to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our visitors (for example, adding street address or e-mail address information). This may improve our ability to contact you and improve the relevancy of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you.

#### Public Forums

Any information you submit in a public forum (for example, a customer review, forum or social network) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You alone are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these public forums.

### How Do We Use Your Information?

We may use the information we collect from you in the following ways:

We have established and implemented reasonable physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect. 

#### Secure Shopping

When you place orders on osh.com, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of osh.com from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

#### Passwords

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. Orchard Supply Hardware will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or e-mail messages).

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Site.

#### Information about Children

We are committed to protecting children’s privacy and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### Orchard Supply Hardware, LLC

### Mobile App Privacy Statement

#### Effective on May 17, 2013

This statement (“Privacy Statement”) governs your use of the Orchard Supply Hardware (“OSH”) “Orchard” mobile application (“App”). The App allows you to receive information about, and special offers and rewards from, OSH. 

###  What information does the App obtain and how is it used?

####  _User Provided Information_

The App obtains the information you provide when you use certain functionality of the App. When you use the App, you may provide: (a) your name, address, email address, birthday, user name, password, demographic survey information and other information you choose to provide when you register for Club Orchard via the App; (b) transaction-related information, such as when you respond to any offers from us; (c) information you provide us when you contact us for help; (d) member ID, password and e-mail address when you sign in to Club Orchard via the App; and (e) any information you have chosen to share with the App (e.g., e mail address and gender) when you log in to Facebook via the App. We may also use the information you provided us to contact your from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions, or for our internal analytics purposes. 

####  _Automatically Collected Information_

In addition, the App may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique user ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and your time zone. We or our third-party contractors may use this information only as necessary to provide information and special offers to your mobile device. For example, we do not store the IP address of your mobile device.

###  Does the App collect precise real time location information of the device?

This application does collect precise information about the location of your device, using the “location services” function of your device, if you allow such use. For example, for iOS, the first time you attempt an activity that requires the App to know your location, you will receive a pop-up message asking for permission. For Android, when you download the App, you will see a list of permissions required to install the App (including location services) and you will have the option to accept and install the App, or not. If you permit use of location information, we use your location information to provide requested location services, such as store locations and our store check-in feature.

###  Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the App?

We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information: (a) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; (b) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud; (c) with our third party services providers who work on our behalf, for the purpose of providing such services, and for no other purpose; and (d) if some or all of OSH’s business or assets are sold or otherwise transferred, to the buyer or transferee.

####  _Automatic Data Collection and Advertising_

We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the App is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. OSH’s third party services provider uses some of the information collected by the App, including the unique user ID of your mobile device, operating system of your device, type of device, and device location to deliver the content provided by the App. 

###  What are my opt-out rights?

You can stop all collection of information by the App easily by uninstalling the App. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by going to the location services, under “settings,” on your mobile device and turning location services off. 

###  Managing Your Information

If you’d like us to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the App, please contact us at [Customer-Service@osh.com](mailto:Customer-Service@osh.com) and we will respond in a reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for certain functions of the App to operate, and we may be required to retain certain information by law.

### Children

We do not use the App to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us.

### Security

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

### Changes

This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Statement by posting the new Privacy Statement here [www.osh.com/eng/customerservice/Privacy.cfm](http://www.osh.com/eng/customerservice/Privacy.cfm) You are advised to consult this Privacy Statement regularly for any changes.

### Your Consent

By downloading the App, you are consenting to our processing of User Provided Information and Automatically Collected Information as set forth in this Privacy Statement now and as amended by us. 

### Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the App, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at [Customer-Service@osh.com](mailto:Customer-Service@osh.com).
