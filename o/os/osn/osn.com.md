We will not willfully disclose personal information about you to any third party other than to process your subscription order for our services without requesting your permission or unless we are under a legal obligation to do so. You also authorise us to disclose your personal information if we believe the disclosure is appropriate to instigate an investigation of improper or illegal conduct in connection with our web site such as fraud, misrepresentation, intellectual property infringement, or any other activity that may expose us to liability.

## 2\. Collating Data

Cookies help us recognise repeat users allowing communication of a personal welcome message and tailoring of content to match particular interests.

We also may use outside advertising companies to display advertisements on our web site, advertisements may also contain Cookies.
