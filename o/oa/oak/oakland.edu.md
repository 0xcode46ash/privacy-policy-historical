# Privacy Statement

  
**Oakland University Web Privacy Statement**   
At Oakland University, we strive to respect the privacy of our Web site visitors because your privacy is important to us. Using the Internet should be a fun experience, and we want to help you make it enjoyable. This privacy statement describes what information we collect and how that information is protected and used with those ideas in mind.

**Information Gathered**  
Web sites you visit may gather information about you. Sometimes you are asked to supply information such as your name, address or e-mail address. Other times processes built into the Web site gather information.

We may ask you for information to answer a request that you have submitted to Oakland University. An example would be your name and address for mailing admissions or employment information. Information sent to Oakland University via Web data entry may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by Oakland University staff members for the purpose of answering and tracking your request. In some cases, the university may outsource the collection of information, such as with admissions or employment applications, and your information may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by employees of a third-party vendor providing services under contract to the university.

You may be asked to enter your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information on an Oakland University Web site. This information may be kept and used for future communications. 

The university may release your personal information to third parties under provisions of Administrative Policies and Procedures. The Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act governs student data and information, and usage of Web site information must comply with this law.

**Collection of Other Information**  
Most information we gather does not identify you personally. We automatically collect information such as the type and identity of the Internet service provider you are using, your Internet protocol (IP) address, the time spent on the Web site, or the navigation path you took on the Web site. We use the gathered information to improve the navigation, flow and content of the Web site to provide you with the best possible information service.

**Special Disclosure Cases**  
Oakland University may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Oakland University's rights or property, other Oakland University users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We reserve the right to use information to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with the [Oakland University Policy for Use of University Information Technology Resources](http://www3.oakland.edu/oakland/frames.asp?main=http://www2.oakland.edu/audit) (#890) and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others. The university may disclose information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**E-Commerce Transactions**  
Some of our Web site features may use applications to collect data to facilitate an e-commerce transaction. We use an outside service with an approved banking relationship to process credit card transactions. All credit card information is encrypted and only the information needed to complete a transaction history is stored on our secure server. 

**Public Forums, Directories, Chat Rooms and Mail Lists**  
This Privacy Statement does not protect you when you use Oakland University public forums. As a service to our users, Oakland University may offer directories, chat rooms, bulletin or message boards, or mailing list groups for our Web site visitors. Any information shared in a directory, chat room, bulletin board, or other posting or online discussion is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to this Privacy Statement.

**Other Links**  
The Oakland University Web site may contain destination links to other independently run Web sites for Oakland University student groups or organizations and to some third-party sites outside the "oakland.edu" domain. Oakland University is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. These destination links are provided only for your convenience, and as such, you access them at your own risk. Any information you reveal on any such site is not subject to this Privacy Statement, therefore, you should consult the privacy policies of each site you visit. However, we wish to ensure the integrity of our Web site and its destination links, so any comments pertaining to any sites accessed through destination links on our Web site are greatly appreciated. 

**Security**  
Oakland University treats your personal information as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. This Web site has information security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We restrict access to our data center and server rooms to authorized personnel and limit access to personal information to those employees who have a legitimate business need to access such information. Despite these security measures, we do not represent or warrant that personal information will be protected against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
We may change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting revisions to our Web site. Your use of the Web site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Statement and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement or any revised statement, then please exit the Web site immediately.
