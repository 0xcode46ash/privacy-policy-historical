Access By Children  
  
---  
  
When parents or guardians permit their children to use the Internet and other electronic media, they also permit distribution of information. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and be aware of their children's use of the internet and other electronic media. No information should be provided to Oakwood, or any person or company, by children under the age of majority in their country, state and/or other community without the consent of the parent or guardian.

Preferred Partners  
  
Oakwood Corporate Housing requires Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of the information we share.Â  We carefully select these Partners to ensure your privacy and the value of their offers.

We require the same safeguards for the information received over the Internet as we do for customer information received by telephone and mail.

Security  
  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

We use the VeriSign Secure Server ID to protect your billing information. Based on the same technology used to protect nuclear missile codes, VeriSign Secure Server IDs provide the strongest security available today. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card number over the Internet. 

When our reservation form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
