# OASIS Privacy and Security - Oasis Womens Fashion Clothing Shop UK - www.Oasis-Stores.com

We believe shopping at [Oasis-stores.com](http://www.oasis-stores.com/) (part of Aurora Fashions) is as secure as shopping in store. In addition we respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognise the importance of protecting information collected from them.

We are part of Aurora Fashions and we take your privacy very seriously. We work hard to make sure that we only use your information in the ways that you want us to. This Privacy Statement explains what information we collect on this website, how and when it is collected, what we use it for now and how we will use it in the future. If you have any questions about the way in which your information is being collected or used which are not answered by this Privacy Statement please contact us at [help@oasis-stores.com](mailto:help@oasis-stores.com).

Product Information 

We have made every effort to display the colours and descriptions of our products that appear on the website as accurately as possible. However, as the actual colours you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of any colours will accurately reflect the colour of product on delivery. 

Prices are inclusive of VAT. Goods are subject to availability.

##    
No Junk Mail 

We know that everyone is busy, and nobody likes their email inbox cluttered up with junk mail.

We will only send you marketing messages if you choose to receive them from us or third parties we work with and think you may be interested in hearing from. If you choose to receive our mailings or our partner’s mailings, we will only send you details about items and promotions which we think will be of interest to you. If you decide that you no longer want to receive emails from [www.oasis-stores.com](http://www.oasis-stores.com/), you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/pws/ENews.ice?page=eNewsPage) and selecting ‘Unsubscribe’. We will never sell your details to an unconnected third party for marketing purposes.

##   
Website Security

When you shop at our website we use a 128-bit SSL encrypted secure internet connection to protect your payment details. Your computer should automatically allow the opening of the secure connection when you place your order. This means that all the details you supply and any responses are encrypted before they are sent over the internet.

##   
What information do we collect and how will we use it?

When you place an order with us we collect certain information which is required to allow us to process your transaction and deliver your order. This includes your personal details, order details, details of your address(es) and payment details. We will also ask if you are an Oasis cardholder or not.

We will use this information to process your transaction and dispatch your order.

We may at times ask for other details, for example product size and category preferences, age and any special dates (such as birthday and anniversary). These details will be used for profiling and marketing purposes. Providing us with this sort of information is entirely voluntary.

You can choose to sign up for our weekly email newsletter and to receive other marketing communications from us. By asking to receive this information you consent to receive marketing communications from us using any contact method which you have provided us with, including by post, email, SMS, MMS and telephone.

On occasion we may ask for feedback from you about the usage or services our website provides to help us develop and improve it further.

For quality control and training purposes, we may monitor or record your communications with us.

We will keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for these purposes.

##   
What you can expect from us?

We will at all times comply with the standards, procedures and requirements of UK data protection laws to ensure that the personal information you give us is kept appropriately secure and processed fairly and lawfully.

We may have to pass your information to countries or jurisdictions which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK, if necessary for the above purposes. If we do make such a transfer, however, we will (where necessary) always put a contract in place to ensure that your information is properly protected.

##   
Other people who might use your information

In order to process your order and deliver your purchases to you we may have to pass your information to some of our service providers. This includes the companies who handle our order dispatch service and our delivery company. Your contact telephone number will be passed on to our courier company who may contact you by phone or text message in order to update you on the delivery date or time of your order.

We will only provide these companies with the information which they need to carry out their jobs. They will only be allowed to use your information in the way in which we tell them, and they will not be entitled to use it in their own right.

In assessing your request for goods or services, we may use your information for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud. We may disclose your address and postcode details to check against the IMRG Security Alert or any other Fraud Prevention Scheme. At all times where we disclose your information for the purposes of fraud prevention it will remain secure. If you believe your details are incorrect you may correct those details by following the procedure below.

We will not pass your information to any third parties outside of Aurora Fashions Ltd, except where required to do so as a part of the sale, disposal or transfer of our business, in whole or in part.

##
