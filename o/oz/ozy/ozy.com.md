Because of the personal nature of reviews submitted, your name will be held confidential if you wish it so. Not even us, the operators of Talksurgery, through our secure registration form, will know your true identity

Talksurgery.com is a free website with future revenues derived from sponsorships and advertising. To attract and retain advertisers, we aggregate all personal demographic data and provide the results to advertisers so that they will understand the value of Talksurgery members as an advertising audience.

 **When does Talksurgery.com collect my personal information?**  
Talksurgery gathers information from members and visitors in four ways: voluntary registration, member-submitted reviews and bulletin board postings, cookie technology and IP addresses. **Registration**  
At the initial registration screen we ask for a Member name, password and email address. **Reviews and Bulletin Boards**  
Personal information becomes public when you disclose it to the Talksurgery web site.

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to store and track your preferences to provide you with a more personalized member experience. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies (see below) but this will prevent you from using in most customized services, and you may have to repeatedly enter personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. For example, if you choose "Automatic Login" during registration, Talksurgery will store a scrambled version of your Member ID in a permanent "cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can track your personalized services and preferences from one visit to the next. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of the talksurgery Web site are the most popular, and serve targeted advertising. No advertiser's cookie is ever placed on members' computers.

**IP Address**  
We may log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Web site). An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. When you visit a particular Web page in the Talksurgery.com Web site, our servers log your IP address.
