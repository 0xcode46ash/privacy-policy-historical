**3\. What is Personal Information**

  * Telephone number
  * Financial institution account details

**5\. Why and how TMS collects Personal Information**

Personal information is essentially collected through the Ozlotteries.com website for the primary purpose of administering the lottery-based gaming activities, ensuring that players who win prizes receive their winnings, and improving service levels to customers.

Personal information is collected from you in the following ways:

  * Through our Ozlotteries.com website and communications between you and us by correspondence (such as email, fax, letter, phone);
  * Our transaction records relating to the purchase of lottery products and services;
  * Third parties such as our affiliates, our suppliers, including lottery-based game suppliers, or your representatives; and
  * The use of 'cookies'.

What are 'cookies'? 

    * 'Cookies' are alphanumeric identifiers that are placed on your computer's hard drive through your web browser.
    * 'Cookies' enable our system to recognise your browser and maintain your purchasing details in your shopping basket.
    * By disabling 'cookies', you will not be able to participate in some of the features offered by Ozlotteries.com.
    * Most Internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive 'cookies', you may adjust your Internet browser to disable or to warn you when 'cookies' are used. As there are many browsers in the marketplace, the easiest way to change your settings is by searching for 'cookies' in your Help/Contents and Index options on your browser.
    * We recommend that you leave your 'cookies' enabled; otherwise you will not be able to purchase lottery entries with us.
    * Our 'cookies' don't send us back any information about your computer or any other information on your hard drive.



**6\. Personal Information Security**

TMS is committed to the protection of your personal information from unauthorized access. We use a range of security mechanisms and procedures to protect the personal information we hold about you.

TMS makes all reasonable efforts to ensure your personal information is stored securely both in electronic and physical forms, and complies with the NPPs. The Ozlotteries.com website pages from which you may forward to us personal information are encrypted through a password protected portal using 128 bit SSL encryption. However, there may be risks associated when transferring your personal information to us from other internet facilities or by email.

Personal information that is no longer required will be destroyed in accordance with the legislation and NPPs.

**7\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

  * Verify your name, age, address and identity;
  * Provide you with lottery-based gaming products and services;

  * Inform you of ways the services provided to you could be improved;
  * Research and develop our services;
  * Maintain and develop our business systems and infrastructure, including testing and upgrading of these systems;
  * Communicate new products and services to you, by TMS and/or its lottery-based game suppliers for marketing purposes, including and at times, the opportunity to take up special promotions and offers. You have an "opt-out" option to this communication by following the one-click unsubscribe link available at the bottom of every promotional message. We only send periodical communications to individuals who have "opted in" to receive these. We do not "spam" our customers in any manner; 
  * Address any query, feedback or complaints you may have; and
  * Contact you for any other reason.
