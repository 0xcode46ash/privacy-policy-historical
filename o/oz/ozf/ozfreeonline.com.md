Oz Free Online Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

We only collect personally identifying information about you when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us.

**Basic Statement**

Personally identifying information that you provide will not be made available to third parties outside of our network without your explicit permission.

We collect personally identifying information about you only when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us. Your personally identifying information will be used to personalize your experience within us, or for such other purposes as are described at any point where we collect this information from you.

Information that personally identifies you will be kept strictly confidential unless you specifically authorize it to be made available, as in the case of profiles.

Personally identifying information which you choose to provide to another party or Web site will be subject to their privacy policy. For example, if you send your resume to an employer or recruiter you found while searching our site, information you provide to that party is subject to their privacy policy rather than ours.

**How we gather information from users**

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, OzFreeOnline.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.

**What we do with the information we collect**

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualised content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. We currently use the following companies to help us collect Aggregated Information:

* Google Analytics  
* Nielsen NetRatings  
* StatCounter

**What Is Personally Identifying Information?**

Personally identifying information is information that can be explicitly used to identify and/or contact you as an individual. This includes, information like your real name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, etc. Information that, by itself, cannot be explicitly linked with your real identity is not considered personally identifying. Examples of this are favorite or bookmarked Web sites, or your preferences with respect to how you wish to see a given page or site set up according to the selections you choose.

On occasion, we may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We do this when you register for contests/promotions or services that require registration or subscription. We need to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, and for tracking/verifying compliance with our policies. It may also be needed for purposes of compliance with federal/state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not.

**Links To Other Sites**

Users should be aware that when you are on our site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites that take you outside our service. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the our logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up!

Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

**E-Mail To Us**

When you send us e-mail, we will use your name and e-mail address only to respond to the concerns you write to us with. Your e-mail may be shared with appropriate people within the organization to help us respond to your concerns and improve the service.

**Changes To This Policy**

From time to time, we may introduce new products and services to its users and members. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time by notifying customers, via our site, of a new privacy policy. You can send e-mail to support with any further questions.
