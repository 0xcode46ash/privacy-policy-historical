This information may be collected by us and by our third party service providers who assist us in operating the website.

Like many other websites, when you read, browse or download information from our website, we or our internet service provider may also collect information such as the date and time of your visit to the website, the pages accessed and any information downloaded. This information is used for statistical, reporting and website administration, maintenance and improvement purposes only.

Further, our website may use "cookies" from time to time. Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser. Cookies may also be used to record non-personal information such as the date, time or duration of your visit, or the pages accessed, for website administration, statistical and maintenance purposes. Any such information is aggregated and not linked to particular individuals. The default settings of browsers like Internet Explorer always allow cookies, but users can easily erase cookies from their hard-drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note that some parts of the website may not function fully for users that disallow cookies.

While we take the upmost care to protect your personal information provided via our website, twitter, facebook or directly via email, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or receive from us online. This is particularly true for information you send to us via email. We have no way of protecting that information until it is received. Once we receive your email, we make our every effort to ensure its security.

The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of those sites. Similarly, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of third parties used for ticket sales
