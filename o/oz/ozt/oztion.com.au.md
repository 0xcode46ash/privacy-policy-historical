# OZtion Privacy Policy

OZtion has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices. For additional information about OZtion, please review our User Agreement. 

**1\. Use of your information**

OZtion does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties. We release account and other personal information only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OZtion, our users, or others.

**2\. Email**

It is the policy of OZtion to send our members email throughout the auction process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, OZtion will send newsletters to members periodically. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments.

**3\. Emailing Tools**

OZtion provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to OZtion or to send references to a specific listing to a friend. You may not use the "Email to a friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.

**4\. Membership Registration**

Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information. We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our affiliated partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary.

**5\. Updating Your Personal Information**

OZtion provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc. OZtion will store previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance with our User Agreement - specifically the use of one account per member.

**6\. Control of Your Password**

You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your OZtion password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.

**7\. Credit Card Security**

We protect your credit card information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Your credit card details are not held by OZtion and can not be accessed by OZtion staff. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by ensuring you logoff when you have finished visiting OZtion using a shared computer.

**8\. Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.

OZtion mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave OZtion. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft .NET), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on OZtion.

OZtion also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit OZtion each month). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on OZtion and help us identify users abusing the OZtion service.

**9\. Other information we collect**

We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.

Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used to track users who abuse the OZtion system and will be only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in conjunction with an Internet Service Provider, to find the account of a user and, ultimately, further information to identify a user. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties.

If you choose to post messages in our message areas or leave Rating & Coments for other users, we will collect that information you provide to us.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

**10\. Membership Removal**

If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, simply send us an email requesting to be removed.

**11\. Advertising and Third Party Links**

Some OZtion advertisers may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. OZtion has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them.

OZtion contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. OZtion has no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted.

**12\. Updates to our information practices**

From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of our Web site. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on privacy practices at OZtion.
