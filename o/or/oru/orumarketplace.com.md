**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**The Information We Collect:**

Email address  
Phone number

**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use the information you provide about yourself when executing a transaction, only to complete that transaction. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction, such as shipping and delivery companies.

We use the information you provide about someone else when creating a transaction only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 12, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 12.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**  
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your **ORU Marketplace** account and view your contact details. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information at any time by editing your marketplace profile. 

We may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information, we will send a notice to the primary email address specified in your **ORU Marketplace** account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.

**Thank you and have an Orutopian day!**
