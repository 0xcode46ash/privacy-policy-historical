We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Please check their websites for respective privacy policies.

We also allow advertisers and webmasters to place an ad directly by contacting us. These ads are normally placed on the left sidebars or below the posts. We take no responsibility of the content on those sites.

We release new [orkut tools](http://www.orkutplus.net/orkut-toolkit) now and then which are PHP based because they are quickest and hassle free. Some of these tools require the users to enter their account details to make them work. **Please be rest assured that we never store any account information except otherwise noted.**

Some incredible orkut tools like [Auto Responder Reply Bot](http://www.orkutplus.net/2008/09/autoscrap-reply-bot-set-and-send-auto-replies-to-your-scraps.html) which automatically responds to received scraps stores your account details in the database to enable automation.

You can always unsubscribe to the service and remove your information from the database by logging into your control panel and disabling the service.

We have launched a free service called [Pastebin](http://www.orkutplus.net/pastebin) where users can post code snippets and share them with anyone they wish to. We do not store any personal information apart from some basic details which are used to recognize the user who created the code post.
