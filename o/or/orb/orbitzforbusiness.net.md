_What personal information we collect_

> When you first register as a member, we require that you provide us with limited contact information, including your name, email address, and organization's name. If you consented to have your organization share your personal travel information with us, we will match the limited information you provide with the travel profile you may have provided your organization. If you did not give consent directly to your organization, then at the time you register we may ask for your consent to obtain from your organization your full travel profile. Included in that profile will be more detailed personal information that you provided to your organization, such as your address, frequent flyer numbers, and credit card numbers for travel bookings. Your consent for your organization to share your travel profile with us may be necessary for you to become a member of this Site. At the time your register, you will also need to choose a password, which will be required to gain access our Site. We might also request your home zip code.
