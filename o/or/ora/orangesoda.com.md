**What Aureate Media Does**

Aureate Media (Aureate) delivers content to computer software applications that use Aureate Media's technology. In the process of delivering this content, as well as performing online transactions, Aureate will sometimes query you for demographic data (gender, age, zip code, etc.). We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (name, address, telephone number, email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. All of this information is aggregated for the purposes of reporting to advertisers and ad sales organizations the performance of their advertising campaigns. Because Aureate derives its revenue mainly from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. If you do submit your email or postal addresses online, you may receive periodic mailings from us, or our partners, with information on new services or products. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our files, please contact us at the email address privacy@aureate.com. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files. 

Aureate Media also processes software registrations. Because we need to properly charge you credit card, we must ask your name, company name, address, email address, and phone number. From this section, you have the ability to choose not to receive promotional mailings. This information is collected on a secure site using secure socket layer encryption, and has been verified by VeriSign. 

Aureate Media also takes information from software companies and individuals that use Aureate Media's advertising technology in their application. This information is used to keep track of money owed, and issue checks, to the developers. From this section, you have the ability to choose not to receive mailings that are not related to your software. The information we ask is name, email address, phone and fax number, address, tax ID or social security number, and web site. This information can be updated directly from our web site by logging in to our developer login section. 

The information that you provide will be used extensively within the Aureate Network to provide a personalized experience to you. It may also be shared with Aureate's partners that provide the software applications on our network and other third parties related or unrelated to offerings on the Aureate Network. 

**Use of Unique Identifiers**

Upon installation of a software application integrated with our advertising technology, Aureate sets a numerical identifier on your computer. This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency). It also allows us to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and avoid delivering the same ads too many times. 

On the Aureate web site, Aureate may use cookie technology to monitor user activity. Users can control this data collection and targeting method by setting cookie control options in their browser (Netscape, Microsoft, etc.) or by managing the contents of the cookies.txt file directly or by using 3rd party cookie management tools. Other than the developer login section described below, disabling cookies does not hinder access or functionality of the site. 

Aureate Media also uses cookies on the developer login section of the site to remember the developer's password while browsing. Due to this security measure, we are not able to allow access to this part of our site if the user has disabled cookies in his or her browser. 

Aureate also may use information such as browser type, operating system, and ISP, to both target advertisements as well as compile site demographics. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is for our accounting and registration purposes only. Only authorized employees of Aureate Media will have access to this information. 

**Correcting and Updating**

Software developers who have registered with Aureate Media are able to update and correct their personally identifiable data from our web site. This can be done by logging in to the developer login section of the site and clicking on the check box at the bottom of the contact Info page. 

Because Aureate does not ask personally identifiable data from software users, it is not currently possible for a user of a software application integrated with Aureate's advertising technology to update or correct their anonymous information from the database. 

**Deleting and Deactivating**

Software developers who have registered with Aureate Media are able to deactivate themselves from mailings not pertinent to the software they have on our network. This can be done by logging in to the developer login section of the site and clicking on the check box at the bottom of the contact Info page. Because Aureate does not ask personally identifiable data from software users, it is not currently possible for a user of a software application integrated with Aureate's advertising technology to delete or deactivate their anonymous information from the database. 

**Third Party Privacy**

Please be aware that Aureate advertisers or Web sites that have links in software on our network may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those Web sites linked from software on the Aureate Network. From time to time, Aureate works with third-party ad servers such as Flycast, 24/7 Media, DoubleClick, AdForce, AdSmart, TeknoSurf, and others to serve advertising to the Aureate Network. Please visit these providers individually to learn more about how they handle privacy.
