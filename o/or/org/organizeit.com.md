We never sell or share any information that is provided to us by our customers with any third party company or organization. We reserve the right to add your mailing address and email address to our database, so that we may send you special offers, catalogs and newsletters.

**Shopping Cart Security**  
Organize-It does everything in its power to ensure the security of our website. Our Shopping Cart features VeriSign SSL Encryption Security, to keep your information safe. Our VeriSign SSL Certificate features extended validation, or EV. You'll know your cart is secure when part or all of the address bar turns green. EV provides more security for personal information than standard SSL encryption. 

We also subscribe to TrustGuard, a service that preforms an in depth analysis of our site and our server to make sure it is secure from hackers. They continue to re-test our site on a daily basis to make sure it remains safe and secure.
