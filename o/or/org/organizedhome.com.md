## Privacy Policy

##### Your Privacy is Important to Us

In an effort to support privacy policy disclosures on the Internet, Threadneedle Press wishes to set an example for other Web sites by voluntarily making our privacy policy available to the public. We urge all other Web sites to do the same. 

##### Privacy Policy Statement

This information pertains to the following sites, all of which are wholly owned by Threadneedle Press: 

  * [OrganizedHome.Com](http://organizedhome.com/)
  * [HolidayOrganizer.Com](http://holidayorganizer.com/)  
  * [HouseholdNotebook.Com](http://householdnotebook.com/)
  * [Perry Bear's Fun Page](http://perrybear.com/)
  * [Threadneedle Press](http://threadneedlepress.com/)
  * [Guilds of Tri-Cities](http://members.aol.com/guildsoftc/)



For each visitor to our Web pages, our Web server automatically recognizes the name of the domain through which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you use America Online); the date and time you access our site; the Internet address from which you linked to our site (the Web page you "clicked" from to get to our page); and the individual address of the computer you used to access our site. We use this information to administer our Web site, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information. 

We collect aggregate information on what pages users access or visit and information volunteered by the user, such as specific requests by users to be added to our newsletter mailing list. 

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is used to improve the content of our Web page, used to notify users about updates to our Web sites or for the receipt of our newsletters (but only if specifically requested to do so by the user) and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

##### Cookies

Threadneedle Press uses browser cookies to facilitate your experience with our products and services.  These cookies are small sections of code that our server sends to your browser which it can then store on your hard drive.  If you choose to accept these cookies, they enable us to recognize that your browser has previously visited and used our site, products or services and, based on your browser's previous visits, assist us with tailoring the information and content, banners and promotions you view. 

An example of the customization allowed by the use of such cookies is to retain your preferred settings and last time visited for the message boards on our sites so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit.  These cookies do not collect, store or maintain your private, personally identifiable information. You do not have to accept these cookies to visit or use the site or our products and services, and you can choose to refuse our cookie, delete our cookie from your hard drive or turn off the cookie at any time by updating your user profile preferences.

##### Advertising

Occasionally, Doubleclick ads will appear on the our Web sites. Doubleclick (on any Web site their ads appear on the Internet) sets a cookie on the user's hard drive and assigns a non-random user ID number. The user is then profiled for their usage patterns any time they visit any website that displays Doubleclick advertising. 

As a user, you can temporarily disable Doubleclick's ability to profile you by not accepting cookies via your browser options. You can permanently disable Doubleclick's ability to profile you by visiting their opt-out page at <http://www.doubleclick.net/optout/>. Of course, if your Doubleclick cookie is deleted from your hard disk, you would need to opt-out again at Doubleclick's opt-out page, so you might want to bookmark the link. 

##### **Newsletter Subscription**

Threadneedle Press sites offer an option to subscribe to periodic newsletters regarding site updates, articles and news items. The only piece of information required is the user's e-mail address, which is only used to distribute the requested newsletter. You can "unsubscribe" to the newsletter at any time by e-mailing [unsubscribe@organizedhome.com](mailto:unsubscribe@infopop.com) with the subject line " **UNSUBSCRIBE.** "

##### Postings on Message Boards

It is important for you to remain aware that when you provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on any message board, that information is available to any other person or user having access and use of that message board, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage you from offering any personally identifying information within a posting to any message board.
