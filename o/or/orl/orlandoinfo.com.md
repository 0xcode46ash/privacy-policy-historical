# Orlando Travel & Visitors Bureau - Orlando Florida Vacation - Dining, Hotels, & Attractions

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name.

We collect information about users who register for programs on our site, fill out surveys, request visitor information, enter contests, communicate with us by e-mail, and make purchases on our site. We also track page views and usage patterns. We track e-mail open rates in order to monitor the effectiveness and relevance of our newsletter content.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be combined with similar information obtained from other users to help improve our site and services (for example, to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive), and to further our mission of promoting Orlando as a tourist destination. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on orlandoinfo.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of ServiceÂ and privacy policy; services and products offered by orlandoinfo.com, and our partners; information about travel to Orlando and other topics we think you might find of interest. We reserve the right to share this information with our advertisers and business partners. We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

Personally Identifiable Information may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. We will use your information only as permitted by law.

Upon request, we send out free vacation information packages to postal addresses. You will receive only the information, which you requested when you provided us your postal address.
