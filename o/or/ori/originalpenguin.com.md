# The Official Online Store for Penguin – Original Penguin® Clothes & Accessories > Privacy Policy

Original Penguin® has instituted policies and practices intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a secure manner that respects and protects your privacy. 

Any changes to our privacy policy and practices will be reflected on this page so that you can be aware of what information we collect and how we are using and/or disclosing it. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Original Penguin. Original Penguin (“Original Penguin”) is a division and wholly owned subsidiary of [Perry Ellis International, Inc](http://www.pery.com/). Our privacy policy was last updated on October 1, 2005. 

Original Penguin collects data that you provide to our company-owned channels of operation, such as OriginalPenguin.com, either through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or registrations that you submit. 

This includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an encrypted password to ensure maximum protection of your privacy (“Personal Information”). 

Original Penguin occasionally obtains email addresses of active Original Penguin customers who requested fashion emails on other websites. Original Penguin also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics. 

Original Penguin does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any Personal Information you provide to us. 

To alleviate any concern on your part, Original Penguin.com does not store or provide access to credit card information, which is why you will be required to re-enter your credit card and expiration date with every online credit card transaction. Original Penguin uses Personal Information to confirm and process sales transactions to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond to your customer service inquiries. 

Original Penguin also uses Personal Information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience and to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications directly to us online. 

You may access and edit the Personal Information that you provide online when you authenticate your right to access by signing in at OriginalPenguin.com. Simply click on [My Account](https://web.archive.org/opg/user/my_account.jsp) from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information. You can request password help at any time by clicking on the [forgot password?](https://web.archive.org/opg/service/forgot_password.jsp) link at which time OriginalPenguin.com will email an encrypted password to the associated email address. 

Currently, we do not provide online access to information that you provide to Original Penguin offline. 

All Personal Information input by you and transmitted to our website when you place an order or provide Personal Information is protected by password and by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your order and Personal Information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Original Penguin. 

Perry Ellis International does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any Personal Information you provide to us, nor do we share such Personal Information with third parties except for the express purpose of assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/opg/service/unsubscribe.jsp) from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information. 

Original Penguin honors every request to [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/opg/service/unsubscribe.jsp) from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request, not only for promotional emails that Original Penguin sends, but also for emails about Original Penguin that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers. As such, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Original Penguin will provide to such companies the email address of anyone who has submitted to Original Penguin an [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/opg/service/unsubscribe.jsp) request, provided such company agrees not to disclose or use such email address for any other purpose than honoring your request to not receive Original Penguin promotional emails. 

Original Penguin reserves the right to use and/or disclose to others Personal Information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity. 

In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Original Penguin will never knowingly request Personal Information from any person under the age of 13, without first seeking prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user of our website is under the age of 13 and has provided an online registration without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove that child's Personal Information from our files.
