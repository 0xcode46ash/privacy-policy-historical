# ORCA: Privacy

Back

### Preface

The ORCA agencies conduct public business and the records related to their businesses are generally available for public review. Nevertheless, the agencies are committed, to the extent allowable by law, to protect and secure your personal information contained in ORCA records. This privacy commitment must be balanced with the rights of public access under Chapter [42.17 RCW](http://www.leg.wa.gov/rcw/index.cfm?fuseaction=chapterdigest&chapter=42.17) (external link, Washington Public Disclosure Act) consistent with [KCC 2.14.030](http://www.metrokc.gov/mkcc/code/05-Title%202.pdf) (549K PDF; scroll down to 2.14.030) and any other applicable federal, state, and local statute or regulation.

This privacy notice does not apply to personnel files, job applications, court records, law enforcement investigation, regulatory investigation, assessor records, and recorded documents maintained by the Records, Elections, and Licensing Services division.

### Information privacy 

The agencies gather personal information when it is relevant and necessary to accomplish ORCA business. We only obtain this information through legal means. When the agencies collect personal information from you, we:

  * Tell you why we are collecting this personal information; 
  * Limit the amount of your personal information that we collect to that which is necessary for the stated purpose; 
  * Take reasonable steps to use your personal information to the stated purpose; 
  * Take steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and current; 
  * Provide your personal information only to authorized employees and private contractors or public organizations on a need-to-know basis; 
  * Do not sell or make your personal information available to others without your consent except when legally required, needed to complete your transaction with the agencies, or in an extreme emergency that presents a threat of serious injury or loss of life; 
  * Retain personal information only as long as necessary to conduct ORCA business or only to the extent required by law; 
  * Dispose of personal information in a secure manner that prevents disclosure; 
  * Take organizational, technological, and physical measures to securely safeguard personal information.

### Review and correct your personal information

Upon written request to the ORCA agencies, you may review personal information that the agencies maintain about you and ask the agencies to correct errors.

Upon written request to the ORCA agencies, you may receive a written statement that generally identifies the known circumstances under which personal information in the agencies - public records may be disclosed.
