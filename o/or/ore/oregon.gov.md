Portions of such information may be incorrect or not current. Any person or entity that relies on any information obtained from these systems does so at his or her own risk.

  1. The Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name used (but not the e-mail address). The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet IP to respond to your browser request.   _Example_ : 122.125.36.42;

  4. The date and time you visited this site;
  5. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
  6. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site. (Note: this is included so that summary analysis can be done on how visitors get to your site, i.e., from a search engine, from a link on another site, etc.)



We do not track individual user navigation choices. We do, however, summarize the information listed above to determine:

  * what organizations are our most frequent users (item 2 above) to better target our content for the audience.
  * what browsers are being used on our site to determine what techniques we can use to develop pages that will work with different browsers (item 3 above).  
  * how often our pages are being used (item 5 above). 
  * by the traffic from organization names such things as the search engines that are good at directing people to the site (item 6 above)



For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this site may monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. If security monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring to appropriate officials. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the state law and federal statutes including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996. 

**Public Disclosure**   (return to index)

All information collected at this site becomes a public record unless an exemption in law exists. [ORS Chapter 192](http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/192.html) contains the Oregon Public Records Law. and other program specific ORS's and OAR's.

In the State of Oregon, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Both state and federal laws provide exceptions. We may request personally identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, but such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a governmental office.

**Personal Information and Nondisclosure** (return to index)

"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that individual, such as an individual's name, address and telephone number. Such personal information may be exempt from disclosure if disclosure would constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the circumstances. A domain name or Internet Protocol (IP) address is not considered personal information. Most information collected by state government is assumed to be open to the public unless specifically exempted.  [ORS Chapter 192](http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/192.html) contains the Oregon Public Records Law.  Under this law, individuals are permitted to request that public officials not disclose a public record that contains their home address and telephone number under certain circumstances. ORS 192.445 specifies how to request non-disclosure.
