# Vacuum Cleaners, Air Purifiers, Floor Cleaning Products, Clean Air Products - Oreck

At Oreck Corporation, we respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our online information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy. 

## The Information We Collect

At the time you make a purchase request, we collect and store your name, address, credit card numbers and other personally-identifying information. We need this information to provide and to authorize our retail partners and service providers to provide goods and services that you Request and to let you know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested. We also use this information to customize your experience using our Website. 

We may ask you for personally-identifying information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, communicate with us, or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us your permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion. 

In addition, we automatically gather general non-personal, statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission. We may also match user information we collect with offline data available from other sources in order to carry out our services and conduct target advertising and promotions more effectively. 

## Cookies and Web Beacons

We use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Oreck.com does not require that your browser accept cookies to browse the product catalog. However, it is necessary that your browser accept cookies in order to purchase products on-line. 

Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage of our Web site, research visiting patterns, and help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners track visits and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing at our site may use their own cookies. 

Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on sites on which we advertise. These third-parties use so-called Web beacons (also known as “clear-gifs”) to gather non-personal information from visitors to our sites, such as pages viewed and information related to clicking through the ads. These third parties may also place a unique third-party cookie or cookies as a text file in your Internet browsing history files. In addition, we may use Web beacons, provided by third-party advertising companies, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. At no time will Oreck.com or its third party advertisers use Web beacons or cookies at the Oreck.com site to collect any personal information from you without your prior consent.

## The Way We Use Information

We do not sell or rent personally-identifying information collected during your use of our Website without your permission. 

We use non-personally-identifying information we collect at our site to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site’s content, layout, and services. 

We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to customize our service for you. 

We use your e-mail address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the site. We will not send you promotions or announcements unless you give us permission to do so. You can opt out of receiving such contact by sending an email to privacy@oreck.com. 

If you place a request for products or services, we use your personal information to ship your order; if the products or services are from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction. If you establish a credit account with us or our providers, we collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number and expiration date, and tracking information from checks or money orders. 

We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services. 

During the normal course of doing business, we will continue to share your information among our business units, our affiliates and unaffiliated third parties as necessary. If you obtain goods or services provided by one of our retail partners or service providers, we may exchange with the vendor personally-identified information about you for purposes of your transaction. 

At times, we need to share the e-mail addresses of those who have unsubscribed from our email list with our partners (list brokers, affiliates and broadcast email vendors) ONLY for the purpose of making sure that they too remove those email addresses from their lists. At times, we do share physical mailing addresses with reputable, trusted catalog vendors who offer quality products we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your physical mailing address with other companies, please let us know by sending an e-mail to privacy@oreck.com, and include your name and physical mailing address. You can also call us at 1-800-289-5888 or send regular mail to **Oreck Direct LLC, Attn: Privacy, 565 Marriott Dr, Nashville TN 37214**. 

## Security

We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. When you place an order at Oreck.com, our secure server software (SSL) encrypts all the information you input before it is sent to us, including your name, address, phone number and credit card number. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

## How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information

To update, correct or delete the information that we collect online you can contact send an email to privacy@oreck.com. Your account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in your not being able to access member services. 

## Children Under 13

We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. 

## Third Party Practices

The Privacy Policy of an advertiser or promotional service appearing at our site may differ from ours. We encourage you to read that policy before responding to their offers. 

## Changes to Our Policy
