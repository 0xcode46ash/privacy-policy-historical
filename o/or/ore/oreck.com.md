# Shopping at Oreck.com is safe and easy - we protect your privacy.

At Oreck.com, we collect physical mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses from customers who purchase online. We also collect email addresses from those who register with My Account at Oreck.com and those who enter an Oreck.com sweepstakes or contest.

We use the information we collect to process online orders, provide a more personalized shopping experience, and notify you of special shopping offers, discounts and sweepstakes – only when you have specifically requested to receive email from us. When you place an order at Oreck.com, our secure server software (SSL) encrypts all the information you’ve input before it is sent to us, including your name, address, phone number and credit card number. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

You may have read about "cookies," tiny nuggets of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Rest assured that our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they enable us to improve the site so that it is easier to use.

Please note that at times, we need to share the e-mail addresses of those who have unsubscribed from our email list with our partners (list brokers, affiliates and broadcast email vendors) ONLY for the purpose of making sure that they too remove those email addresses from their lists. At times, we do share physical mailing addresses with reputable, trusted catalog vendors who offer quality products we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your physical mailing address with other companies, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [privacy@oreck.com](mailto:privacy@oreck.com), and include your name and physical mailing address.
