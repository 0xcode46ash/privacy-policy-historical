These services may include, among other things, helping to provide services that you request, helping to create or maintain our databases, helping to research and analyze the people who request services information from us, and/or helping to process payment card information.

Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law. We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your personally identifiable information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal processes, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.

Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of Omaze, you, or another person.

Business Transition. If Omaze becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, your information will be transferred to the acquiring entity. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your information.

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these websites before transmitting any personal information to third parties.

What if I provide Information from Outside the United States?

Our Website is hosted in the United States and each Sweepstakes drawing takes place within the United States. Accordingly, by submitting any personal information to Omaze or enter a sweepstakes, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to such transfer.  We adhere to and have certified our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, including notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement, of the United States/European Union Data Protection Safe Harbor Framework and the United States/Switzerland Data Protection Safe Harbor Framework, both of which are made available by the U.S. Department of Commerce at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.  Our certification can also be viewed at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor. 

Dispute Resolution

California Users: Your California Privacy Rights.

We are in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Unless you provide personal information in connection with a sweepstakes, we are likely exempt from the requirements of California Civil Code section 1798.83 because we do not share such personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.  However, by providing personal information in connection with a sweepstakes or rewards program, you are expressly authorizing Omaze to share your name and contact information with both the charity benefiting from such sweepstakes and the entity providing prizes for that sweepstakes.  You expressly agree that these entities may use your information for marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at privacy@omaze.com. If you want us to stop sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact information), you may notify us at service@omaze.com. In order to fulfil certain rewards and prizes, we must share your information.  Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages. If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party (e.g., you enter into a new sweepstakes after opting-out), then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply.

How and When is the Policy Updated? How are You Notified of these Changes?

We reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time by posting the revised privacy policy on our website. If there are changes or additions to this Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats for you to review. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.

How Do We Communicate With you?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy, please contact us at service@omaze.com, or Omaze, Inc., P.O. Box 866, 9942 Culver Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232.
