If this Policy conflicts with or is inconsistent with a statement in the Rules concerning your privacy, the Rules will apply.

Please see our Terms of Use for more information on your use of this Website.

**Summary**

Although you should read through the Policy for complete information on how we collect, use, share, and secure information, the following provides a summary of some the most important aspects of or our privacy practices:

  * We may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with services, including to process donations or payments you make, to improve our services, and to provide you with information on upcoming events, announcements, and sweepstakes.

  * We take reasonable measures to secure your personal information, but we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will remain secure in all circumstances.



**What Information Do We Collect Through The Website?**

Omaze collects both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. When we refer simply to the term information in this privacy policy we are referring to how the Omaze collects, uses, or shares both the personally identifiable, and non-personally identifiable information that it collects.

Personally identifiable information refers to information that is collected in conjunction with your name. Omaze does not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want us to collect personally identifiable information about you, you can simply decide not to submit it to us.

Non-personally identifiable information refers to information that Omaze may collect from you that is not collected in conjunction with your name.

Omaze does not seek any personally identifiable information from children, and our Website is not designed to solicit, information from children under 18. To participate in any sweepstakes through this Website, you must be at least 18 years of age.

**How Do We Use This Information?**

Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with services or information that you request or to process your payments. We may also decide to use information about you to track how you use our site or to help us enhance your online experience, for example, we may access your account information to provide technical support and quality assurance. In addition, we may aggregate the personally identifiable information that you provide with the personally identifiable information that other users provide in order to conduct research, analysis, or studies for our own purposes ( _i.e_., not related to providing you with specific services), including improving our services and future sweepstakes.

We may also use the information that you provide to us to communicate with you about our current activities, future events and sweepstakes or to notify you about any changes to our services. If you decide that you would no longer like to receive such messages you can opt-out from receiving such emails from Omaze. In order to opt-out you can click on an unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of every commercial e-mail that you receive from Omaze. If you opt-out, you will continue to receive communications from us relating to any payments you make or other services you request or purchase. If you decide at a later time that you would like to receive commercial emails from us, you may be able to re-add yourself to our communication list.

**How Do We Collect This Information**

Personal Information. We collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use this Website. For example, if you create an Account, request information about our sweepstakes or submit a Comment, we will collect any information that you provide to us during such registration or in such request or submission. If you do not want us to collect personal information about you, you can simply decide not to submit it.

Like the operators of most websites, we may use tracking software and similar technology, which automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software, and use of the Website. This information may be used by us for the operation of the Website and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website.

**How Do We Protect Your Information?**

Whenever we obtain your information, we will use reasonable practices to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not insure the security of your information. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.

**How May We Share Your Information?**

Except for the following situations we do not rent, sell, or share your information with other people or companies:

Sharing Your Information with Subcontractors. In our efforts to provide the best quality service and experience to you, we may share information with subcontractors that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, helping to provide services that you request, helping to create or maintain our databases, helping to research and analyze the people who request services information from us, and/or helping to process payment card information.

Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law. We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your personally identifiable information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal processes, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.

Sharing Your Information with Law Enforcement. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies or the release of your information may protect the rights, property or safety of Omaze, you, or another person.

Business Transition. If Omaze becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale or transfer of some or all of its assets, your information will be transferred to the acquiring entity. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your information.

Your Comments. If you post a Comment to our Website, the information that you choose to post, including any personal information that you choose to post, may be available generally to the public.

Marketing Companies. We may provide general location data (e.g., the city, or the state, in which a device is located) and information about your search or posting history to third parties that want to provide you with information, products, or services. Unless we have your permission, we will only provide such companies with non-personally identifiable information. In other words, while this information may be provided in conjunction with a randomly assigned number, or a number assigned to your Omaze account, it will not be provided in conjunction with your name.

Sharing Your Information with Charities. If you make a donation in connection with entering into a sweepstakes, you agree that we may share your name and contact information with the charity we designate as the benefiting charity for such sweepstakes.

Sweepstakes Winners. As further explained in our Rules, by entering into a sweepstakes, you grant us the right to disclose name, biographical information, pictures/portraits, video images, likenesses and/or voice to the general public if you are a sweepstakes winner.

If there are changes or additions to this Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats for you to review.
