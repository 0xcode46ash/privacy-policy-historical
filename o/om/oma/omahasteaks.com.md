At OmahaSteaks.com we respect our customers and understand that you are concerned about privacy and the use of your personal information. We consider the information you choose to share with us personal and confidential. We provide this explanation about our information practices to show you our commitment to protect your privacy.

Our website is certified as a licensee of the VeriSign Secure Site Program. VeriSign is a leading provider of digital trust services that enable everyone, everywhere to engage in commerce and communications.

**The Information We Collect**  
At the time you register on our site, make a purchase request or agree to participate in a promotion, we collect and store the following types of information:

> Name  
>  Address  
>  E-mail address  
>  Telephone number  
>  Credit/Debit Card Information  
> 

We need this information to provide goods and services that you request and to let you know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested. We may also use this information to customize your experience using our website.

We may ask you to submit information about other people if you order a gift to be sent directly to the recipient. In such circumstances, we will ask for the recipient's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

We may ask you for personally-identifying information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, communicate with us, or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us your permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion or the third party who may forward marketing or other materials on our behalf.

We may automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, transactions completed, etc. To do this, we use action tags and cookies provided by our site analytics and marketing partners. Although these partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we authorize how that data may and may not be used.

Our web-site analytics partners use this data in the aggregate to determine how visitors use our site so we can improve website experiences. In addition, this information is used to better serve you with appropriate and relevant marketing offers.

As part of our service, we use cookies to store and track information about you on our website. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it on subsequent visits; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users, and research visiting patterns. If you disable cookies on your computer, you will not be able to purchase Omaha Steaks online.

**The Way We Use Information**  
Because our goal is to provide products that best meet your needs, we evaluate your personal interactions with us in an effort to bring you the products which best suit your tastes. In addition, we use your information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.

We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new products, services and promotions. At times we may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to customize our products and services for you.

The email addresses that we collect are used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes and are not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes unless you've requested to receive email offers from carefully selected marketing partners of Omaha Steaks.

When you supply us with your postal address or phone number online you may receive periodic mailings or phone calls from us and you may receive mailings from other reputable companies. If you would rather not receive such offers, just call or write to let us know.

If you place a request for products or services, we use your personal information to ship your order; if the products or services are from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction. If you establish a credit account with us or our providers, we collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number and expiration date, and tracking information from checks or money orders.

We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes or investigate problems. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to manage our website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.

We are committed to preventing others from unauthorized access to the personal information you provide to us, and we maintain procedures and technology designed for this purpose. We take several steps to protect the information we have about you, including the following:

> We update and test our technology on a regular basis in order to improve the protection of customer information.
> 
> We require outside companies and independent contractors to whom we provide customer information for marketing, servicing or processing purposes to restrict the use of the information to those purposes and we prohibit independent use of such information.
> 
> Access to your information is controlled by strict internal procedures. We maintain policies about the proper physical security of workplaces and records.
