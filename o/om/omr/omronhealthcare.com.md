# Privacy Policy

**The Security of Your Personal Information**

 **What Personal Information We Collect**

We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the Omron Healthcare Web site. We may ask for personal information when you contact our Customer Service. This will allow us to protect your confidentiality by verifying your identity.

Omronhealthcare.com does not intentionally collect personal information about children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 and would like to use omronhealthcare.com, please ask a parent or guardian for assistance.

 **Cookies and Other Computer Information**

When you visit Omronhealthcare.com, you will be assigned a temporary "cookie" (a small text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our site so we can enhance your experience.

You can choose to visit at Omronhealthcare.com without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of our site. These features include remembering your password (so you don't have to log in each time you visit), providing a more personalized experience. To visit without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to Omronhealthcare.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring Web site, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to our site and will not sell or rent this information to any unaffiliated third parties.

 **Contacting Omronhealthcare.com**

We will use your email address to respond to your questions, suggestions, and/or requests for assistance in using our site.

 **Other Times We May Collect Personal Information**

From time to time, Omronhealthcare.com may conduct surveys and contests via our Web site, email, and other media. If you choose to participate, we may request your name, email address, mailing address and other personal information. We will not sell or rent such information to any unaffiliated third parties.

 **How We Use Your Personal Information**

Information we collect on Omronhealthcare.com may be used to enhance your experience in the following ways:

  * Respond to your customer-service inquiries or requests
  * Communicate special offers and featured items to you, if you choose to receive such notices
  * Customize your experience
  * Share special offers from Omron partner organization



 **When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information**

We will not sell or rent your personal information to any unaffiliated third parties under any circumstances. We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer requests; offering certain products and services in connection with our Web site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' experience; enabling access to our partners' sites.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

 **How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information**

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

Omronhealthcare.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a Omronhealthcare.com Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.

 **How You Can Decide What Marketing Communications You Receive From Us**

If you choose to receive periodic communications from us, Omronhealthcare.com may from time to time send you email messages describing new items, featured merchandise and special offers. You can choose to stop receiving this email at any time. Simply go to Your Account, sign in, click "Email Address & Password" and remove the check in the box next to the words "Sign Up & Save! Send me email about special offers, Rollbacks, new items and other great values."

The only email messages you will receive from Omronhealthcare.com when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to respond to your Customer Service inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.

 **More About Your Privacy**

We realize that visiting Omronhealthcare.com or any other Web site, requires trust on your part. We value your trust very highly, and pledge to you, our customer, that we will work to protect the security and privacy of any personal information you provide to us and that your personal information will only be used as set forth in this Policy. This includes your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit-card information, in addition to any other personal information that can be linked to you, personally.

We believe that you have a right to know, before visiting at Omronhealthcare.com or at any other time, exactly what information we might collect from you, why we collect it and how we use it.

Omron Healthcare Inc. does not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. You have the right to control your personal information as you see fit. We collect only the personal information you allow us to collect, and then it is used only to help us serve you better.

 **Changes to the Omronhealthcare.com Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy was posted on Omronhealthcare.com on May 5, 2010. We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this policy at any time. If we make any significant change to this policy, we will post notice of the change on Omron.com for a period of at least six months after the change is implemented.
