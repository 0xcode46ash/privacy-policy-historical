2.2       Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.  When you visit our Site, you will be assigned a unique, temporary “cookie” (a small text file) to be stored on your computer’s hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our site so we can enhance your experience. The cookie does not reveal any personal information about you, but helps us understand visitors’ traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site better.

You can choose to visit our Site without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features and services of our site. These features and services include remembering your password (so you don’t have to login each time you visit) and providing a more personalized experience. To visit without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

Our Apps use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Software. By using permanent cookies we can recognize you at your use of the Software. We use a permanent cookie (“NIS”) that stores an account identifier on the login page so that it is easier for you to login to the Software in the future. Using the log out function in the Software will permanently delete this cookie, unless you have ticked ‘Remember Me.’ Permanent cookies can also be deleted via the settings of your web browser. We use a Session cookie (“OmronUSProduction”) to remember your login details whilst you are using the Software, making it possible for you to navigate within the Software without the need to constantly re-login at each page. Without this cookie, functionality of the App will be significantly impaired. This session cookie is automatically deleted every time you close your web browser.

We and our advertising partners also use cookies to provide relevant advertising to you. (See, “ _Advertising_ ” below.)

**3\. How we use and share your information  
**3.1       To Provide Products, Services, and Information. As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide you the information and services available at and through the Site, and provide information that you request from us.  When you purchase products available through our online store, your personal information is shared with and used by our online store service provider to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship products to you.  We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings, as well as newsletters, surveys, sweepstakes and contests. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us.

We may use third parties to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.

3.2       Advertising. Some websites may belong to ad networks that use your browsing history across the Internet, to choose which ads to display on their sites; the displayed ads may include advertising for Omron Healthcare. We allow select third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our Site and to use that information to serve ads for Omron Healthcare. These companies use non-personally identifiable information such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID, and IP address, during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide interest-based advertisements. To learn more, and to opt out of seeing interest-based advertisements on these external websites, visit the _[Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)_ or the _[Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)_. Sites may also offer their own opt out methods for interest based advertising. Please note that if you opt-out of receiving interest based advertising, you will still receive ads that will not necessarily be tailored to your interests.

Our Site utilizes Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google collects cookie and usage data, and utilizes the data to track and examine the use of our site, and to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. To learn more, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit the _[Google Privacy Page](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)_.

Our site utilizes Google Adwords, an online advertising program provided by Google. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network, DoubleClick. We use Google to show you interest-based advertisements based on your activity on our Site and other websites. Currently, our Site does not recognize if your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads. You can, however, obtain more information about Google’s advertising services, including your opt-out rights, [here](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en).

Our Site utilizes Bazaarvoice, a user generated product review service provided by Bazaarvoice, Inc. (“Bazaarvoice”).

Bazaarvoice customizes the display of the Site based on what items users have submitted reviews, comments or other feedback against; remember when you were last asked a question, to avoid asking you the same question too many times; remember whether you have made a preference as to how you would like to view parts of the website (ie. mobile/full desktop); and identify anonymous users who rank content as “helpful” or who report “inappropriate content.” To learn more, and to opt out of Bazaarvoice, visit the _[Bazaarvoice Privacy Page](http://www.bazaarvoice.com/privacy-policy)_.

Our Site utilizes Crazy Egg, a heat mapping service provided by Crazy Egg, Inc. (“Crazy Egg”). Crazy Egg tracks the areas of a page where users most frequently move the mouse or click. This shows where the points of interest are. These services make it possible to monitor and analyze web traffic and keep track of user behavior. To learn more, and to opt out of Crazy Egg, visit the[ Crazy Egg Privacy Page](http://www.crazyegg.com/privacy).

Our Site utilizes MailChimp, an email address management and message sending service provided by MailChimp Inc. (“MailChimp”).

  * Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations.
  * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
  * Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Omron, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law.



3.5       Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.  If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently.
