**The Security of Your Personal Information**

**What Personal Information We Collect**  
We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the Omron Healthcare website (“Website”) or any Omron Healthcare web or mobile app (“App” or “Software”). We may ask for personal information such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone number when you contact our customer service and/or register a product. We may collect personal information such as name, email address, and HEALTH RELATED DATA as defined below, when you use one of our Apps. “Personal information” means any information pertaining to an identifiable individual.

Omron Healthcare does not intentionally collect personal information about children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 and would like to use our Website or Apps, please ask a parent or guardian for assistance.

When you provide us with your personal information, you consent and agree to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may choose not to provide some or all of your personal information to us, but this may prevent us from providing our services to you or limit our ability to provide you with the level of service that you would otherwise expect from us.

**Cookies and Other Computer Information**  
When you visit our Website, you will be assigned a unique, temporary “cookie” (a small text file) to be stored on your computer’s hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our site so we can enhance your experience. The cookie does not reveal any personal information about you, but helps us understand visitors’ traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site better.

You can choose to visit our Website without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features and services of our site. These features and services include remembering your password (so you don’t have to login each time you visit) and providing a more personalized experience. To visit without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

Our Apps use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Software. By using permanent cookies we can recognize you at your use of the Software.

Using the log out function in the Software will permanently delete this cookie, unless you have ticked ‘Remember Me.’ Permanent cookies can also be deleted via the settings of your web browser. We use a Session cookie (“OmronUSProduction”) to remember your login details whilst you are using the Software, making it possible for you to navigate within the Software without the need to constantly re-login at each page. Without this cookie, functionality of the App will be significantly impaired. This session cookie is automatically deleted every time you close your web browser.

All information will be stored on secure data servers in the United States of America. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

**When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information**  
We will not sell or rent your personal information to any unaffiliated third parties under any circumstances. We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer requests, offering certain products and services in connection with our Website and Apps, communicating to customers, providing customer service, enhancing and improving customers’ experience and enabling access to our partners’ sites. Any information shared with a third party will not be beyond what is necessary and each third party will maintain its own privacy policy and enter into an appropriate data protection agreement with us.

On rare occasions, we may disclose personal information upon government request, in response to a court order, when permitted or required by law, to enforce our Website and App policies, or to protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.

We might disclose personal information in connection with a corporate transaction. If we intend to sell or transfer ownership or control of any or all of our business, operations or services to a third party, we reserve the right to disclose certain personal information to a potential buyer both before and after the purchase, subject to conditions discussed below. However, if the sale goes through, we will require that the receiving party agree that they will be similarly bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy and that they will only use and disclose your personal information as we are similarly entitled under this Privacy Policy. If the sale does not go through, we will require the potential purchaser to not use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever and to completely erase the data.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

**How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information**  
The security of your personal information is very important to us.

In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

Omron Healthcare has also obtained a digital certificate from GeoTrust, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site, which is any page containing any of your personal information, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an authorized web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.

We will notify you as promptly as possible of any privacy breach after discovering or receiving notification of the breach, if we reasonably believe the information has been acquired by an unauthorized person or is subject to an unauthorized use. Access to our databases is restricted to authorized personnel and is password protected.

**How You Can Decide What Marketing Communications You Receive From Us**

You can choose to stop receiving this email at any time by contacting us [here](http://www.omronhealthcare.com/contact/).

The only email messages you will receive from Omron Healthcare when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to respond to your customer service inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about us. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.
