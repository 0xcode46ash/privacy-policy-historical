# Omega Financial, Inc. Privacy & Data Security Policy

             Omega Financial, Inc. Privacy & Data Security Policy
                                         Effective May 2004
At Omega Financial, Inc. ("Omega") your privacy and the security of your data is a top priority.
We pride ourselves on our ability to be your chapter's partner for financial success. In order to
be this partner, we help fraternities and sororities manage their membership and alumni/ae data,
and we collect and process payments and contributions from those members and alumni/ae for
Greek organizations. This Privacy and Data Security Policy describes the privacy policies
applicable to Omega's business operations and websites.
Data Collection
One of Omega's primary services is to collect, maintain and manage individually identifiable
information about chapters, their undergraduate members and new members and their alumni/ae.
As a result, we maintain contact information, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social
security numbers, giving and payment information and other personally identifiable information
about individuals. We obtain this information from your chapter, alumni/ae organizations
associated with your chapter and your Inter/National Headquarters. We also obtain this
information from transactions you initiate and information you provide to us.
From time to time, we also compile online transaction and registration information for internal
analyses and internal marketing purposes.
Information Sharing
Omega never sells or provides any data or personally identifiable information except as
authorized by our customers or their members.
In order to serve your needs, we may share information with:
ยง   Credit card processors and financial institutions when necessary to process payments made
    by you and to comply with applicable law;
ยง   Lawyers and collection agents only when instructed and authorized by our customers to
    fulfill the terms of our agreement with our customers;
ยง   The U.S. Post Office and printing and mail house specialists in order to communicate with
    you;
ยง   Your Inter/National Headquarters in an effort, to keep you, your chapter and its members and
    alumni/ae informed about the national fraternity/sorority.
In order to enhance and strengthen the alumni relations program for our customers, name,
address, phone number and email information about their alumni/ae is published on the Internet
as a component of a customer's website.
When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order or
subpoena or when otherwise legally required.


To protect your confidential information, we only work with companies and financial institutions
that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of the information we
provide. We do not permit these companies to sell to other third parties the information we
provide to them.
Confidentiality and Security Safeguards
Omega takes physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against anticipated and
unanticipated hazards to the information that is stored about our customers, chapters, chapter
members and their alumni/ae. Data is electronically backed-up every night. Back- up tapes are
stored in secure locations off-site each week.
We protect customer data and accounts by asking you for information that only you should know
when you contact us. We follow these procedures in our financial centers, on the phone and via
the Internet.
We train our employees to protect customer information. Omega employees who have access to
confidential information must treat it confidentially and may not disclose it to unauthorized
parties. Employees who violate Omega's privacy policy are subject to a range of disciplinary
actions.
Web Site Data Collection
A visitor to the Omega website who does not log- in, is not asked to reveal any individually
identifiable information. We collect some non-personally identifiable information about visitors
through standard weblogs, including IP address, what browser is being used and the domain
name from which a visitor entered our site. Some data may be traced to an individual, but we do
not normally seek to identify individuals unless we believe that someone is using our site
improperly.
Member Access Plus and Chapter DeskTop
Some existing customers and chapter members come to our website with IDs and passwords
already assigned. Others who register at our website provide standard contact information such
as name, mailing and email address, chapter name, college/university name and telephone
numbers. We may also obtain credit card number information from those who pay online.
When you sign in to the Omega system, your ID and password are sent over the Internet from
your computer to ours using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your personal
information before it leaves your computer, ensuring that no one else can read it.
Cookies
We use an Internet device called a cookie to store login or other information on your computer.
A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to


simplify your access and to make our website work for you. For some services, we offer users
the choice of having an ID or password stored in a cookie so that you do not have to reenter it
when you return to the site. We do not store credit card numbers in cookies. No other site can
read a cookie, and we cannot read a cookie that another website wrote to your computer. Most
Internet browsers are set to accept cookies. To fully use our website, you must enable your
Internet browser to accept cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies, some websites may not
displa y properly or you may not be able to access certain information.
Privacy of Children
The Omega website and services provided by Omega are not directed to children under the age
of 13. We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable
information from, anyone under 13 years of age.
Updates to this Privacy Policy
To keep up with the rapidly evolving Internet environment and changing legal requirements,
Omega will from time to time review and revise this Privacy Policy. When any change is made
to this policy, we will revise the effective date at the beginning of this policy. Individuals and
chapters are encouraged to check back often to learn about any changes to this policy.
