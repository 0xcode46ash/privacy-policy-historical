We respect your right to privacy! Any and all information collected at this site will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Any information you give OMB Watch will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. A more detailed explanation about how we care for your personal information is described below. If you have any questions, please let us know.

OMB Watch does not track individual visitors to our Web site. Our site captures limited information about visits to our site, but we use this information only to analyze general traffic patterns (e.g. what pages are most/least popular) and to perform routine system maintenance.

If you choose to email us and provide personally identifiable information about yourself, we will not use the information for any purpose other than to respond to your inquiry.

OMB Watch maintains several email lists, and individuals may always choose whether they want to be on a list or not. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease or otherwise disclose the addresses on our lists to anyone. In addition, we configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the email addresses of our list subscribers to anyone but authorized staff and list administrators.
