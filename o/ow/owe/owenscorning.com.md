# Owens Corning Privacy Policy

  


Owens Corning respects the privacy of every individual who visits our web site, sends us e-mail or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement states how Owens Corning will collect, use and disclose information it collects from you. This Privacy Statement may be changed at any time, and Owens Corning will notify you of any such changes by posting an updated version of the Privacy Statement on this page of the web site.

Personally-Identifiable Information   
There are several opportunities on our web site for you to provide us with personally-identifiable information about you (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) and your interests. If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it to provide you with an individualized user experience and for marketing research and other marketing purposes. This may include sharing it with other companies in the Owens Corning family, our third-party business partners, and/or our third-party business consultants and providers (collectively, "Providers") so that they may contact you for direct marketing purposes, including offers of discounts on services.

Non-Personal Information  
Sometimes, we may collect non-personal information about you that is anonymous data. The information we receive is for Owens Corning's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form. Examples of this information include the length and time of your visit, the pages you looked at on our site, the type of Internet Browser you have and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We use this information to develop ideas for improving our site and to measure site activity. This may include sharing it with our Providers.

Cookies  
Our web site makes use of "cookie" files to customize information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your Browser, which may store some information on your computer. Then, when you come back to our site, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit. Most Internet Browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions to learn more about these functions.

Site Links  
Owens Corning may establish relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to our site to link directly to sites operated by these partners. We choose our business partners carefully. However, Owens Corning is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party web sites that may be linked to this site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only and do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Owens Corning of the content, policies or practices of such sites nor any products or services which may be offered through that site. Once you have left the Owens Corning site via such a link, you should check the applicable Privacy Statement of the third party site. 

Security  
Your personally identifiable information is one of our valuable assets. It is kept in a secure datacenter and is accessible only to authorized personnel as needed to perform operations governed by this Privacy Statement. Please keep in mind that despite these measures, Owens Corning cannot guarantee or warrant 100% security of its servers and databases. Moreover, Owens Corning cannot guarantee that personally-identifiable information that you submit through the Site will not be intercepted. 

Children  
Owens Corning has no intention of collecting any personal information from individuals under 18 years of age. If a child has provided us with personal information without the consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian should contact us at [answers@answers.owenscorning.com](mailto:answers@answers.owenscorning.com) if they would like us to use reasonable effort to delete this information from our files. 

Contact Information and Access to Personally-Identifiable Information  
You may review and change the personally-identifiable information associated with your account by logging in to your account and clicking the "Edit My Profile" link. If you do not want your personal information collected or shared, or if you would like to delete your account, please contact Owens Corning at [answers@answers.owenscorning.com](mailto:answers@answers.owenscorning.com) and we will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our files and will also use reasonable efforts to instruct a Provider to delete your information from its files. Please note, however, that your personally-identifiable information is the basis for your account and your election to not have it shared or collected will result in the deletion of your account.
