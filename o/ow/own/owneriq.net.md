# OwnerIQ - Privacy Policy

[Opt Out](https://web.archive.org/web/20090830174503id_/http%3A//owneriq.net/opt-out.php)

###### OwnerIQ Privacy Policy:

Your privacy is OwnerIQ's top priority. At OwnerIQ we collect information about the products and services that people own, use or have shown interest in, and use that information to help our advertising and publishing partners provide relevant advertising and content to those people as they surf the internet. We gather only anonymous information about users from our owned and operated websites, where we provide free access to user manuals and support information, as well as from third-party websites we have partnered with to help gather this anonymous information ("Partner Websites").

The below information about our privacy policy, what information we gather and what we do with it, are meant to provide you, the consumer, with full disclosure. We do this to ensure that you are informed as to how we handle this anonymous information on behalf of our publisher, advertising network and advertising partners.

_How we Collect Anonymous Information_ : OwnerIQ enables its owned and operated sites and it's Partner Websites to collect anonymous information on users with a particular focus on the products and services that people own and use, or those they have an interest in. The technologies utilized allow OwnerIQ to collect this information entirely anonymously. Neither the Partner Website nor OwnerIQ will ever be able to identify you individually based on the information that is collected. Anonymity is the foundation of this information gathering solution.

Data Collection Technologies:

**Cookies:** OwnerIQ, like almost all websites, uses a simple technology feature of your browser to place a cookie on your hard drive. Cookies are used by web sites to recognize a computer they have encountered before. Cookies do not include any information which is personal to you or would allow anyone to identify you individually. The cookie simply tells us that we have encountered your computer in the past when you have visited an OwnerIQ Website, or a Partner Website. Most of the web sites you visit use cookies to enhance the users experience on those sites.

**Clear GIFs & Servers:** We also use electronic images known as "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", "pixel tags" or "web beacons" — that allow OwnerIQ and our partners, including third party ad networks and exchanges to track general user traffic patterns. OwnerIQ also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.

_How we Use Anonymous Information_ : OwnerIQ operates an advertising platform and participates in advertising exchanges, where we help match advertisers, publishers, manufacturers and service providers with consumers based on products and services that those consumers own, use or have shown an interest in. We use the anonymous information gathered through cookies and “web beacons” to enable this advertising and content matching, providing the most relevant and informative advertising available to consumers as they travel the web.

###### What Information Is Collected?

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
Through use of the date collection methods, OwnerIQ collects anonymous data while you are visiting its web site or a Partner Website, including advertisers, advertising exchanges and Web publishers. This anonymous data includes information such as a users IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to identify your computer), web pages which have been viewed by the user, date and time, and responses by a user to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. Our advertising platform partners, as well as OwnerIQ use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons as described above.

In addition users may provide us with additional non-personally identifiable information. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be provided with the users consent would include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual's personally identifiable information. Web surfers may elect not to allow us to use anonymous data by following the OwnerIQ [Opt-Out](https://web.archive.org/web/20090830174503id_/http%3A//owneriq.net/opt-out.php) process.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
OwnerIQ does not ask for or receive any PII as a result of its use of the anonymous data collection technologies used to gather information about product preferences as described above. This process is always anonymous. At our Partner Websites, however, they may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable information in relation to the services provided or products sold on that site. The privacy policy for that Partner Website controls under those circumstances. OwnerIQ prohibits the passing of PII by Partner Websites to OwnerIQ and is committed to making sure that our Partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.

Other Information that is Collected:

On the OwnerIQ website ([www.owneriq.com](http://www.owneriq.com/)) we may collect PII on individuals or companies who are inquiring about doing business with OwnerIQ in some capacity. We do maintain this information for the purpose of assessing working relationships with the individuals or companies who have submitted information. For example, if an individual submitted their email address and asked for information regarding an OwnerIQ product, we will maintain that information for purposes of assessing the opportunity and potentially contacting that individual and/or company with a response to the inquiry. This information will not be used for any other purpose, excepting as may be required by.

###### What we do with Non-Personally Identifiable (Anonymous) Information

OwnerIQ will use non-PII in a number of ways. It will be used to:

  * Keep count of return visits to our site or our Partners' sites
  * Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on Web site and content usage to our partners and our own sites
  * Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests
  * OwnerIQ partners with third party ad networks and exchanges to display its customers' ads throughout these third party networks. These third party ad networks and exchanges may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display. We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers', publisher’s and Partner Site’s use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.



###### Third-Party Disclosure of Non-PII?

Disclosure of Anonymous, Aggregated Information

We aggregate user information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. OwnerIQ also discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 15% of people anonymously identified by OwnerIQ own plasma TVs) in order to describe our services to prospective customers and partners, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

###### Third-Party Disclosure of PII

OwnerIQ does not disclose PII to any third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OwnerIQ may at any time disclose Member Details and any other information collected to third parties if we are required to do so by law, warrant, subpoena, regulation or court order.

###### Security

OwnerIQ has implemented reasonable security measures to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, audits of procedures, and regular reviews of overall Web security.

###### General Registration Security Question & Answer:

**Links:** The OwnerIQ site may contain links to other Websites. OwnerIQ is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. Users should be aware of this when they leave our site and review the privacy statements of each Web site they visit that collects information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by OwnerIQ.

If all or part of OwnerIQ is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the Member Details that you have provided to us along with Clickstream Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. In these circumstances, OwnerIQ will require that the information be used by its successor in a manner that is consistent with the OwnerIQ Privacy Policy in effect at the time OwnerIQ received the information.

**Amendments:** OwnerIQ may modify or amend this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, as determined by OwnerIQ, in the way in which information is collected, used or transferred, we will notify you of these changes on our site(s) or by e-mail and provide a link to the new privacy statement. If you object to any of the changes, you can have us delete your information from our database by contacting [webmaster@owneriq.com](mailto:webmaster@owneriq.com).
