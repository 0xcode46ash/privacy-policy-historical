# Homes For Sale By Owner - Search, Buy, Sell - Owners.com Real Estate

Owners.com is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. The following explains how your information will be treated as you make use of our products and services. 

## Your Information

Owners.com draws a distinction between information that is provided when registering on the site and information that is provided when listing your property for sale on our Web site. 

## Personal Information

Personal information is defined as information entered when registering on our Web site. Owners.com does not sell or distribute any of your individual personal information to other companies or vendors. We will not release any of your personal information to other users without your permission. We may use or provide partners with aggregate information from the information provided by all users. 

## Listing Information

Listing information is defined as information that is provided when a user signs up to list his/her property on our Web site. In order to provide the maximum exposure for properties listed on our site, Owners.com has formed partnerships with many other listing services on major Internet portals and other sites. These partners are provided with your listing information so that your property can be viewed with some detail on our partners' sites. "Active Until Sold" and "No Expiration" refers to your Owners.com listing. Distribution to or on any premium partner site(s) through a paid feature or listing package is limited to 6 months from the original purchase date, or until otherwise expressly stated. When your listing information is received by Owners.com, your listing contact information is automatically transferred to our partners' sites on a daily basis. If you request address specific products or services we will transfer your listing contact information as required by vendors, unless you specify otherwise. All customers are provided with the option of withholding the posting of any or all listing contact information. 

## Credit Card Information

Owners.com accepts credit card information to provide our customers with the convenience of purchasing our products and services online. Credit card information is defined as any information that appears on a page where a credit card number can be submitted. All credit card information is protected by SSL encryption technology. Once submitted, we store only the information required to reference your original transaction (which cannot be used to process another charge transaction), and do not store your credit card number or any other identifiable account information on file.

Owners.com uses your computer's IP address to administer our Web site and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. Individual user information is not released. We may also lookup your IP address' approximate location to help personalize your experience by offering services or features specific to your area.
