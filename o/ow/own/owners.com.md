# Owners.comÂ® - Privacy Policy and Security Statement

Owners.com is dedicated to safeguarding your privacy online. The following explains how your information will be treated as you make use of our products and services. 

Owners.com draws a distinction between information that is provided when registering on the site and information that is provided when listing your property for sale on our Web site. 

Personal information is defined as information entered when registering on our Web site. Owners.com does not sell or distribute any of your individual personal information to other companies or vendors. We will not release any of your personal information to other users without your permission. We may use or provide partners with aggregate information from the information provided by all users. 

Listing information is defined as information that is provided when a user signs up to list his/her property on our Web site. In order to provide the maximum exposure for properties listed on our site, Owners.com has formed partnerships with many other listing services on major Internet portals and other sites. These partners are provided with your listing information so that your property can be viewed with some detail on our partners' sites. When your listing information is received by Owners.com, your listing contact information is automatically transferred to our partners' sites on a daily basis. If you request address specific products or services we will transfer your listing contact information as required by vendors, unless you specify otherwise. All customers are provided with the option of withholding the posting of any listing contact information. 

Owners.com accepts credit card information to provide our customers with the convenience of purchasing our products and services online. Credit card information is defined as any information that appears on a page where a credit card number can be submitted. All credit card information is protected by SSL encryption technology. Once submitted, your credit card information is stored behind our firewall to ensure that it remains safe and secure. Your credit card information will not be distributed unless Owners.com has your permission or unless Owners.com in good faith believes that the law requires it. 

In order to enhance your visit with personalized services, Owners.com makes use of cookie technology. A cookie is a small file that is assigned to a user when they register on a Web site. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, nor are they shared with our partners and vendors. We use cookie technology to track the way in which customers use the site so that we can provide them with content that caters to their needs. We also use cookies to make your visit more convenient by saving your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

IP addresses are unique to each computer, and they are used to identify senders and receivers of information over the Internet. Owners.com uses your computer's IP address to administer our Web site and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. Individual user information is not released. 

Owners.com occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Individual user information is not released. 

At Owners.com, we are committed to maintaining a secure environment to store and receive your personal information. As stated in the credit card information section, Owners.com receives your credit card information using industry standard SSL encryption. 

All of the information transmitted to Owners.com is stored safely and securely behind our firewall. A firewall is a buffer that isolates our network from the Internet. 

At Owners.com, we constantly monitor our Web security in order to protect your information. Once your information is received at Owners.com, access to your information is limited. Each employee is provided with a copy of this document so that they are aware of our privacy practices.
