**_Your Information_**

**Owners.com** draws a distinction between information that is provided when registering on the site and information that is provided when listing your property for sale on our Web site. 

**Personal Information**  


Personal information is defined as information entered when registering on our Web site. **Owners.com** does not sell or distribute any of your individual personal information to other companies or vendors. We will not release any of your personal information to other users without your permission.

We may use or provide partners with aggregate information from the information provided by all users. 

**Listing Information**  


Listing information is defined as information that is provided when a user signs up to list his/her property on our Web site. In order to provide the maximum exposure for properties listed on our site, **Owners.com** has formed partnerships with many other listing services on major Internet portals and other sites. These partners are provided with your listing information so that your property can be viewed with some detail on our partners' sites. When your listing information is received by **Owners.com** , your listing contact information is automatically transferred to our partners' sites on a daily basis. If you request address specific products or services we will transfer your listing contact information as required by vendors, unless you specify otherwise. All customers are provided with the option of withholding the posting of any listing contact information.

**IP Address**  


IP addresses are unique to each computer, and they are used to identify senders and receivers of information over the Internet. **Owners.com** uses your computer's IP address to administer our Web site and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. Individual user information is not released. 

**Contests and Surveys**  


**Owners.com** occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Individual user information is not released.
