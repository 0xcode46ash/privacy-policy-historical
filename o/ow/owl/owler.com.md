# Owler - Privacy Policy

## PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: May 10, 2013

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed with respect to your use of our website located at [www.owler.com](https://www.owler.com/) (the "Site") and the software and services provided by Owler, Inc. ("Owler", "we" or "us") and accessed through the Site and your mobile device (the "Owler Service") so you can make an informed decision about using the Owler Service. By using the Owler Service, you represent that you are 13 years old or older and consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as may be modified by us from time to time. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the top of the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the Site following the posting of such changes or revised statement shall constitute your consent to any changes in our privacy practices, and you expressly waive any right to notice of such changes. We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you visit our Site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. 

### What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit the Site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the Site.

### 1\. Personal Information You Choose to Provide

#### Registration Information

You will provide us information about yourself when you register to be a user of [www.owler.com](https://www.owler.com/), register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and alerts. We may combine information you provide with information from third party sources to improve your experience with our Site and Service. 

You can use the "My Account" section to learn more about the information associated with your account. You may also provide additional comments on how you see [www.owler.com](https://www.owler.com/) servicing your needs and interests. 

#### Communication Information

If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. If you choose to sign up for an email newsletter, we will send the newsletter to the email address you register with us. If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter, you may do so by using the unsubscribe link in the newsletter. If you choose to communicate via SMS through one of our services that offers SMS technology, we may retain the content of the message together with the phone number and wireless carrier, as well as the date and time the message was received or sent.

#### Location Data

If you use any mobile application in connection with the Owler Service, we may receive information about your actual location, or information that can be used to approximate your location, including GPS signals sent by your mobile device and your mobile identification.

### 2\. Website Use Information

Similar to other commercial websites, the Site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how the Site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the websites visited just before and just after our Site. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.

#### What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to notify you whenever a cookies is being sent, and to refuse all cookies. Please note that some features for the Owler Service may not function properly if cookies are disabled for your browser.

#### How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?

As you browse through our Site, the Site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other Owler users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.

#### Sharing Information with Third Parties

We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed by us for your use. We may also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.

### How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our users and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at [support@owler.com](mailto:support@owler.com). 

### How Do We Protect Your Information?

#### How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to all of our data. This includes internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, as well as an assessment of our encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to a limited number of our employees, partners and agents. These individuals and entities are bound by confidentiality agreements and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet any obligations required under their agreement with us.

#### How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?

When you use our Site, we make every effort to provide you with access to your personal information and will correct this data if it is inaccurate or delete it at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

#### Certain Disclosures

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Site, the users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated Parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the Site, us, or third parties.

#### Enforcement

We regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. To our knowledge, we comply with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 and the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement. We take all of your concerns seriously and will review any written complaints received by us. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between any of our members and us.

#### What About Other Websites Linked to Our Site?

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site nor the information or content contained therein. Often, links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Site.

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our Site, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

### Transfer of Data

We process personal information on leased dedicated servers located in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country. If you use the Owler Service from outside the United States and provide personal information to us, your personal information may be transferred to the United States. If you use the Owler Service from within the United States and provide personal information to us, your personal information may be transferred out of the United States. Through your use of our Service, you consent to such transfer and to the use of the information between countries.

### Your Consent

By using our Site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
