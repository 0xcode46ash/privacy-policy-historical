You may also be asked whether you would like to participate in surveys about O2 to help us improve our service. Whether you participate in these surveys or not will be up to you.

Purpose of collecting information  
If you are an O2 registered customer, we may use your personal information for the purposes of: (a) collecting payment from you (b) verifying that you are an authorised user if you call the O2 helpdesk (for reasons of security, you will be asked for some of the details you provided during the registration process) (c) informing you of: any service related changes affecting your use of O2; and new features and functionality (e.g. the introduction of a new messaging service) (d) contacting you to ask whether you are interested in using a new O2 offering (e) contacting you to ask whether you would like to attend a research group to help us improve our service to you (f) for crime and fraud detection and prevention.

If you choose to receive information from other companies, we may sometimes disclose your personal information to those companies. We will only do so where those companies have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy. Our policy will no longer apply.

Disclaimer 

The following conditions apply to anyone accessing and using the O2 Portals, or any part of them. O2 may modify these conditions from time to time and accordingly you are advised to keep up to date with the changes by regularly reviewing the conditions. By using the O2 Portals you agree to be bound by these conditions. 

The content available on the O2 Portals is for general entertainment and interest only and O2 does not warrant or guarantee its accuracy or completeness. It is your responsibility to judge the accuracy or completeness of the content before relying on it in any way. Your use of the content (for whatever purpose) is at your sole risk.

You are solely responsible for evaluating any goods (including software) or services offered by third parties via the O2 Portals or on the Internet. O2 will not be a party to or in any way responsible for any transactions between you and third parties. Any personal information you may wish to disclose to third parties is at your own risk. 

These conditions are governed by and will be interpreted in accordance with English Law and any disputes relating to these conditions will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

Acceptable Usage Policy 

For portals to operate in a manner that satisfies the majority of its users, all users need to observe some rules and etiquette governing their use of it. These requirements are usually contained or referred to in the relevant terms and conditions governing a particular Internet service as well as general law. 

O2's customers must ensure that they know what these requirements are and how they are affected by them. 

To enable its customers to have a better understanding of what is and is not acceptable when using the O2 Portals or our SMS and Chat services, and to help you get the best out of the O2 Portals, O2 has developed a number of Acceptable Usage Policies (AUPs) relating to our services. Complying with these AUPs should help you benefit from safer surfing and minimise the risk of suffering "online abuse". If you fail to do so, your service may be suspended or terminated. 

O2's AUPs are based on current "best industry practice" and draw on the collective experience of users and service providers across the Internet community. 

We may change the AUPs from time to time and any changes will be posted on these pages. To make the most of the guidance contained in the AUPs, please keep up to date with changes and look at them on a regular basis. We hope you will find them useful and informative.

Common Sense  
The majority of O2's online customers will be using commercial software to connect to and navigate. This software implements the technical aspects of the connection but there are also some simple common sense checks which all customers can implement. For example, making sure that the computer is dialing the whole number, including the area code, will reduce the possibility of other people receiving unwanted calls. 

O2's relationships with its customers, other networks, and ultimately its connectivity to the rest of the Internet, require its customers to behave responsibly. Accordingly, O2 cannot permit irresponsible behaviour by its customers, which could damage these relationships, O2's network or the use of the Internet by others. 

Customers who engage in abusive behaviour will be notified that their behaviour is unacceptable and may have their accounts suspended or terminated. Complying with these AUPs is a contractual requirement. If you fail to do so, your service may be suspended or terminated.

Legal Compliance  
The Internet and other portals are global mediums and are regulated by the laws of many different countries. Material which is illegal in this country may be legal in another, and vice versa. As a user in this country, for example, you should not access sites carrying child pornography, hard-core pornography or incitement to violence. These are just three examples of unlawful material and there are many others. When you visit a website, a copy of the visited pages is stored on your pc in the web browsers' cache files. Storage of illegal material in this way may well constitute a criminal offence. You must not, by using the O2 Portals, possess or transmit illegal material. If you are in any doubt as to the legality of anything, don't do it and take independent legal advice before proceeding. 

To connect to any of O2's internet portal services, you will use a telephone (PSTN) line, ISDN line or ADSL. While connected to the Internet, you must comply with legal requirements concerning telephone network (mis)use. Set out below is a self explanatory extract from the Telecommunications Act. As you can see, network misuse is a serious criminal offence that can lead to fines and/or imprisonment. 

(1) A Person who -  
(a) sends by means of a public communication system, a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, or  
(b) sends by those means, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, a message that he knows to be false or persistently makes use for that purpose of a public telecommunication system,  
shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine... or both. 

You must not gain or attempt to gain unauthorised access to any computer systems for any purpose, including accessing the Internet. As well as being in breach of your contract for the particular service, such hacking or attempted hacking is a criminal offence. 

Forging Addresses  
You must not send data via the Internet which has forged addresses or which is deliberately constructed to adversely affect remote machines. 

You must not configure your PC as an open relay system 

Message Service Usage Policy  
This Message Service Acceptable Usage Policy is based on current "best industry practice" and draws on the experience of users and providers of Message Services including email, instant message services, SMS messages and multi media services across the message services community. 

Exchanging communication with others generally involves using common sense regarding the content material and being polite and courteous. The vast majority of O2's customers understand what is appropriate when sending or receiving messages. Message Services are without doubt an extremely effective and convenient method of communication. They are fast and cheap and within seconds of sending a message, it will be with its recipient. 

Regrettably, there are occasions when individuals or groups of people exchange messages or involve in online activities, which are considered to be unacceptable by the Internet community. This is described by the generic term of "abuse". Although much unsolicited messages, particularly e-mail (SPAM), may just be a harmless but annoying way of advertising products or services, some can be as distressing as receiving malicious telephone calls. 

There are some simple steps you can take to minimise the likelihood of receiving or sending abuse or nuisance messages, particularly e-mail messages:  


  1. Ensure that you are running a good quality virus detection application. The majority of these applications have the ability to detect hackers as well as viruses. Hackers are people who try to hack into your computer to either cause mischief or find your passwords and usernames. You should be aware that some hackers have the ability to seriously damage your computer system. 
  2. If you keep sensitive information on your computer, it is worth using encryption software to protect it. 
  3. While connected, do not publicise your IP address. This is the unique ID that your ISP allocates you while you are connected to the Internet. This is especially important if you are using applications such as CHAT, IRC (Internet relay chat) or video conferencing using a directory service. 
  4. A majority of people spend their online time finding Internet software applications to run while online. Be careful what you install. Before installing software of unknown origin, ask yourself whether you trust the writer/source. Most computer viruses and Trojans are installed unknowingly while installing shareware or freeware applications that are supposedly designed to make your life easier. If in doubt, don't do it. 
  5. Don't give out your message address unless you are absolutely sure you can trust the recipient. You should treat your e-mail address and personal details if in a chat room, as you would treat your telephone number. 
  6. When posting into newsgroups configure your newsreader so that it doesn't show or it disguises your e-mail address, i.e. joe.bloggs32@nospam.isp.com. In the posting you would say" to reply to Joe, remove the nospam". A person responding to the e-mail then has to remove the nospam section of the e-mail address. This makes it more difficult for automated newsgroup trawlers to strip e-mail addresses from the postings. The majority of the mail lists that are used for the bulk sending of e-mails are compiled from undisguised e-mail addresses in newsgroups. 
  7. Avoid posting into newsgroups if you are not entirely sure about the nature of their subject matter. If you are going to post into these groups, be aware that there is very little your ISP can do to protect you if you become a victim of abusive e-mails resulting from your posting or a "flame war". 
  8. Never publicise your home address or telephone number. 
  9. Be very careful when sending details such as your credit card number by message. Unless you are completely sure you can trust the recipient and the details of the recipient's message system, don't do it. 
  10. When filling in online forms always look for and complete any "data protection opt out" boxes if you do not wish to be contacted regarding advertisement and promotion of any products and services. The information you provide may be disclosed to other organisations or used for marketing or other purposes which you did not envisage. If in doubt, do not use the online form. 

If you do become a victim of abusive e-mails, there is often very little your ISP can do to stop the abuse. However, the ISP of your abuser can possibly do something under its terms and conditions. Accordingly, we recommend you to take the following action:  
a. E-mail the "abuse department" for the individual's ISP.  
b. Send the relevant ISP as much evidence as possible. It is no use simply complaining about the activities of an individual, you must provide evidence of the abuse, e.g. send the whole e-mail, newsgroup posting or the URL of the website to abuse@ the ISP in question. The ISP will probably need the IP Address that the abuser was using at the time of the abuse. This is the unique ID allocated to that user at that specific moment and can be found/seen in the header of the e-mail, and in the header of the newsgroup posting. 

It is unlikely that a message service provider will simply give out the name and details of an alleged offender. However, a message service provider may need to divulge such information to appropriate authorities, such as the police or the courts, if formally requested to do so. In cases of extreme abuse, you may need to contact the police if you think further action should be taken. If you decide to do so, you must be prepared to provide the police with any evidence you have. The police will then consider whether a criminal offence may have been committed and whether further action can or should be taken. 

Spam or Unsolicited Communication  
You must not participate in the sending of unsolicited bulk e-mail, SMS messages, instant messages or multi media messages or usenet "abuse". This applies to material, which originates on your system or mobile device as well as third party material which passes through your system. 

Abusive Messages  
It is not always obvious whether an e-mail, SMS or other Message activity is innocent, inadvertent, or intentional but as a general rule users should be aware that what is unacceptable (and possibly illegal) offline (oral or written), applies equally to Message Services. As with telephone calls, you must not send any Message that causes annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety. You should not send false messages likely to cause distress (e.g. advising the recipient that a relative has been in an accident when they have not), or any other material which is distressing, grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing or in any other way unlawful. Particular care should be taken to avoid any material which is offensive to people on grounds of gender, race, colour, religion or other similar categorisation. Always be sensitive to the fact that children might have access. 

Security  
You must not share the password for any Message Service. Your passwords are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party. This is also important for your own protection. 

What action will O2 take?  
Compliance with this Acceptable Use Policy is a contractual requirement. If you fail to do so, your service may be suspended or terminated. 

Customers who engage in abusive behaviour will be notified that their behaviour is unacceptable and may have their accounts suspended or terminated if such behaviour continues 

Account Restoration  
A suspended account may be restored at O2's discretion, upon receipt of a written undertaking by the abuser not to commit any future "abuse". All cases are, however, considered by O2 on their individual merits. 

Port Scanning Policy  
O2 prohibits the use of port scanning software on its services. 

You must not run "port scanning" software, which accesses remote machines or networks, except with the explicit prior permission of the administrator or owner of such remote machines or networks. This includes using applications capable of scanning the ports of other Internet users. 

If you intend to run a port scanning application, you must provide O2 with a copy of the written consent received from the target of the scan authorising the activity. This must be supplied to O2 prior to the application being run. 

Q. What are ports?  
A. Basically a place where information goes into or out of a computer.  
With the Internet when your PC connects to a server it supplies a port number to be used for the server replies (the number will depend on the operating system used).  
* The Port needs to be open on the users machine in order to receive replies from the servers you are trying to communicate with. 

Q. What are trojans?  
A. Viruses - of which there are many different kinds. They act as a back door to your PC allowing potential hackers to access information on your computer. 

Q. What information are they after?  
A. Normally they are after User ID's and passwords for dial-up connections especially for 0800 access. 

Q. How are these viruses installed?  
A. They are normally installed by the user having downloaded an .EXE file onto their machine under false pretences via programs like ICQ or IRC for example. Running the file will implant the virus. 

Q. How can I protect my system from these viruses?  
A. By acquiring up to date anti-virus software for your system such as Nortons Anti-Virus or McAfee Virus Scan. 

Q. Where can I get further information about viruses?   
A. Further information can be acquired from the following web site <http://www.sophos.com/>

Q. How do the hackers access your system?  
A. Using software programs like Back Orifice or Subseven they scan a large range of IP addresses hoping to find a machine that has a trojan virus installed. 

Q. How can I stop myself from being port scanned?  
A. Unfortunately you cannot stop yourself from being port scanned however you can make sure they don't get any information from your machine. You would need to Download software which monitors your connection for such attempts - such as Jammer, Lockdown2000, Nukenabber (most of this software is free to download) These programs will warn you when an attack is taking place and also give the IP address of the person that is attacking you. 

Location Information  
Some web and mobile telephone services that you use from your O2 mobile may require us to disclose information about the location of your mobile phone to third parties. By using location based services such as 'Find My Nearest ATM' or 'Friend Finder', you consent to O2 disclosing your information to third parties required to provide you with the service. The information that we provide to third parties will be an approximate location only.

However if do not wish your location to be disclosed for some or all services, please call our Location Services Privacy Controller by dialling 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile (please see below for further details).
