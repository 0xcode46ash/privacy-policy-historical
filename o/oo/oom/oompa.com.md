In addition, as most Websites do, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Oompa.com. This information is compiled and analyzed on both an aggregated and personal basis. It may include what browser you are using, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, and which URL you go to next.

This helps us keep track of the number of visitors to our Website and allows us to determine the areas that are of the most interest to our visitors. 

    We may also use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and other tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. This information is used to gain a broader picture of usage patterns at our site. We may share the non-personally identifiable information gathered through use of cookies with our advertisers and/or business partners, in order to make the Websites as user-friendly as possible.
