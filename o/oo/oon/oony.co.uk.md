## Personal Data Compilation and Combination

The main purpose of the information compiled by OONY consists in offering users a friendly and efficient experience, customized to meet each user's preferences. OONY only compiles such information as may be necessary for the purposes of the service rendered, and it does not process such information in any way as may be in conflict with the purpose for which it was compiled or otherwise authorized by user. OONY compiles any personal information furnished by users during the sign-up process, including each user's name, e-mail address, postal address, gender, consumption preferences, etc. OONY may, from time to time, also compile information about users' use and preferences (for example, geographical location, images or objects selected by users' clicks on mails or Web Sites) to be used internally for research purposes and for service enhancement. OONY shall further be entitled to store information furnished by users upon users' express knowledge, as it is the case with users' answers on query forms, suggestions or e-mails sent to the Web Site. OONY may use such information for internal purposes, including but not limited to, streamlining the site and designing the service with respect to all its functionalities, adding new functionalities, etc. The information entered and compiled may be combined among all users to determine and objectify demographics for marketing & advertising purposes.

## Change of User Information

OONY provides users with the possibility of reviewing and modifying any information entered upon signing up for the Service. You may change your log-up information by accessing OONY's Web Site and selecting the "edit profile" option related to the information you intend to modify. As User, you are under a duty to keep your personal information up to date.

## Protection of Users' Personal Information

OONY's Web Site shall not share any personal information furnished by Users with any third parties outside this relation, unless it is to be done for any purposes requested by you and originally agreed upon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby expressly authorize OONY to share your personal information furnished by you:

  * Whenever required from us by statute or by means of court order.
  * With individuals or legal entities in which we trust in order for them to process such information in our name, based on our instructions, by virtue of this Privacy Policy, and pursuant to the relevant security and confidentiality measures.
  * With governmental organizations related to criminal investigations, prevention of fraud, or any other legal actions, or whenever OONY may deem it reasonably necessary to protect OONY, the Web Site, its users or the public at large.

## Use and Disclosure of the Information Gathered

All the information stored by OONY shall be deemed confidential, and therefore, it shall not be shared with any third parties outside the OONY-user relationship. OONY may share the results obtained from combining and adding all users' preferences for marketing & advertising purposes. If you do not agree to such use for any reason whatsoever, you may inform such situation by any of the applicable contact means, or you may also deregister from the service. Advertisers and any persons other than OONY's personnel shall not be given access to your personal information in any way that could lead such advertisers or persons to identify you by your use of the Service. Nevertheless, OONY shall undertake no obligation or liability in relation to such information as You may furnish, directly or indirectly, to any third parties. Any changes or modifications in your personal information shall be directly informed to OONY, because the information related to such changes, modifications or deletions shall not be exchanged. You shall be held accountable for the accuracy of the data furnished. OONY shall reserve its right to deregister from the services any and all users who may have furnished false information, notwithstanding any other legal actions as may be appropriate.

## Security

OONY undertakes to honor its obligation to keep all personal data private and to treat them as confidential, and to that effect, OONY shall be responsible for deploying all such technical, organizational, and security measures as may be necessary to avoid any alteration, loss, or treatment thereof, as well any non-authorized access to such information. However, considering the current technology conditions, we are not in a position to guarantee that non-authorized access shall never take place.
