# Privacy

O&O Software GmbH (O&O) respects and wishes to protect your privacy. This O&O data protection guarantee applies to the O&O websites and governs the compilation and use of data from all O&O websites worldwide. By using the O&O websites, you agree to the data practices described in this document.

This data protection guarantee consists of a general part which applies to all O&O websites and services, followed by site-specific passages which provide you with further information about the various O&O sites. Please read the complete O&O data protection guarantee below as well as further details about the protection of your personal data by O&O sites and services.

## Collection of your personal data

On some sites, O&O collects personal identifying information such as your email address, name, private and business addresses and telephone numbers. Data collected on O&O websites will be passed on within O&O, its subsidiaries and subcompanies. Personal and demographic data may be saved and processed outside your home country, including transfers within the Federal Republic of Germany. By using the O&O websites, you agree to all such transfers outside your home country.

Data concerning your computer hardware and software will be automatically collected by O&O and might be passed on to other websites within the O&O website group. This data can include the following: your IP address, browser type, domain name, access type and relevant web addresses. This data will be used by O&O for maintenance purposes, to guarantee quality and to produce general statistics about the use of its websites.

O&O recommends that you read the data protection guarantees of websites reachable by links from O&O in order that you understand how these websites collect, use and distribute data. O&O is not responsible for the content and data protection guarantees of websites outside the O&O websites.

## Use of your personal data

O&O websites and service partners collect your personal data and use the information for the maintenance of the O&O websites and also to carry out the services you ask for. O&O websites also use your identifying data to let you know about products and services which are available from O&O. O&O might also ask for your opinion on current product and services and potential new products and services.

O&O does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. O&O may contact you from to time to time on behalf of external business partners in order to draw your attention to special offers that might interest you. In such cases, your personal identifying data (email address, name, postal address, telephone number) will not be passed on to third parties. Additionally, O&O might pass on data to trusted partners who help us carry out statistical analysis, send you an email or message by post, offer customer support, or arrange a delivery. These third parties are forbidden from using your personal information for any other purpose apart from these services from O&O, and they must also treat your data confidentially.

O&O does not use any sensitive personal data such as religion, ethnic origin or political affiliation, and does not pass on this information without your express permission.

O&O observes websites and pages within O&O that are visited by our customers in order to determine the most popular parts of our websites. This data is used in order to adapt web content for customers whose behavior suggests that they are interested in a particular area.

O&O will only pass on personal data without notice when this is necessary for legal reasons or that it is reasonable to assume that such steps are necessary. The following are conditions for this: (a) when it is necessary for conformity to legal restrictions on O&O or the website; (b) for the protection and defense of the rights or property of O&O; (c) for the protection of the personal security of the users of O&O, O&O websites or of the public.

O&O follows websites and pages visited by our customers within O&O with help from Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc. (“Google”). This helps us ascertain which O&O sites and services are the most popular. This data is then used to adapt content to suit users whose behavior indicates an interest in a certain area. Google Analytics uses so-called “Cookies”, text files that are saved to your computer and which analyze website usage. The information compiled by the Cookie about your use of the website (including your IP Address) is transferred to a Google Server in the USA and saved there. Google will use this information to evaluate your usage, and to compile reports on your website activity for the site operator as well as for website and internet usage of related service providers. Google will also pass this information onto third parties when legally required to, or where the third party concerned has been instructed to process the data on Google’s behalf. Google will under no circumstances bring your IP Address into contact with other Google data. You can prevent installation of Cookies using the appropriate settings in your browser software; we would simply point out that by doing so you are unable to enjoy the full range of functions offered by this website. By using this website, you declare yourself to be in agreement with Google handling the data obtained about you by means of the methods described above.

## Use of Cookies

Many O&O websites use “cookies” to help you personalize the website. A cookie is a text file which is copied from a web server onto your hard disk. Cookies are expressedly given to you and can be read only by a web server in the same domain as the one that gave you the cookie.

The primary function of cookies is as a time-saving feature. The function of a cookie is to let the web server know that you are returning to the site; for example, if you personalize an O&O website or register yourself for O&O website or services, a cookie helps O&O to call up your specific information for later visits. This simplifies the recording of your personal information such as billing address, delivery address, and so on. If you return to the same O&O website, the previously recorded data can be called up again so you can easily use the O&O features relevant to yourself.

You can accept or decline cookies. The majority of web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings and decline them. If you decline cookies you may not be able to use all the features of O&O services or the websites you visit.

## Use of Facebook Plug-ins

These internet pages use Plug-Ins from the social network facebook.com. These Plug-Ins are operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”).

If you access our internet presence through internet sites containing such Plug-Ins, a connection to the Facebook Servers is made. Your Browser is informed and the Plug-In is executed on the internet site. This is how the Facebook servers are informed which of our internet pages you have visited. If you are logged in as a member of Facebook at this time, Facebook assigns this information to your personal Facebook account. When using the Plug-In functions (such as clicking on the “Like” button, or entering a comment) this information is also assigned to your Facebook account, which you can only avoid by logging out of Facebook before using the Plug-Ins.

Further information on the collection and use of data by Facebook, and about your rights in this respect and how to protect your privacy, can be found in the privacy pages of Facebook.

## Security of your personal data

O&O protects your personal data from unauthorized access, use and distribution. O&O secures the personal identifying data which you make available to the server to prevent unauthorized access, use and distribution. If personal data, for example a credit card number, are transferred to other websites, these data are protected by the use of encoding e.g. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

## Changes to this document

O&O will occasionally update this data protection guarantee in order to take account of feedback from firms and customers. O&O recommends that you regularly check this document so that you are kept informed of O&O’s data protection.
