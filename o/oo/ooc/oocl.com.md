**Last Updated: 24 May 2002**

This Privacy and Security Statement applies to this website which is owned and operated by Orient Overseas Container Line Limited ("OOCL") under the domain name [www.OOCL.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627121427id_/http%3A//www.oocl.com/default.htm) ("OOCL Website" or "Website).

As part of the normal operation of our services we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. OOCL understands and appreciates that you, as an OOCL Website and/or Service user, are concerned about your privacy and about the confidentiality and security of information we may collect from you online. OOCL is committed to safe guarding your privacy. This OOCL Privacy and Security Statement explains how information collected from you will be treated as you access and interact with the OOCL Website.

In addition to the provisions of this Privacy and Security Statement, there may also be specific and additional privacy provisions, which apply to certain sections of the OOCL Website. As those specific and additional provisions also relate to your privacy protection, you should review them wherever they are accessible by you on the OOCL Website. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy and Security Statement and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail.

1\. Acceptance and changes to Privacy and Security Statement

As the OOCL Website develops and as technology evolves, OOCL will continue to strive to provide you with better and more customized services and with a more effective web site. OOCL may at any time revise the Privacy and Security Statement by publishing the revised Privacy and Security Statement on the OOCL Website. You accept that by doing this, OOCL has provided you with sufficient notice of the changes.

2\. Information We Collect

We collect information from you in order to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized service while enjoying services provided by OOCL.

OOCL may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our Websites.

An exception is where you access a Third Party Website from the OOCL Website. In that case, information generated by cookies and information about your preferences or other information that you provide about yourself may be shared between that third party, the person hosting the Third Party Website, OOCL and/or its Affiliates. OOCL uses the information to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. It may also be used for the enhancement of services offered through the OOCL Website and Third Party Websites.

Except as otherwise expressly discussed herein, this Privacy and Security Statement only addresses the use and disclosure in first instance of information we collect from you. Personally identifiable information about you provided by another party will for purposes of this Privacy and Security Statement be deemed to be personally identifiable information collected from such other party, not you, whether such other party originally received the information from you, OOCL or another source.

6\. How we handle E-mails

We will preserve the content of any e-mail that you send us, if we believe that we have a legal requirement to do so. Any personally identifiable information contained in your e-mail, including your e-mail address, will be used or disclosed in ways set out in this Privacy and Security Statement. Your e-mail message content may be monitored by OOCL's employees for trouble shooting and maintenance purposes or where e-mail abuse is suspected.

7\. Choice/Opt-out

You have the right to request OOCL not to use or retain personally identifiable information collected from you. However, we may retain in our files some information you have requested to be removed in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and/or enforce the Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information would be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

8\. Reviewing and Changing your Personally Identifiable Information

You can review and change the information you submitted including but not limited to the following:

(i) Your Password and email address. If you change your Password, OOCL keeps track of your old Password and your new Password.

(iii) Your shipping preferences and preferred time zone

You must promptly update us of any changes to your information.

9\. Security of Information

OOCL takes reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookies which it has placed and personally identifiable information that it has collected in accordance with this Privacy and Security Statement. OOCL will use standard industry efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and secure socket layers. You acknowledge that notwithstanding the steps OOCL takes to ensure security, there can be no guarantee of security on the internet and that the risk of interception of and tampering with any communication in relation to the OOCL Website is your own.

10\. Important Reminders

This is to remind you that in the Terms of Use you have provided OOCL with all such necessary consents, licenses, permits and authorizations as may be required by any applicable law or otherwise (including all privacy and other data protection regulations and legislation) as shall be necessary for the transfer of personal data to OOCL, its Affiliates and/or third parties wherever they may be situated, and for the use and processing of such data by OOCL, its Affiliates and/or third parties.

Also note that under Section 6.03 of the Terms of Use you are responsible for the security of your password and you may not disclose your password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if the security of your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.

OOCL will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of your OOCL account in the correct manner and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personally identifiable information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

Once OOCL receives data transmitted by you, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems. We remind you that different means exist and are being developed for deployment in the context of the Internet which will enable you to improve the protection of your data. Therefore, we encourage you to use all available means to protect your data and communications such as access codes to your own personal computer.

We also remind you that you may be legally responsible for the processing of data, for example, if you illicitly upload or download and that everything may be traced back to you even if you use a pseudonym.
