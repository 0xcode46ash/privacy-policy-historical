We strive to make the most of every users visit to our Web Site. To provide our users with goods and

we may ask you for additional personal information if you want to access your assigned account(s)

or with the requested goods and/or services. In some instances, we may need to supplement the

We will maintain information about you, your assigned account, online account activity, online goods
and/or services requested and your usage of our Web Site to help us administer your online account
needs and to continually improve your online experience by providing you with customized, relevant

Choices.
How We Use The Information We Collect
Whether you are a new Web Site user or a longtime customer, we use personal information collected on
our Web Site to better understand how our customers use the Web Site and the various features
thereof, as well as to help us fit offerings to you as a customer, to conduct market research and to
handle the transactions you initiate. In some instances, we may share your contact information with
carefully selected companies to assist us in processing your online transactions or to deliver the goods
and/or services you request online. We may also share your personal information with carefully selected
non-affiliated companies who provide transactional services or send information to you on our behalf.
In an effort to ensure that you get the most out of your visits to our Web Site, we may use your personal
information in combination with other information we have collected about you as our customer and
information provided to us by third parties to present you with customized and relevant information

Tracking Activity On Our Web Site
In order to make your visit to our Web Site as productive as possible, we track Web Site activity
information such as navigational or technical information through the use of cookies, log files, text


strings, browser setting and/or other tracking technology. However, we want you to know that the
tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. Such technology
cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture any personal
information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. We only know
who you are if you tell us. You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as name,
address, phone number or email address to us when you register for online goods and/or services.
Cookies: One way we track activity is by using cookies. A "cookie" is an electronic file that holds small
strings of text. When you visit our Web Site, we send a cookie to your browser so that we can recognize
it when you or another user of your computer return to our Web Site. We want to recognize your
browser so we can make the best use of your time when visiting our Web Site. For example, when you
visit our Web Site, we present an introductory page to all new users. The fact that you have already
visited the introductory page is recorded in a cookie so you won't see the introductory page again. For
your security, if you are registered for online services and/or have an account with us, we cannot give
you access to your account information on our Web Site unless your browser is set to accept cookies
from us.
Advertising: When you visit our Web Site by clicking on certain banner ads or special offers on our
partners' web site, we track this information to improve navigation and deliver relevant information
when you arrive at our Web Site. We also do this because we want to determine if our ads and special
offers are appealing to our users. In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie
may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our third-
party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to
learn which ads we place on third-party sites bring users to our Web Site. They do not capture or convey
any personal or sensitive information about you.
Browser settings: You can adjust many browser preferences so that you are alerted when a cookie is
placed in your browser, or adjust preferences to decline cookies altogether. Recognize that cookies
enable you to visit our Web Site without reviewing introductory information. In addition to allowing us
to recognize you, cookies also enable us to securely provide our registered users with account
information.
How We Use Your Email Address
We recognize that email can be the preferred mode of communication for some of our Web Site users. If
you provide us with your email address when registering for an online service or product or when
accessing your account online, we will use it to contact you about online goods and/or services for
which you have registered or about your account.
We may use your email address to send you the following types of email messages:
        Service notifications related to your accounts(s)
        Products or services information
        Promotional offers or updates about our goods and/or services


        Email newsletters related to us and our business activities
We do not share your email address with non-affiliated companies for them to market their products or
services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected non-affiliated companies to offer
certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you.
Ads That Link To Our Web Site
We may use third parties to place banner ads on other Web Sites and will perform tracking and
reporting activities through use of ad servers. We do not provide ad servers with your personal
information and ad servers do not collect your personal information.
Ad servers are subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about the
privacy policies of these ad servers including information on how to opt-out of their tracking methods,
please click here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative web site.
How We Safeguard Your Information
We realize how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the
protection of personal or confidential information sent to, or from us over the Internet.
First, we require that a "secure session" be established. This is done any time you supply or access
personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas. This technology creates a private
conversation that only your computer and our systems can understand, helping to ensure that the
transmitted information remains confidential. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your
browser support 128-bit encryption.
Second, many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security
measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby
allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access.
Third, in order to bring you the many online goods and/or services offered through our Web Sites, we
work with carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share any information
with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we first conduct a careful
evaluation of their information and security systems and practices, and require administrative, technical,
and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of your customer information. At any
time, we may audit these companies to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.
Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from our Web Site or an email from
us may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Policy. To ensure your
privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy policy of other Internet sites you visit.
When you have finished using a secure area of our Web Site, make sure you always click on the "Log
Out" link which appears on the top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure
transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. This also helps prevent
unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from your computer.


You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some
pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your
"Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the
security of your confidential user ID or password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your
account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of
anyone else viewing your confidential information.
We may, in exceptionally rare cases, be required and therefore reserves the right to share your
information in response to duly authorized informational requests from governmental authorities or
where required by law.

We provide users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email communications from us at any
time. If for any reason you would like to unsubscribe from our communications, please follow the
