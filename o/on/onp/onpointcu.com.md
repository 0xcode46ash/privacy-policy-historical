Our Privacy Pledge.
At OnPoint Community Credit Union, we respect the

protect the nonpublic personal and financial information
that you have entrusted to us. This notice describes the
privacy policy and practices followed by the Credit Union
and our affiliate, OnPoint Service Group, LLC.
Member Information We Collect. OnPoint collects only
relevant member information as the law allows or requires
us to collect in order to establish and maintain your account
and services. We may collect personal information about
you which is “nonpublic.” The nonpublic personal information
we collect varies depending on the accounts and services
you request and use. We collect information about you
from the following sources:
  Application Information. We retain personal information
  we receive from you on any application you provide for
  a deposit account, EFT service, ATM Cards and Visa
  Debit Cards, Visa Credit Cards, consumer and real estate
  loans. Application information includes: name, address,
  social security number, and credit history.

  Credit Reports. When we evaluate your application for an
  account or service, we may request a credit report about you
  from a consumer reporting agency. We retain the personal
  and credit history information about you, and we may use it
  to evaluate future account service requests.
  Online. We obtain information online when you visit
  our website, www.onpointcu.com. This includes but is
  not limited to retaining information you provide us on
  any online application, Online Banking transaction
  or information you send to us by email to assist us in
  providing a better online experience to our members.
Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards. We
maintain strict policies and security controls to assure
that your nonpublic personal information in our computer
systems and files is protected.
  Employee Access. Credit Union employees do have
  access to your information in order to provide service
  to you. However, our employees’ access is restricted to
  their need to know such information or as necessary to
  conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries. All
  employees are trained to respect member privacy. No
  one except our employees has access to the OnPoint
  computer system and records storage.
  Security Safeguards. OnPoint has established security
  controls and procedures to safeguard the information
  you provide us and the information we collect about you.
  Any information exchanged between OnPoint and our
  membership via the Internet relies on industry standard
  128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. If we ask
  you for information other than your name, address, email
  address, and phone number via the Internet, it will be
  obtained using 128-bit SSL encryption.
  Electronic mail by itself is generally not a secure
  method of communication. Email correspondence is not
  encrypted.
  Cookies. We also use cookies to provide additional
  security during home banking sessions. A cookie is a piece
  of information that our web server stores on your computer
  hard drive and retrieves later during your session or future
  sessions. A cookie may contain the following information,
  encrypted for protection: globally unique identifier, name,
  account number, home phone, work phone and email
  address. We use “strong” encryption (128 bit key length
                                                             2


   or higher) to protect the data within this cookie and we
   change the encryption keys regularly. This secure cookie
   is created when you log in. The cookie is time sensitive
   and will expire after a prescribed period. Once expired, the
   cookie is no longer usable. We use these cookies to verify
   your identity, to protect against unauthorized access, and to
   enhance your online experience.
Our Sharing of Member Information. In order to provide
financial services to you, we share certain information
about you with our affiliates and third party service
providers. However, we limit any information sharing to
the extent necessary to service your account. If we share
your information, it is with the goal of bringing you
quality services, more choices, and greater convenience.

generally only shared or disclosed if required to enforce or
administer an account or as required by law.
