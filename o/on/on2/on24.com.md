**Security of Your Personal Information**  
ON24 has implemented processes in an attempt to protect your personal information from misuse. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where ON24, its subsidiaries, or its third party service providers are located.

**Control of Your Password(s)**  
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any. Therefore, we recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.

**Protection of Children’s Personal Information**  
ON24 does not publish content that is targeted at children.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**  
We and our third party service providers use “cookies” and other tracking technologies on our website. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall personal information previously indicated by a web user. Currently, our website does not automatically recognize browser requests not to be tracked. Most browsers, however, allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our website is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and your web experience. We, and our third party service providers, may also analyze information for trends and statistics. 

**Safe Harbor**  
ON24 complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit ON24’s website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with ON24, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

**Security**  
Wherever your personal information may be held within ON24 or on its behalf, we take reasonable steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure, including, without limitation, restricting access to certain portions of our website through access controls, and using firewalls. Regardless of the precautions taken by us, ON24 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. 

**Access**  
To the extent that you do provide us with personal information, ON24 wishes to maintain accurate personal information. Where we collect personal information from you on the web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting ON24 should you need to update or correct that information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your personal information to [privacy@on24.com](mailto:privacy@on24.com) and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your personal information that we hold as soon as practicable.
