**Use of Cookies**

UNV ‘s Online Volunteering service uses “cookies” to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. 

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline all cookies, if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you chose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Site.

**Updating Your Information**

All Registered Users can correct, update or change their account profile at any time from the Member Profile page accessible from the MyOV area of the site.

UNV ‘s Online Volunteering service has implemented reasonable technical and organization measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.

We attempt to limit access to your personal information to relevant Registered Users, but we cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to it. For example, Users may have retained a copy of your information in their own file system or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this information in these instances.
