These sites have standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We cannot be 100% sure that nobody can hack into our server, so BlueSparks recommends using a free e-mail service, such as hotmail, when submitting your e-mail address to sites on the Internet.
