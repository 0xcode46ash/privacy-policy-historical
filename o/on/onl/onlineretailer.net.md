# Privacy Policy | National Media

National Media and its related companies have a firm commitment to privacy in accordance with the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000, which took effect in December 2001. This privacy policy covers all personal information that we hold.

**Collection of Information**

From time to time we may invite you to supply personal information in order for us to authenticate your identity or to provide you with products or services (such as access to our registration and purchasing services, email newsletters and offers). In order to deliver such services, we will need to process and store your personal information and may need to transfer it to our relevant partner(s). By submitting your personal information, you consent to such processing and transfers in connection with such services and for any other purposes to which you consent at the time you provide the information, or as provided in this Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and security of your personal information.

Whenever we collect personal information from you we will do so in a lawful and fair way. We will also advise you how and where to contact us. If we collect the information from a third party we will take reasonable steps to advise you of that collection promptly. We will tell you why we are collecting the information and the third parties to whom we usually disclose that information. If you do not wish to provide the information we request, we will tell you what impact this will have.

**Disclosing Information**

We will only disclose personal information in accordance with the Act. This means that it will be disclosed if:

  * we told you when collecting it that it would be disclosed for that purpose or for a related purpose that you would reasonably expect;
  * we have your consent;
  * it is part of business assets which we are selling;
  * we are required by law to disclose it; or
  * it is otherwise permitted under the Act



**Opt Out**

We will provide you with a low cost way of contacting us if you wish to opt out from receiving further marketing offers. In accordance with the Act, direct marketing offers will contain an opportunity to opt out.

**Quality of Information**

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date.

**Security**

We are committed to protecting your privacy and will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we collect is protected from loss and misuse and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.

**Access to Information**

You can access your personal information upon request. However, there are occasions when this access may be denied under the exemptions contained in the Act.

**Availability of Policy**

This policy is available upon request. It will be reviewed from time to time and any amendments will be included in the updated policy.
