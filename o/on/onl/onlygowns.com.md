This privacy policy is valid for all users of this website.

We do not pass or disclose your private information to third party, unless subject to law or in connection with a legal claim or proceeding. However, if OnlyGowns is acquired by another entity, information pertaining to the clients of OnlyGowns may be made available to the new entity.

**Security**

OnlyGowns keeps a tab or a check on every fraudulent means of getting information by implementing appropriate security measures. When users submit sensitive information via website, the information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form ask user to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number /or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. In spite of all possible ways and means to protect your valuable data, it is to be noted that no internet data transmission is guaranteed to be full-proof or secure from access by unintended intruders, hence we should not be held responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence.
