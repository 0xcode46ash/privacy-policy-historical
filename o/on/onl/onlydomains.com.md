## WHOIS Policy

The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. The purpose of the WHOIS service is to allow users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. The WHOIS service is provided by the registry via a web-based tool and Port 43.

  * **Collection of WHOIS Data**
    * Data about each domain name registration is collected from the registrant by the registrar, and submitted to the registry in accordance with the procedural requirements of the registry. The WHOIS service displays a subset of the full registry data for each domain name (known as the "WHOIS data").
    * Under the Registrar Agreement, and in accordance with New Zealand privacy legislation, registrars must inform registrants of the fact that some of their personal information will be disclosed on the WHOIS service. Under the domain name licence agreement, registrants grant to the registry the right to disclose information for the purposes of maintaining the WHOIS service.
    * The WHOIS data that is collected by registrars at the time of registration is highly accurate and reliable. However, the integrity of the WHOIS database is undermined if the data is not kept up-to-date.
    * In order to maintain the integrity of the WHOIS database, registrants are required to notify their registrar of any changes to WHOIS data for their domain name(s) and the registrar must update the WHOIS database on receipt of new information from the registrant.
  * **Use of WHOIS Data**  
In the interests of protecting the privacy of registrants, the following activities are strictly prohibited:   

    * use of WHOIS data to allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited communications to any person, by any means;
    * use of WHOIS data to support an automated electronic query process; and
    * bulk access to WHOIS data (ie. where a user is able to access WHOIS data other than by sending individual queries to the database).
