How We Collect Information

The FreeHandMusic site collects personally identifying information when customers:

>  2\. provide content suggestions or send queries to FreeHandMusic employees  
>  3\. enter drawings, sweepstakes, contests or sign-up for FreeHandMusic's e-mail newsletter

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of the FreeHandMusic.com site. However, you will not have access to areas and products that require personal identification.

When you register or order online, FreeHandMusic collects your name, mailing address, User IDs, Usernames and passwords.

When you make a purchase using your credit card we pass your credit card number through secure payment gateways for verification and processing. We do not store your credit card number or expiration date.

We respect your right to privacy and have implemented this Privacy Policy in recognition of the importance of using in a responsible way the information you choose to provide us.

How We Use The Information We Collect

We use the information to help us improve our communications with you so you receive more of what you want and less of what you don't want.

We use credit card information to process orders; never for marketing purposes.

We use information received from drawings, contests and sweepstakes to administer these promotions. We also use this information to let you know about our products and services.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, or unless your prior permission is obtained, FreeHandMusic does not share with third parties personally identifying information collected from the distribution of FreeHandMusic products or gathered on the FreeHandMusic website, except that FreeHandMusic may share such information with third parties who are the developer, owner or licensor of the product or service in question.

About IP Addresses

FreeHandMusic collects IP addresses to help with its system administration.

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're connected to the Internet. Web servers – the big computers that "serve" up Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

When customers request pages from FreeHandMusic.com, our servers log the customers' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.

FreeHandMusic does not use cookies:

  * to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie
