* * *

  * Our site contains unique features developed especially to preserve and enhance User privacy. Registered Users have the option to communicate by using our O-mail system. O-mail is onsite communication that works much like email, but it allows Users to communicate without revealing personally identifiable information such as their name or email address. Users may display or offer their email address or other personal contact information onsite, at their own discretion. Personally identifiable User information is not published or offered in any way to third parties. User privacy is a key concern in the continuing development of OnlineAuction.com.
