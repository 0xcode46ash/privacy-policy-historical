## Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for Use of OnlineBestColleges.com (Effective Date 1/5/2016)

Welcome and thank you for accessing OnlineBestColleges.com’s services and content. Please read on to find out how we accumulate and use information to provide users with content and related products and services, and note that by using our site, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The two types of data we collect are submitted information and automatic information. Submitted information is that which users voluntarily submit through our web form and consists of personal contact information and any other details that can help us match users to an education product or service. To ensure users receive the most relevant information about education-related services, schools and programs, we collect, store, and share submitted information with schools and other third parties.

When you submit this data, you are giving OnlineBestColleges.com and our affiliated schools and partners permission to contact you, in accordance with all applicable laws, about education opportunities or related topics. If you do not wish to receive any email communications from school, a third party, or us, you may unsubscribe through a link in the email, which will halt further mailings from that sender.

Automatic information is the other type of data that OnlineBestColleges.com collects, and includes certain types of anonymous information we receive whenever you utilize our site. We use this information to enhance the site and create individualized user experiences. We also use “cookies” to collect anonymous data for analytics, site optimization, and for tailored advertising and marketing purposes. This type of data includes your IP address, as well as your browser and operating system versions.

In addition, you agree and acknowledge that we preserve the right to release any collected information — including personal data — to businesses providing our organization with administration services, i.e. an email delivery service. You also give us, our vendors, partners, and affiliates the right to contact you for a period of time and relinquish any rights the Do Not Call list or other applicable law grants you. Your submission may exempt us from other applicable laws and serves as an omission to Do Not Call requirements established by state and federal governments.

We reserve the right to release your personal information in certain legal instances, such as by a subpoena or other legal procedure we deem necessary to protect our rights, ensure the safety of you and others, determine alleged fraud, respond to a government or legal request, and/or in the instance that OnlineBestColleges.com merges, acquisitions, or sells some or all of its assets.

_It the event that we change our practices, it is possible t we will revise our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in the future, so we suggest you reread this document periodically to remain up to date on our practices concerning your privacy and other important information._
