computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data: other information, including IP address and standard web log information;

**Order**

We DO NOT sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your permission. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user should provide contact information (like name and e-mail) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date etc.).

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We have a secure ordering process provided by Eplastic. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software available in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order and order confirmation forms, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing' (in non-secure mode).
