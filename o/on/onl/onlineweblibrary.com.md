When specifically requested by the user, we use customer contact information from registration forms to send the user information about our company and services. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Any user may cancel or opt-out of any service or future mailing; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.

Demographic and profile data is collected at our site. We use this data to strategize and prioritize the development of new products and services. From time to time, this information may be shared with advertisers and other parties -- but only an overall, non-identifying, aggregate basis.
