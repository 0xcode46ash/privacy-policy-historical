# SFI Affiliate Program

 

 

Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. Also, please remember that no computer system should be considered safe from intrusion. E-mail may pass through many computer systems, and should not be considered a secure means of communication unless encrypted. Even then, information is only as secure as the encryption method. Therefore, although we take many precautions to protect our system and our servers, we cannot guarantee the security of any data on any server, including "secure servers."

**Affiliate Information** ** ** ****

Affiliate information is information such as name, address, telephone number, email address and SFI ID number -- information that identifies a particular individual or business. Imad hamdan, president of Corporate Webworks (CWW), and SFI Executive Group Leader ID 81940 collects and stores affiliate information in the following ways: 

As part of an affiliate’s registration with SFI within Imad Hamdan’s executive group, affiliates  provide their name, address, company name (if applicable) and email address information. SFI in turn provides Imad hamdan /CWW with this information in a form of email notifications and by listing some of this information on its password protected website --powerline genealogy section. CWW retains this information in its affiliate databases.

**How We Use** **Affiliate** **Information**

 The affiliate information that we collect during SFI’s notification process and SFI group related business is or may be used:

  * For affiliate communication purposes;

  * To examine affiliate status and progress;

  * To make sure that only SFI affiliates within or related to our group are able to access certain affiliate-only areas on our [_www.e-mastersteam.com_](http://www.e-mastersteam.com/), [_www.uniqueisp.com_](http://www.uniqueisp.com/) and/or [_www.mlmopportunity.net_](http://www.mlmopportunity.net/) and affiliated websites;

  * To inform affiliates with certain updates and other SFI business and related areas.




This information is kept on limited access computers and is only available to those employees who have a need to know.

  * With prior affiliate’s authorization, we provide some information to companies that we use  to perform certain functions for us -- for example, name, address, email address, website address and other needed information are provided to advertising companies, for affiliate’s business advertising purposes.

  * Frequently, we use our Affiliate database to distribute SFI team newsletters, updates or important notices to our affiliates.

  * CWW  may also use affiliate information to enforce our Appropriate Use Policy, but only to the extent necessary.

  * We will share affiliate information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so, and may cooperate with these authorities investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal transfer or use of copyrighted material, or postings or e-mail containing threats of violence. Except under the limited circumstances described above, we do not disclose Affiliate information to third parties.




**Voluntary Affiliate Surveys, Follow-ups and Thank You Notes**

 We periodically conduct both business and individual affiliate surveys. We encourage all of our affiliates to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Pease remember that your participation in our affiliate surveys is voluntary.

Follow-ups and Thank You Notes are mailed periodically to new Affiliates who have joined our SFI powerline team.
