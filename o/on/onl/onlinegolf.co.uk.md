In addition to the information collected as described above, technology is used to collect anonymous information about the use of this Web Site. For example, technology may be used to track which pages of this Web Site visitors view. Technology may also be used to determine which Web browsers visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables the compilation of statistics about Web Site visitors and their use of this Web Site.

This Web Site contains hyperlinks to other pages on this Web Site. Technology may be used to track how often these links are used and which pages on this Web Site visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally â€“ it simply enables the compilation of statistics about the use of these hyperlinks.

Such anonymous data is used to improve the content and functionality of this Web Site and e-mail updates, to better understand clients and markets, and to improve services.

#### Cookies and IP address

In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, in the future temporary "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is "john@bigmail.com," the cookie collects the "bigmail.com" portion of your e-mail address) and the date and time you accessed this Web Site may be used. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not.

IP address may also be used to help diagnose problems with this Web Site's server and to administer this Web Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many visitors are from outside of the UK.

Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants, legal advisors and other companies (collectively, "agents"). They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purposes than that which is contractually agreed. Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, that third party is contractually required to take adequate precautions to protect that data and maintain confidentiality. Information about you may also be received from other sources (such as demographic information and purchase history) and it may be added to records about you in order to make marketing efforts more efficient.
  * The information in this Web Site's databases may be shared or transferred to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of the databases or this Web Site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution or similar event.
  * Where you have consented, your information may be disclosed to partners or other businesses who may contact you about their products or services that may interest you.
  * During the purchase process, your information may be shared with certain intermediaries (e.g. UPS) strictly to process and ship your order.



#### Data integrity and security

Personal Data in this Web Site's databases are maintained to a high standard of reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency and to protect the privacy and security of the databases. Personal Data will be kept only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.

Employees and third parties who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle such data properly and in accordance with security protocols and strict standards of confidentiality. Although loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction of data cannot be guaranteed, such unfortunate occurrences are prevented as far as reasonably possible.

Security measures protect you while you shop on this Web Site so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. This Web Site's servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that no other party can read a buyer's personal information. Only the last five digits of your credit card number will be revealed when you are sent an order confirmation. However, the entire credit card number will be transmitted to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

#### Gift certificates

If you purchase a gift certificate on this Web Site, you will be asked to provide the recipient's name and e-mail address. The recipient information you provide will only be used to deliver the gift certificate and for no other purpose.

This Web Site may contain hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party web sites or any association with their operators. Such web sites are controlled by third parties and as such you should review any privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any Personal Data about yourself. The information practices of those websites linking from or to this Web Site are not covered by this Policy, and you are encouraged to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others.

Requests to delete Personal Data are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations.

You may ask to have your account information removed from this Web Site's active databases; however, because this Web Site tracks past purchases, information associated with past purchases can not be deleted. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity. Also, as a security measure the data stored on this Web Site's systems is "backed-up", and such prior information cannot be completely removed from the databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Data will be completely removed from the databases in response to your requests. However, please be aware that your personally identifiable information will be kept only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
