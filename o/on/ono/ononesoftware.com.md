## Privacy Policy

#### Your Information

onOne Software's privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by onOne Software anytime you interact with onOne Software such as when you purchase an onOne Software product, contact a technical support or sales associate, sign up for an e-newsletter or request a download of demonstration software.

We collect your personal information because it assists us in delivering a high level of customer service. For example, your personal information helps us to keep you informed and up-to-date on the latest product updates and announcements as well as special offers that may be extended from time to time.

When you provide onOne Software with your name, email address, mailing address or telephone number, and you do not "opt-out", onOne Software and onOne Software representatives and authorized affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information, new products and other onOne Software information. Other than onOne Software representatives and authorized affiliates (such as value-added resellers), onOne Software does not offer, sell, or otherwise make available any user-provided information to third parties.

onOne Software will send notifications regarding product updates and technical support notices. These messages are deemed essential to the functionality of your product and as such, there is no "opt-out" available for update notifications.

If you do not want onOne Software or onOne Software representatives to contact you, you may "opt-out" at any time. You may "opt-out" by contacting onOne Software's Customer Service Department or by following the instructions included in the email correspondence.

You may be asked to provide personal information in order to quality for this contest or promotion.
