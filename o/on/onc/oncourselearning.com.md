# OnCourse Learning - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

This policy was last modified on 7/15/2015

We know your privacy is important and that is why OnCourse Learning is dedicated to making it one of our top priorities. OnCourse Learning Corporation (“ **OCL** ”) created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and confidentiality. This is our main privacy policy for [OnCourseLearning.com](https://web.archive.org/Home.aspx) and other policies may apply to your privacy when visiting one of our other sites. Additionally, we may provide external links to third party websites who may have their own privacy policies. We recommend that you read through this policy and any other privacy policy if your private information is a concern.

####  Our simple policy

Since reading a bunch of legal jargon is something that most people try to avoid, we want to provide our customers and visitors the basics of our privacy policy. We wrote it in a way that is easy to read and understand.

####  What information do we collect?

We collect information from you when you fill out our [“contact us”](https://web.archive.org/Contact-Us.aspx) form on our site. All you do is provide your name, email, phone number, company name, and a short message. Just enough information for us to give you the best customer service we can. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

####  What do we use your information for?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To improve our website. We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you. Thanks again for all the feedback!
  * To improve customer service. Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs. You are welcome!



Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever. That’s a short and simple promise.  
 

####  How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you contact us. It involves firewalls, safes with complicated locks, robots, lasers, and trained customer service agents.

####  Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.

####  Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

####  Third party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

####  California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

####  Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act); we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

####  Online Privacy Policy Only

This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through OCL’s website and not to information collected offline, subsidiary websites, and third party websites.

####  Changes to our Privacy Policy

OCL strives to always offer the best possible products and services to our customers; therefore, we will likely have to update this privacy policy from time to time. But don’t you worry! We will always keep you in the loop by providing a notice on our website when a material change becomes effective.
