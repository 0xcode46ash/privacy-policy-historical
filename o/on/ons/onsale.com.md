# OnSale.com - World's Premiere Marketplace!

OnSale, Inc. and its affiliates (“OnSale,” “we, “us”) shares your concerns about the protection of your personal information online. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information through our family of websites, including the website currently located at www.onsale.com and other websites owned and operated by OnSale that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Site”). By using the Site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site.

Please note that OnSale reviews its privacy practices from time to time, and that those practices are subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by checking the “Last revised” legend at the bottom of the Policy. To contact OnSale about privacy issues, to report a violation of our Privacy Policy or to raise any other issue, please e-mail us at Privacy Q&A.

This Policy is the sole authorized statement of OnSale's practices with respect to the online collection of personally identifiable information and the usage of such information. Any summaries of this Policy generated by third party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" or "P3P") shall have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon OnSale, shall not be relied upon in substitute for this Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Policy.

The Information We Gather.

OnSale gathers two types of information about visitors to our Site:

(1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

We also use “cookies” — that is, small text files placed on a visitor’s computer hard drive — for a number of Site-related reasons, including to help us personalize your online auction experience, keep track of your buying and selling activities, recall your specific information on subsequent visits, assist in identifying problems with our server, monitor the length of time each visitor spends at any particular area of the Site and determine the popularity of the various OnSale services made available through the Site. Essentially, cookies are a visitor’s identification card for the OnSale computers, or servers, that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow OnSale to serve you better and more efficiently, and to further enhance the value of the Site to you. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience fully the interactive features on the Site. Additional information on cookies could be found at Cookies FAQs.

In addition, OnSale allows certain third-party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on OnSale web pages. Some of these companies may place a cookie on your computer. This cookie allows these companies to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, these companies may compile information about where the user of your computer viewed their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked on, allowing them to deliver targeted advertisements to you. OnSale does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by these companies. 

Site pages may also use “pixel tag” technology (also known as “web beacons”) to help us track visitors to those pages and to deliver co-branded and other services. OnSale may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or online newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are used as a statistical tool and not used to access your personal information. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Site pages may also contain web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help determine the effectiveness of OnSale’s online advertising campaigns.

(2) Personally identifiable information: In general, you do not have to provide personally identifiable information to us in order to use the Site. However, particular services made available through the Site may require us to collect personally identifiable information from you. We collect such personally identifiable information only when you affirmatively provide it to us - for example, when submitting information in order to participate in an online auction. You may be asked to provide your contact information (including, for example, first name, surname, street address, email address, telephone number) and, when applicable, credit card information.

Please note that we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining parental consent. 

We also note that, in particular instances, cookies placed on your computer may be linked to personally identifiable information that you have provided to us or our advertising partners. As noted above, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. 

OnSale does not control the acts of its Site visitors. All Site visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information through publicly-accessible Site features such as OnSale Report Card, OnSale Chat, OnSale Community, or other online forums, or in communications with other Site visitors, this information may be collected and used by others, and may be difficult or impossible to remove from the Site. In the event that you encounter any OnSale user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact Privacy Q&A. 

How We Use (and Do Not Use) the Information We Gather.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways that OnSale uses the information that it gathers. Keep in mind that, while OnSale encourages all third parties involved – including but not limited to its affiliates and advertisers – to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from OnSale or independently. 

(1) Non-personally identifiable information: OnSale uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas and services of the Site. We provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites. 

The Site contains links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by OnSale. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites’ use of any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.

(2) Personally identifiable information: OnSale seeks to provide notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected on the Site. OnSale reserves the right to release any personally identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Although you may not “opt out” of the registration process if you wish to use Site features that require registration, we attempt to provide you with an ability to “opt out” of receiving promotional materials from OnSale and/or its affiliates, advertisers or other business partners. If you decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional information from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly.

The “My OnSale” feature of the Site provides Site users with an ability to create personal profiles that can be used in connection with the Site and Site-related services. Such profile will contain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, address and, if you so choose, your credit card information. 

Some of the services that we provide in connection with the Site are fee-based; such service fees may be paid by you with your credit card. We note that, as part of the “My OnSale” feature or through your use of Site-related services, your credit card information may be disclosed by us to sellers and third parties in order to complete a transaction in which your payment is by credit card; you should use extreme caution before allowing your credit card information (and other personally identifiable information) to be accessed by such sellers and third parties, and you should investigate whether such sellers and third parties have a privacy policy the terms of which are acceptable to you before allowing access to such information. We note that only if the user voluntarily requests that the credit card information be transferred will any transfer take place — for example, if/when a user clicks a “submit form” button or other button. We note that sellers and other third parties may have privacy policies that differ significantly from this Policy. 

OnSale seeks to limit its own e-mail solicitations to those Site users who have not “opted out” of receiving such communications. The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will seek to clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and to provide the customer with either information regarding or a method for “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar nature. 

In addition, OnSale sometimes uses individual data to “target” advertising — to decide which advertisements and sponsor messages to show to which Site users. As an example, if Sponsor Co. wishes to display its advertising only to females, OnSale may use registration data to ensure that Sponsor Co.’s ads are displayed only to female visitors to the Site. 

OnSale may use individual users’ data to “pre-populate” forms which are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by OnSale and/or its sponsors. Such pre-population of a form does not automatically transfer any data to any advertiser or third party. Only if the user voluntarily requests that such data be transferred will any transfer take place — for example, if/when a user clicks a “submit form” button or other button. 

If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and reserve the right to use your email address, and any information you provide in your message, to respond thereto. Such contact information may also be used to send promotional materials to you unless you “opt out” of receiving such promotional materials of a similar nature from us. In addition, from time to time we may email important information regarding the use of the Site or services to visitors who have provided us with their email addresses. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not “opt out” of receiving these emails.

OnSale works with third parties who provide services that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, website hosting, ad serving, data analysis and email services. We reserve the right to share personally identifiable information with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services, and will seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers. 

Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to release information concerning any visitor when we believe that visitor is in violation of our User Agreement or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to release information about our visitors when we believe that such release is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of OnSale, our partners, our visitors or the public, or to respond to an emergency.

If and when OnSale sponsors contests or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor contests or sweepstakes in conjunction with OnSale, either OnSale or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes. If no such information is posted, this Policy and/or the sponsor’s privacy policy will govern the collection and use of such information. 

Occasionally OnSale or its third party sponsors may offer Site visitors an opportunity to participate in a survey, participation in which may require submission of personally identifiable information. Unless expressly provided otherwise in connection with the survey, this Policy and/or the sponsor’s privacy policy will govern the collection and use of such information. Again, you are always free not to participate in any survey. 

Security.

OnSale has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of visitor information which is under our control. Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of the foregoing, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between your computer and OnSale's servers, or any information provided to us or to any third party through or in connection with the Site. You provide all such information at your own risk.

Updating, Correcting, Changing, and Deleting Personal Information.

The “My OnSale” feature of the Site provides you with an ability to update, correct or change the personally identifiable information stored in your customer profile. Also, certain personally identifiable information can be deleted from your customer profile; for example, if your credit card information is part of your customer profile, you can choose to delete that information from your profile. Keep in mind, however, that there may be residual information that will remain within OnSale databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not intentionally be used by us for commercial purposes; however, OnSale reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or visitors to the Site.

Business Transfers.

OnSale reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the Site, to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business.

Offline vs. Online Practices. 

Please note that this Policy applies solely to our online information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.
