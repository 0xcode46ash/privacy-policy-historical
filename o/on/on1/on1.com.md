# Privacy Policy – ON1, Inc.

### Your Information

ON1, Inc.’s privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by ON1, Inc. anytime you interact with ON1 such as when you purchase an ON1 product, contact a technical support or sales associate, sign up for an e-newsletter or request a download of demonstration software.

We collect your personal information because it assists us in delivering a high level of customer service. For example, your personal information helps us to keep you informed and up-to-date on the latest product updates and announcements as well as special offers that may be extended from time to time.

When you provide ON1 with your name, email address, mailing address or telephone number, and you do not “opt-out”, ON1, Inc. and ON1 representatives and authorized affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information, new products and other ON1 information. Other than ON1, Inc. representatives and authorized affiliates (such as value-added resellers), ON1, Inc. does not offer, sell, or otherwise make available any user-provided information to third parties.

ON1 will send notifications regarding product updates and technical support notices. These messages are deemed essential to the functionality of your product and as such, there is no “opt-out” available for update notifications.

If you do not want ON1 or ON1 representatives to contact you, you may “opt-out” at any time. You may “opt-out” by contacting ON1’s Customer Service Department or by following the instructions included in the email correspondence.
