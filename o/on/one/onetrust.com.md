# OneTrust | Privacy Policy

Effective date: April 1st , 2016

We at OneTrust LLC. (“OneTrust,” “we” and “us”) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. **By using or accessing our website located at OneTrust.com (the “Website”) or any of our products, services or applications (including any pilot) (the “Service”) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.**

Remember that your use of OneTrust’s Services is at all times subject to any terms and conditions that you have agreed to with OneTrust, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in such terms and conditions. 

##### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below. 

We use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Website and Services only to: 

  * personalize (e.g. understanding your needs and preferences), provide, maintain and improve our Website or Services,
  * allow you to set up a user account and profile,
  * contact you about your use of the Website or Services,
  * fulfill your requests for or respond to your inquiries regarding certain products or services or employment consideration, 
  * meet legal and regulatory requirements, 
  * send you our newsletter or other product news, but only if you sign up for it, 
  * analyze how you use the Website or Services, and
  * other purposes where you provide us with explicit consent.



In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. If you provide us with notice that you plan on terminating your use of our Service, we will use our best efforts to promptly delete all of your Personal Information and cease any use thereof, provided that to the extent that we have already improved the Service or any product based on our use of your Personal Information (as allowed herein), we will continue to use those improvements, provided that any such information incorporated therein has been aggregated and de-identified. 

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@OneTrust.com. 

##### Will OneTrust ever change this Privacy Policy?

We’re constantly trying to improve our Website and Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on OneTrust.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. The foregoing legal notices will govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. 

##### What Information does OneTrust Collect?

###### Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information that you provide to us such as the names, email addresses, and phone numbers you input into the system. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. 

We will communicate with you via email and, possibly, other means if you have provided us the means to do so but only for the limited purposes described herein. If you provide contact information through our Website, we may send you a newsletter, or email you about our products or Services, and we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. 

You will be required to provide certain contact information during your registration for the Services. We will only use this information to communicate with you about your use of and access to the Services unless you explicitly consent to other communications. 

###### Cookie Policy:

We currently do not use any cookies on the OneTrust.com website. 

##### Will OneTrust Share Any of the Confidential Information it Receives?

We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section: 

**Agents:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company, a website analytics company or an email service provider (e.g. MailChimp). Unless we tell you differently and you consent, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

**Business Transfers:** We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. 

**Protection of OneTrust and Others:** We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our agreements with you and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OneTrust, our employees, our users, or others. 

##### Is Personal Information about me secure?

We have established commercially reasonable security practices to protect Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Among other practices, your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

##### What Personal Information can I access?

Within the Services, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:

  * name and password
  * email address



The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@onetrust.com . 

California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: support@OneTrust.com 

##### What choices do I have?

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. Until you terminate your use of the Services, when you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by emailing support@OneTrust.com. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. As stated earlier, if you provide us with notice that you plan on terminating your use of our Service, we will use our best efforts to promptly delete all of your Personal Information and cease any use thereof, provided that to the extent that we have already improved the Service or any product based on our use of your Personal Information (as allowed herein), we will continue to use those improvements, provided that any information incorporated therein has been aggregated and de-identified. 

##### Additional information for European Union users

We are the data controller for sign-up and account information that you provide to us from the European Union, but you are the data controller for any Personal Information you upload or submit through the Services, and we will only process such information in accordance with your instructions. You agree to comply with applicable data protection laws when you collect and submit Personal Information to us, such as requirements to inform data subjects about the uses and disclosures of their data. Please note that for users located in the EU, the term Personal Information used in this policy is equivalent to the term “personal data” under European data protection laws. 

IP addresses: Our servers automatically record the incoming IP addresses of our website visitors, and we store such IP addresses in log files. We use these log files for the following purposes: security purposes, system administration, controlling spam, Service analytics, determining your rough city or country location, and tracking referrals. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to OneTrust using your IP address for the foregoing purposes. 

You have the right to access, amend or delete any Personal Information we hold about you. Please contact us at support@OneTrust.com to exercise such right. 

Personal Information you submit on the Website or through the Services is sent to the United States and will be primarily processed by us in the United States, on our servers or on our hosted service providers’ cloud servers on our behalf. Some of our product offerings include the ability to host your data in servers located in the EU or other countries. To request this capability, contact support@OneTrust.com. The United States does not have similar data protection laws to the European Union. You expressly consent and agree that we may transfer and process your Personal Information to and in the United States. Your consent is voluntary, and you may revoke it by opting out at any time by contacting us at support@OneTrust.com. Please note that if you opt-out, we may no longer be able to provide you our Services. 

##### What if I have questions about this policy?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to support@OneTrust.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.
