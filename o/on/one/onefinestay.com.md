* Information automatically collected from your computer

  1.  **Log files/IP addresses**. When you visit the Site our web server automatically records your IP address. This IP address is not linked to any of your personal information. We may also gather other non-personal information (from which we cannot identify you) such as the type of your internet browser which we use to provide you with a more effective service. 
  2. **Cookies**. When you visit the Site we may store some information (commonly known as a “cookie”) on your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Passwords and credit card numbers are not stored in cookies. A cookie helps you get the best out of the Site and helps us to provide you with a more customised service. We use cookies for the following purposes: 
    1. Storing details about your site preferences (for instance which language you wish to view pages in); 
    2. Storing details about any properties you have short-listed; 
    3. Enabling our web server to track your session between pages of the site and provide a continuity of experience.
  3. You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you want to (your browser’s help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain parts of the Site are reliant on the use of cookies to operate correctly and may not work correctly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.
  4. When using our site, there are a number third parties who also need to store cookies for essential running of the site. These include but are not limited to:
    1. Amazon for the running of our load balancers;
    2. Google to enable Interactive Maps, help us with Analytics and provide re-marketing campaigns tailored to your browsing using Google Advertiser Features. If you wish to opt out out of the Google Advertiser Features please click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ "Opt Out of Google Advertiser Features") for details.
  5. If you have any other concerns, please contact us. 



## Other Sites

  1. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our Site and recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions. 
  2. In addition, if you linked to this Site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.



## Transferring your information outside of Europe

  1. As part of the services offered to you through the Site, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Union (“EU”). By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EU. We may also share information between group companies, which may be located in countries worldwide. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we transfer your information outside of the EU in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this privacy policy.
  2. If you use the Site while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
