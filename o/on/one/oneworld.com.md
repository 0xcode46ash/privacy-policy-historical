# oneworld - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. **one** worldÂ® pledges to be responsible when gathering your personal information and to protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy should answer your questions about the sources and kinds of information we collect, how we use it, when it may be shared with others, and how we safeguard its confidentiality and security. We also provide you with ways to correct the data you provide us and to limit our sharing of this data with third parties. **one** world reserves the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If we modify or update our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here, and any modifications will apply to all information collected by **one** world, including previously collected information.

**one** world is an alliance of eight international airlines - American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas, Cathay Pacific Airways, Iberia, LAN, Finnair and Aer Lingus. The alliance is based in Vancouver, Canada. As an alliance, **one** world and its members share information, including personal information. Therefore, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we may share data about sites' visitors to third parties located both inside and outside Canada.

  * You, when you voluntarily provide us with information; 
  * Your browser, when you visit our websites and your browser interacts with us;

  * Other sources, in connection with providing your transportation needs and services.

In addition to obtaining your personal information, when you use our sites, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the sites. **one** world gets this information by using technologies, including cookies to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our sites and to better tailor our sites to our visitors' needs. None of this tracking information identifies you personally; we collect it for reporting onsite activity in the aggregate. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our sites or which pages or features get the most attention.

.

  * Corporate information (unless it is also about any identifiable person) 
  * Other websites accessed through a link from our websites. In this case the Privacy Policy of the owner of the linked website will apply.

If you are under 16 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) to **one** world without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If **one** world learns that you are under 16 years of age, **one** world will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable consent. 

**one** world believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the **one** world websites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.
