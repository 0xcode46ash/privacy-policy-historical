We want to help you achieve your goals with value-added message delivery service that allows us to establish a lasting relationship that grows to meet your changing needs. And the better we know you, the better we are able to serve you. That's why we ask for personal information, so that we can:

As a condition of employment, our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement that binds them to this responsibility - even if they leave or retire from One Call Now™. We keep our employees informed about our policies and procedures for protecting personal information and reinforce the importance of complying with them. All employees are also required, as a condition of employment, to conform to these policies and procedures.

We may use other companies to provide services to you on our behalf.

You have consented to the release of personal information. For example, you are part of a larger organization and want them to be able to reach you. 

We have a legal obligation. For example, we may release personal information about a client to legal authorities in cases of the public's interest, criminal activity or the detection and prevention of fraud. If we release information for any of these reasons, we keep a record of what, when, why and to whom such information was released.

How Can I Access My Personal Information?   
If you want to review or verify your personal information - or find out to whom we have disclosed it, as permitted by this Policy - please contact us.

"Parents, especially those who work out of town, love getting the notices by phone so that they can make arrangements for child care when the regular schedule changes. Our school even has parents call to suggest additional ways to use it." 

"I was outspent 3-to-1 on mailings, newspaper ads and yard signs, and the other party had far more registered voters, yet, the response from calls One Call Now made led to my upset victory" 

"Every year our middle school ministry hosts a summer kick-off LUAU. Using One Call Now to promote it this year, we recorded the call using surfer lingo and music in the background. Our families loved it." 

One Call Now is such a great benefit for our church. The calling system has enabled us to reach our entire congregation quickly and efficiently. We plan to never be without the One Call Now system and recommend it for EVERY church! 

"I made one call, recorded the message, and bang—every parent got the message. We had a huge turnout despite bad weather. I could have sent flyers, but they rarely get a good response, I doubt most parents ever see them." 

"Our soccer club has ten competitive teams and two high school teams that utilize the One Call Now service. We have found it invaluable due to the ever changing weather and the rescheduling of games and practices." 

We used to have a prayer chain that took hours. With your system we have prayer out to the whole church within minutes of the need. We also put all of our activities and information out on One Call Now and use the website banner. You have saved us over 40 hours on the phone in only six months. God Bless You. 

We've had very positive responses from our families. They were very appreciative about improving the communication between the school and our families. 

"This is much more reliable - now I'm confident that every family gets the call or receives the message. We usually do the calls during the day specifically so that we get the answering machine." 

"The staff is always helpful and courteous and stand ready to share savings when available; our group did not used all time calls allotted to us therefore a staff member evaluated our usage to a great savings to us." 

"By calling not only all our parents, but every voter in the wards that historically support the schools, we won by a decisive margin." 

"Our Preschool Director would use One Call Now to record messages describing how we were responding to the epidemic and what experts were consulted." 

"One Call Now has improved communications for my youth ministry work tremendously. The customer service agents are so accommodating: I can hardly believe how easily it is to adjust the accounts to fit my needs." 

"We only had 15 minutes until game time and needed everyone there asap. I made one phone call with directions to all 12 parents and everyone arrived with about 5 minutes to spare. One Call Now saved our season." 

"I just want you to know how pleased I am with this service. One Call Now has saved us hours in manual phone calls and given us the best tool to contact our entire team with one phone call!" 

"I am personnel manager for an industrial construction company. We are always in need of different crafts. I send message to all my workers, and I can fill the positions within 15 minutes." 

"Being a nonprofit organization and the cost of pagers for activation of our members, the One Call Now system is a much more cost effective resource for our team!" 

"We learned about the services of One Call Now on Saturday night, and we needed the message to get delivered to all voters in Malibu on the following Monday morning." 

"I have noticed that if I send out a phone message I have more than doubled our attendance" 

"I made one call from my cell phone on the road Saturday, and 10,000 parents received my call that afternoon. The attendance boost we got from that call really helped us. We will capture almost $1 million more than last year in state aid monies" 

"I have been using your service for 4 years now. I can tell you that I would never coach or have a group of people that I need to stay in contact without your service." 

"Thank you very much. The service that One Call Now and your team members provide is exemplary." 

"One Call Now is a service that has made the coaching jobs much more efficient and enjoyable. Thank you for this remarkable service!!!" 

"We had Dick Van Dyke record our message to Malibu voters. A referendum that was expecting a close vote and less than 40% turnout, had record turnout, and we won with 58% of the vote." 

"I used it today. It is awesome! This service is great!!!! Everyone I talk to I am telling them to sign up." 

"Our children’s safety is of the highest concern and One Call Now has provided us with a means to ensure safety—quickly!" 

"Using One Call Now has allowed us to get the messages to our members without trying to get volunteers to physically make all the calls themselves. It has saved us hundreds of man hours!!" 

"Thanks so much for ensuring that working parents with hectic schedules had the ability to do their jobs, and spend more time with their children at night. One Call Now is a lifesaver for me." 

"The call reaches my office after recording the message before I have a chance to hang up the phone...it's that fast! Keep up the good work!" 

"This is PRAISE for tech support at One Call Now. They were so supportive and worked very hard to input our shopping center merchant list under the 'threat of an impending Hurricane Dennis' where time was most important."
