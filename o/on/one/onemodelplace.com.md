_Security_  
This website takes every precaution to protect our customer's information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, such information is protected both online and off-line.

OMP use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online and do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our customer's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example billing administration or the development team) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. 

Supplementation of Information (validation of submitted details) In order for OMP to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

For example, OMP may use the WHOIS database, Government sourced companies house database or Dun & Bradstreet company lookup information to validate the accuracy of supplied data. This is an integral aspect of the service provided by OMP.

_Service Updates_  
Established customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our customers we present the option not to receive these types of communications. We also send the user service announcement updates. Customers are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which may contain important security information about the service.

_Updating Customer Information_  
If a customer's personally identifiable information requires specific information changes they may update the original information provided. Logging into the Manage My account and using the services provided in the Manage Account section.

If customers no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners, they may opt-out of receiving these communications by canceling their membership in OMP.

Customers of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our customers can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

_Customer consent_  
By using our Web site, customers consent to the collection and use of information by OMP. If any subsequent changes are made to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the policy update page so that customers are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it may be disclosed.
