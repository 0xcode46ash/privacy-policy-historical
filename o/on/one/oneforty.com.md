# Privacy Policy - oneforty

### oneforty inc.

### PRIVACY POLICY

### Last updated December 2009

By using oneforty.com (the “Website”), you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy. 

oneforty inc. (“oneforty”) is founded on the principle of enabling the Twitter community to get more out of Twitter. We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously.  This Privacy Policy covers oneforty’s treatment of personal information that we gather when you are on the Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that oneforty does not own or control, or to individuals that oneforty does not employ or manage, including but not limited to the third-party sites that may be accessed through oneforty. 

### What information does oneforty collect?

In connection with your use of the Website, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from you in different ways. 

We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). In addition to the individually-oriented information above, we also collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities or users, such as tracking the number of people who view certain pages or use certain features of the Website. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, such as the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research. This information is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or if it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. 

We do not collect your Twitter password.  We use OAuth, an open protocol, as the method to interact with protected data from Twitter.  It means that we never have your Twitter password unless you expressly provide it.  If you make a purchase or are managing purchase history on oneforty, we may ask you to create and provide us with a specific password for oneforty services. This password is not shared with any other third party, including Twitter. 

### Cookies

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Websites to help us provide better customer service.  We collect this information through the use of various technologies, including one called “cookies”.  Cookies are small pieces of data, or data files, which are sent by a website to your web browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. 

When you sign into oneforty through Twitter, a cookie is sent to your computer that contains an identification number that is unique to the computer you are using.  This cookie enables us to keep you signed into oneforty on this computer until you explicitly press the “sign out” button located in the top-right area of the oneforty site. This way you will be able to interact with oneforty easily as you browse the internet, just as you can with Twitter. We rely on Twitter's authentication to identify you, so as their cookies lapse, you may need to log into oneforty again. 

### Sharing of your oneforty account information

Because oneforty enables people to interact within the Twitter community, information about the people who use oneforty is an integral part of the oneforty experience. We will neither rent nor sell your personal information (e.g., your name, address, email address, etc.) to anyone. We require that oneforty partners who may need some aspect of your personal information (for example, to fulfill a purchase you make on oneforty) will also not share, rent, or sell your personal information. We will never look at your personal information unless you are having technical difficulties, the law requires it, or it is necessary to maintain our system. We may disclose aggregated data and statistics in order to describe our Website and services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties for other lawful purposes, however, we will only share your personal information as described below: 

  1. Social Interactions  
Your interactions on oneforty are public by default. At this time, there is no way to hide your contributions on oneforty since they become part of the community. This includes product reviews.
  2. Friend search  
The Twitter username that you use upon registration will become a part of your public profile, as it is on Twitter.
  3. Purchases  
We will share limited personal information, only to the extent necessary, to third parties solely for fulfillment and support of purchases you make on oneforty. These third parties have agreed, in the Publisher Agreement, not to share, rent, or sell your personal information with any other parties.



### oneforty email communications

We will not provide your email address, should you provide it to us, to a third party except for purchase fulfillment and support or as required by applicable law or court order. You may receive notification emails from oneforty that inform you of actions (e.g. if your suggestion is accepted) that have been performed on the oneforty site. In addition, you may receive system emails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords), and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us as long as you have a oneforty account. 

### Children under 18 years of age

You must be 13 years and older to register to use the oneforty website. As a result, oneforty does not specifically collect information about children under the age of 13. If we learn that oneforty has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using oneforty or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet. 

### Additional Privacy Information

Please remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line, in any news or message postings or chat rooms, may be collected and used by others without your permission.  Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who provide websites that are linked to or from our Website, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.  We encourage you to review these sites’ policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.
