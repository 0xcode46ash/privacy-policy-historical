# Privacy & Security

We are committed to respecting your privacy, maintaining your trust, and making use of any information you provide us in a responsible manner. 

##### Information we gather

###### Purchases

When you place an order, we collect the items you wish to order, the buyer and package recipient's name, address and telephone number, in addition to the buyer's email address and credit card information.

###### Online Account

You have the option of establishing a password protected online account in which you may then save addresses, review a history of your online purchases, utilize our gift registry and reminder service, and sign up to receive our periodic email updates.

###### Product Reviews and Surveys

At any time you may submit a product review. Occasionally, we offer you the opportunity to participate in mini-surveys.

###### Cookies, Pixel Tags, Log Files and Links

Cookies, pixel tags, log files and links tell us how you use our site, but are not used to collect or store personally identifiable information.

###### Email Updates

Email updates provide users with the ability to receive information on new products and services, sales and special promotions. We ask for your email address, name, and zip code. You may also answer a few optional, more personal questions (such as whether or not you are expecting or if you are a grandparent) for the purpose of receiving information and promotions that are specifically designed for you. We also work with a reputable third party company, for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics, where we share with our third party company site usage information about visitors to our site who have received targeted emails from us. For this purpose, we and our third party company note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).

##### How information is used

###### By Us

To ensure the security of your credit card information, we employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card information, so that it cannot be read as it is sent through the Internet and is only used by us to fulfill your order. The balance of the information collected, such as names, addresses, purchasing patterns, web activities via cookies, pixel tags, log files and links, product reviews and survey answers are used, in an aggregate form, to help us understand the needs of our customers and those who visit our web site.

###### By Others

We use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you. Some of these companies are given access to some, or all, of the information you provide to us and may use cookies on our behalf. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our site. For more information, including how to opt out, please go to: [http://www.coremetrics.com](http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html).
