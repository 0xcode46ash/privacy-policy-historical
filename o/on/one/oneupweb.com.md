# Oneupweb :: Integrated Online & Search Engine Marketing: Our Privacy Policy

## Oneupweb® respects the privacy of its users

Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other users.

In order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this statement disclosing the privacy practices for the entire Oneupweb® site. Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular service.

Here, you will learn what personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

## What Information is Collected

Oneupweb® collects certain information from and about its users in three ways -- directly from the user and from our Web server logs. User-Supplied Information: When you submit a form we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, and some other personal information. The more accurate information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize your Oneupweb® experience.

## Log Information

When you visit an Internet Web site, you disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet [Protocol] (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a Oneupweb® page). Oneupweb®, like many other sites, records this basic information about visits to its site. You should remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, your information can be collected and used by others. Although Oneupweb® tries to protect your personal information, Oneupweb® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are also solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information.

## How and When Information is Used

We use information in different ways, depending on the type of information: User-supplied information: This information is used for purposes such as personalization and verification. Web Server Logs: This information helps us identify which areas of our site are of interest to our visitors. Oneupweb® also collects the Internet [Protocol] (IP) addresses of its visitors for the purposes of system administration.

## How We Protect Your Information

The privacy and protection of your personal information is vitally important to us. Oneupweb® does not make personal information available to any third parties without your permission. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding your Oneupweb® usage are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.

Your access to some services and content is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Oneupweb® will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. You should not disclose your user name and password to others.

In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of your Oneupweb® account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your personal information, Oneupweb® cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

## Who Has Access to the Information

Except as described, Oneupweb® will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about its users to any third party without first receiving that user's permission. Oneupweb® may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the rights or property of Oneupweb®. When you are at the Oneupweb® site and asked for personal information, you share that information with Oneupweb® alone.

We welcome any questions or comments you have about the Oneupweb® site.

### Canine Security

We’d like to tell you that Fritter is the keeper of our database like that other famous dog that keeps the secret baked beans recipe. But honestly, she’s too busy making sure the UPS guy knows his place to be bothered.
