# Privacy Policy | One Money Design

I  recognize that privacy of your personal information is important.  It is for me too.  Below is information on what types of personal information my website receives and collects when you use and visit it.  I will never sell your personal information to third parties.

Log Files:  As with most other websites, One Money Desgin collects and uses the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

Cookies and Web Beacons:  One Money Design does use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some features.

One Money Design also uses third party advertisements to support the site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off One Money Design cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with One Money Design as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
