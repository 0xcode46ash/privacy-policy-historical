**OneSource Information Services Inc. Privacy Policy

Our Commitment

** OneSource Information Services, Inc. (“OneSource”) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our Web site and users of our products.  We are providing this privacy statement to you because we take privacy issues seriously.  We think you should know how we may be collecting and using your personal information through our Web site and within the OneSource® products. 

**Tracking Your Computer**   
OneSource may track and retain information about the computing environment you use to access our Web site and products, such as your IP address, browser type or operating system. We must collect and analyze this information for the continued improvement of our products. 

**Personal Information You Provide  
** The identifying information you provide to OneSource allows us to determine if you are an authorized user of one or more of our products, for which you or your organization has paid a fee. We need to know your personal identifying information in order to provide you with all the benefits you are entitled to receive as an authorized user of our products.  For instance, you may be asked to provide us with your physical and online contact information (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.), particularly if you seek customer support from our Help Desk.  In addition, we may ask for work-related identifying information (e.g. employer, job title, etc.) in order to inform you of product updates. OneSource may retain the personal information you provide to us as part of our ongoing efforts to extend the best service possible to you while you use our products. 

**Do We Aggregate User Data?  
** OneSource may aggregate the information you provide with similar information collected from other visitors to our Web site or users of our products in order to evaluate or enhance our Web site or products.  OneSource may use the aggregated data to determine the usage patterns, interests or other characteristics of visitors to our Web site or users of our products, or for the technical support and security of this Web site and our computer systems. The aggregated data that we evaluate, however, contains no personal information or other information that could identify an individual.

**Usage Tracking within the OneSource products  
** We may track usage information within our products based upon the number of reports and types of reports that are accessed by a particular UserID number. We do this to monitor authorized usage of our products and to improve the design and functionality of our products. Customers can also track the total number of reports in the product that are accessed at the user level or accessed by all users within their organization for administrative purposes. 

We may also aggregate corporate or industry information accessed by all of our clients. We do this in order to appreciate the types of companies and industries for which our customers require information, which in turn improves the quality of our products. OneSource does not correlate the accessed corporate or industry information to a specific user or to a particular organization. 

**Do We Provide User Information to Third Parties?**   
OneSource does not provide your personal information or any usage information to third parties, except that OneSource may, on occasion, provide some general usage information from our products to our data suppliers for royalty-related purposes.  Any information that we may provide to our data suppliers contains no personal details about any users. Additionally, no information that we collect from our Website or products or that you provide to us is ever sold to third parties.  We may, however, disclose information collected from our Website or products to protect our legal rights or in response to a court order, or in connection with a sale or merger of OneSource or its assets.  Such disclosures would be subject to protective orders or confidentiality agreements.

**How We Use Cookies  
** OneSource uses “cookies” only to validate users authorized to access our various products. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by a Web server. OneSource does not use cookies to track any personal information about a user. For example, the User ID (log in name) and the site ID (company name) are tracked to allow OneSource to determine whether or not the user is authorized (i.e. licensed) to access a specific product on our Web site.  Also, a machine ID is identified to ensure that only one person uses the UserID at one time.  In addition, the user may, at his or her option, identify a workgroup or project that in turn establishes a cookie; this option is provided not for OneSource’s purposes but to permit a user’s organization to charge back costs internally.

**Server Security  
** The OneSource servers are physically secure and may be accessed by authenticated OneSource employees only.  Such individuals are required to maintain the security of the servers and the confidentiality of the information contained in the servers.

**Your Access  
** You may access your personal information electronically in the Business Browser product through the Account Maintenance option that is accessible from the “shortcuts” menu located in the navigation bar.  You may change your personal information as often as you like and even print out a copy of the personal information for your records. 

**If You Have a Concern**   
Should you have a concern about OneSource’s collection or use of your personal information, OneSource would like to hear about it.  You may contact our Help Desk in the United States at 1-800-433-0287 or in the United Kingdom at +44(0)1483-241241 or elsewhere at +1-978-318-4650.  You may also use the “Feedback” button in the product to send an email directly to us or write to Customer Service at our corporate headquarters identified below.

**Who Are We?  
** OneSource Information Services, Inc. is providing this privacy statement to you as a registered user of one or more of our products or as a visitor to our Web site. Our corporate headquarters are located at 300 Baker Avenue, Concord, Massachusetts 01742 in the United States.  You may reach our U.S. corporate headquarters by telephone at 1-978-318-4300 or fax 1-978-318-4690.
