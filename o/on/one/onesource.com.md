OneSource Privacy Statement 

Our Commitment   
OneSource Information Services, Inc. (“OneSource”) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our Web site and users of our products. We are providing this privacy statement to you because we take privacy issues seriously. We think you should know how we may be collecting and using information about you through our Web site and within the OneSource® products.

Safe Harbor Compliance   
As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy, OneSource has elected to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles of the United States Department of Commerce. By certifying this election with the Department of Commerce, OneSource has declared that it provides adequate privacy protection, as defined by the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection. Additional information about the Safe Harbor Program and the Directive on Data Protection can be obtained at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

Tracking Your Computer   
OneSource may track and retain information about the computing environment you use to access our Web site and products, such as your IP address, browser type or operating system. We collect and analyze this information for the continued improvement of our products. For example, tracking the computing environments most frequently used by our customers can help us to accommodate the most appropriate browser types and versions. Additionally, our record of IP addresses that access our products allows us to determine the source or cause of error messages that may appear in our products at any given time, or to assist customers who may be experiencing technical difficulties while accessing the OneSource products.

Personal Information You Provide   
The personal information you provide to OneSource allows us to determine if you are an authorized user of one or more of our products, for which you or your organization has paid a fee. We need to know your personal information in order to provide you with all the benefits you are entitled to receive as an authorized user of our products. For instance, you may be asked to provide us with your physical and online contact information (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.), particularly if you seek customer support from our Help Desk. In addition, we may ask for work-related identifying information (e.g. employer, job title, etc.) in order to inform you of product updates. OneSource may retain the personal information you provide to us in order to more easily assist you with customer service or technical support of our products and to continue to forward new product information. 

Do We Aggregate User Data?   
OneSource may aggregate the information you provide with similar information collected from other visitors to our Web site or users of our products in order to evaluate or enhance our Web site or products. Specifically, OneSource may use the aggregated data to determine the usage patterns or interests of visitors to our Web site or users of our products, or for purposes related to the technical support or security of this Web site and our computer systems. The aggregated data that we evaluate, however, contains no personal information or other information that could identify an individual.

Usage Tracking within the OneSource products   
We may track usage information within our products based upon the number of reports and types of reports that are accessed by a particular UserID number. We do this to monitor authorized usage of our products and to improve the design and functionality of our products. Customers can also track the total number of reports in the product that are accessed at the user level or accessed by all users within their organization for administrative purposes. 

We may also aggregate corporate or industry information accessed by all of our clients. We do this in order to appreciate the types of companies and industries for which our customers require information, which in turn improves the quality of our products. OneSource does not correlate the accessed corporate or industry information to a specific user or to a particular organization. 

Do We Provide User Information to Third Parties?   
OneSource does not share your personal information or any usage information with third parties, except that OneSource may, on occasion, provide some general usage information from our products to our data suppliers for royalty-related purposes. Any information that we may provide to our data suppliers contains no personal details about individual users. Additionally, no information that we collect from our Web site or products or that you provide to us is ever sold to third parties. When appropriate or required we may disclose information, including personal information, collected from our Web site or products to protect our legal rights or in response to a court order, or in connection with a sale or merger of OneSource or its assets. OneSource will endeavor to make such disclosures subject to protective orders or confidentiality agreements.

How We Use Cookies   
OneSource uses “cookies” to validate users authorized to access our various products. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by a Web server. OneSource does not use cookies to track any personal information about a user. For example, the User ID (log in name) and the site ID (company name) are tracked to allow OneSource to determine whether or not the user is authorized (i.e. licensed) to access a specific product on our Web site. Also, a machine ID is identified to ensure that only one person uses the UserID at one time. In addition, the user may, at his or her option, identify a workgroup or project that in turn establishes a cookie; this option is provided not for OneSource’s purposes but to permit a user’s organization to charge back costs internally.

Marketing the OneSource Products   
When you register as a user of the OneSource products you have the option to allow us to contact you about our products and services. In order to evaluate your use of our products, OneSource may track which functions of our products you use most frequently. This information will help us provide you with only the most relevant and useful information about our products, as well as suggestions that could enhance your use of our products. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us you may opt out by updating your account through the Account Maintenance option described below, except that you may still receive certain communications from us at the request of your organization. OneSource will not share information about your use of our products with third parties.

Server Security   
The OneSource servers are physically secure and may only be accessed by OneSource’s technical or support personnel whose jobs specifically relate to maintaining the integrity of the OneSource servers or supporting product-related functions. Such individuals are required to maintain the security of the servers and the confidentiality of the information contained in the servers.

Third Party Sites   
As a subscriber to our products you may decide to visit a third party’s Web site through a limited number of links available in our products. Although the OneSource branding may still be visible, you will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy, if one exists. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third party Web sites you choose to visit. OneSource is not responsible for how that third party may collect or use your personal information.

Account Maintenance Option   
You may access your personal information electronically in the Business Browser product through the Account Maintenance option that is accessible from the “shortcuts” menu located in the navigation bar. You may change your personal information as often as you like and even print out a copy of the personal information for your records. 

If You Have a Concern   
Should you have a concern about OneSource’s collection or use of your personal information, OneSource would like to hear about it. You may contact our Help Desk in the United States at 1-800-433-0287 or in the United Kingdom at +44(0)1483-241241 or elsewhere at +1-978-318-4650. You may also email us at privacy@onesource.com or write to Customer Service at our corporate headquarters identified below.

We may change this privacy statement from time to time and will post those changes here to keep you up-to-date on how we may be collecting and using your personal information.
