# One Medical Passport Privacy Policy

Your privacy and the security of the data you provide are of the utmost importance to us.  Because we gather medical information we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.  We understand your medical information is a very personal subject, and we want to make you are as comfortable as possible.  This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.  Questions regarding this statement should be directed to One Medical Passport’s Support unit. 

Information collected on the Internet can be categorized as either anonymous or identifiable. 

Anonymous information is information that can’t be necessarily traced to a specific individual.  This type of information provides One Medical Passport with data to make the site easier to use (like what types and versions of browsers are used).  This information does not allow us to necessarily know the identity of users.  Identifiable information is information that tells us exactly who you are.  This information is essential for One Medical Passport to be able to protect your personal information and allow you to access it. 

Anonymous Information  
The One Medical Passport Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes.  This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting.  We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.  We also collect information about what types and versions of browsers are used.  This allows us to enhance our site and ensure that nearly everyone can use it.  Other similar statistics may also be collected.

  Identifiable Information  
This information is collected in one of three ways: (1) when you [register](https://web.archive.org/web/20150320225159id_/https%3A//www.onemedicalpassport.com/lobby/lobby.asp) as a patient, (2) when you fill out a preoperative questionnaire, and (3) when you log into [Patient Admissions](https://web.archive.org/web/20150320225159id_/https%3A//www.onemedicalpassport.com/lobby/lobby.asp) or modify a preoperative questionnaire.

  Patient Registration  
Upon [registering](https://web.archive.org/web/20150320225159id_/https%3A//www.onemedicalpassport.com/lobby/lobby.asp) as a patient on One Medical Passport, your name, address, phone number, date of birth, sex, a username, and password will be stored.  This information is needed to uniquely identify you and your preoperative questionnaires.

  Preoperative Questionnaire  
Each time you fill out a preoperative questionnaire the medical history you provide will be accessible to the doctor performing the procedure and the medical facility where the procedure is to take place.

  Logging Into Patient Admissions or Modifying a Preoperative Questionnaire  
Whenever you enter [Patient Admissions](https://web.archive.org/web/20150320225159id_/https%3A//www.onemedicalpassport.com/lobby/lobby.asp) or modify a questionnaire a log record is created for security purposes.  If, for any reason, there is a question about who is accessing information and when it was accessed, the log file can be reviewed.

**YOUR INFORMATION IS NEVER SHARED WITH ANYONE BUT YOUR DOCTOR AND ESSENTIAL MEDICAL FACILITY STAFF**

One Medical Passport will never send you a mass emailing and will only contact you to respond to a request or question.  Your information is only provided to relevant medical facility staff and doctors when you fill out a preoperative questionnaire.  A medical facility staff member may only access your preoperative questionnaire submission if they are registered as a staff member of the medical facility where your procedure is scheduled to take place.  If you have not scheduled a procedure with a medical facility, a staff member can not access your information.  A doctor may only access your submission if they are the doctor specified as performing the procedure.  A doctor may not access your record if they are not specified as performing the procedure.  A very limited number of One Medical Passport staff may also have access to private information (see Security Procedures in Place to Protect Information for a full description). 

When you register with One Medical Passport the information is collected and maintained solely by One Medical Passport.  Your information is not used for mailings, studies, or marketing.  The information you provide is only used for your scheduled preoperative visit. 

A _cookie_ is a small data file that some Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.  One Medical Passport uses a temporary cookie to keep your place while you are logged in, but stores no personal information on your computer.  This cookie is deleted when you exit One Medical Passport. 

Technical  
One Medical Passport operates a secure data network protected by an industry standard firewall.  Our firewall acts to allow only certain types of messages to pass to and from our site.  This only allows legitimate One Medical Passport messages to be sent to our system and refuses all other messages before they can reach any sensitive information.  Our systems are also monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This is to ensure all of the protections are functioning correctly.  We also remain up to date on all security advances and risks.  As a further security measure, our database is not accessible via the Internet.  All confidential information is transmitted using 256-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption (Green Address Bar).  Using encryption involves ‘scrambling’ transmitted data, so that if a person were able to intercept the information, they would not be able to understand it.  If there are 75 or more minutes of inactivity within your session you will be required to reenter your username and password.  This protects your information while you are away from your machine.

Patient  
A username and password are required to access your information.  You are ultimately responsible for the security of your username and password.  Please take care to select a password that you don’t need to write down, but that is unique.  If you do need to store your password, keep it separate from your username.

One Medical Passport Staff  
Only a very limited number of One Medical Passport employees are allowed to access personal information.  All employees must abide by our privacy policy and any violations are subject to disciplinary action (up to and including termination).  Access to systems is restricted by using token authentication and is not accessible through the Internet.

You may modify your personal information by entering [Patient Admissions](https://web.archive.org/web/20150320225159id_/https%3A//www.onemedicalpassport.com/lobby/lobby.asp) from the homepage.  Once you have identified yourself by entering your username and password you may then select ‘Edit your personal information’ or ‘Change your password’. 

If you wish to be removed from One Medical Passport’s database for any reason you may contact our Support unit with your name and username.  Once we have verified your identity we will remove any existing information from our systems. 

Should you contact us through our Contact form we will contact you by the means you have specified.  We will retain your message for later referral should you ever contact us again.  Your request may also be used to determine areas of the site that may be enhanced in the future. 

We have provided external links to other sites (such as a verifier of our 128-bit SSL certificate) that are outside the control of One Medical Passport.  If you click these links, you will enter sites that may have different privacy policies from One Medical Passport. 

If a language other than English is selected by the patient the page is translated with Google Translate. The page contents are sent to Google, translated, and then returned in the specified language. Google does not log any of this text. If you are viewing the site in English no information is sent to Google.
