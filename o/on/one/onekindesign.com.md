# Privacy Policy | Onekindesign.com

One Kindesign has created this privacy policy to help protect your privacy. Your privacy is extremely important to us, so while we want to provide you with the information you are looking for, we still want to maintain your privacy. To further protect your privacy, this notice will help to explain in detail about our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Information We Collect

Here on One Kindesign we present to you the opportunity to enter contests, vote in polls, post comments and subscribe to our daily newsletter. When you participate in any of these things, we will ask you for personally identifiable information, which can include your name and e-mail address.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Mozilla, Firefox), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., AT&T, Cox). We may additionally collect your IP address (Internet Protocol address), which shows the location of where you are accessing the internet from, such as your work, home or school.

## Use of Information

If you submit content for publication, we may publish your name and any other information that you have provided to us.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer additional services. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information, and administer our website.

We will disclose information in our database when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.

We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While we will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, 1 Kindesign does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

## Cookies

To enhance your online experience we use “cookies.” Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer’s browser to store all of your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

Here on One Kindesign, cookies are used to help better understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings and advertisements. We may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.

## Changes to this Policy

One Kindesign may change this Privacy Policy at any time. The revised Privacy Policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please send us an email on our [contact form](http://onekindesign.com/contact/).
