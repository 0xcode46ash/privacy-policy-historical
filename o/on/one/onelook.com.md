**Welcome to OneLook® Dictionary Search**

Think of this web site as a search engine for words: If you have a word for which you'd like a definition or translation, we'll quickly shuttle you to the web-based dictionaries that define or translate that word. If you don't know how to spell the word, we'll help you do that too. No word is too obscure: More than 4 million words in more than 800 online dictionaries are indexed by the OneLook® search engine.

What can you do at OneLook.com? 

  * **Define words** : Type a word into the search box on the [front page](https://web.archive.org/) to retrieve a list of dictionary web sites that define that word. Be sure "Find definitions" is selected. 
  * **Translate words** : Type a word into the search box and select "Find translations" to retrieve a list of dictionary web sites that have _translations_ of that word into other languages. 
  * **Find words** : Type a _pattern_ consisting of letters and the wildcards `*` and `?` to retrieve a list of words matching your pattern. The asterisk (`*`) matches any number of letters or symbols. The question mark (`?`) matches exactly one letter or symbol. ([More info on wildcards](https://web.archive.org/?c=faq#patterns).) 

You can explore the other links above this box for more information on OneLook.com. (Don't forget to check out our cool [customization](https://web.archive.org/?c=customize) features!) Please [read our FAQ](https://web.archive.org/?c=faq) or send us feedback if you have any questions. When you're ready to try it out, simply [return to the front page](https://web.archive.org/).  **Access OneLook® Dictionary Search from any site!**

Internet Explorer users on Windows, 

**[click here](https://web.archive.org/oldef.reg)** to install a "right click" menu option that lets you define any word on any web page. 

To complete the installation, select "Open this file from its current location" after you click on the link above. Then hit "OK" and/or "Yes" to confirm the registry setting change (don't worry, it's completely harmless!) 

You'll then need to open a new browser window or restart IE in order for the feature to take effect. Next time you're stumped by a word on the Web, simply highlight it, click your right mouse button, and choose "Find Definitions..." from the menu, as shown above. 

Instructions on [how to uninstall this add-on](https://web.archive.org/?c=uninstall-rightclick) are available.
