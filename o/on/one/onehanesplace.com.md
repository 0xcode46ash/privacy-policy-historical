Besides Personal Information, when you access the Site our web servers may automatically recognize and collect information regarding your referring domain, your type of internet browser, operating system software, screen resolution, cookie preferences and similar technical data. None of this information is personally identifiable and we use this information only in the aggregate, to measure overall Site usage patterns and trends.

We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Information where children are involved. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that such child's parent or guardian call 1-800-671-5056 or contact us at [ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com](http://www.onehanesplace.com/webapp/commerce/command/ExecMacro/info.d2w/report?info=CustServEmail) and we will delete the information about the child from our files. 

If we publish Postings that you submit to us for potential publication, we may identify you as the source of such information by first name, last initial and city of residence or as otherwise indicated on the applicable submission pages. Any information about yourself submitted in a "public" area of our Site and/or other areas or features, may allow members of the general public to view such submitted information and content on the Internet, may be routed through our servers, the servers of one or more third parties on our behalf, and the Internet, **and you have no expectation of or right to privacy with regard to any such Posting**. We have no obligation to monitor any Postings, particularly as to the content of e-cards or similar features where visitors have the option of creating a message. Such public areas and features offered therein are public and not private communications. The security of any information you disclose is not guaranteed; you make such Postings and disclosures at your own risk. We are not responsible for any errors, omissions, or offensive material contained in any content posted in any public areas or any decisions made or actions taken or not taken based on such information or content.

**Accuracy and Confidentiality**

It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep the Personal Information that you provide to us up to date. **We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give us.**

You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your user name and password, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Site, by any others who use your user name or password, unless and until you notify us that your user name or password may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites and third parties. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Site and our web-based newsletters or other communications which you may choose to receive. Often these third party advertisers employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information. **_This Privacy Policy Statement does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party advertiser or ad server may collect from you._** We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. Use of advertisers’ tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.

**Security**

We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.

**Phishing**

Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use “spoofed” e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and Social Security Numbers. **WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!** If you receive such e-mail communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at ohp.manager@onehanesplace.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent e-mail from your computer.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We may use a technology called "cookies" to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that the Site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so our Site can recognize you as you browse the Site and when you return. These cookies may collect the type of operating system and browser that you are using, and accumulate and report anonymous, statistical information on Site usage. The use of cookies shows how our customers navigate through our web site and thus allows us to make our Site more responsive to your needs, by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. We do not use cookies to identify or track any Personal Information. If you do not wish to have a cookie sent to your browser, you can change the settings on your Internet browser to stop it from automatically accepting cookies. While rejecting a cookie will not normally affect your browsing or your ability to access the features on our Site, you may be required to re-enter certain information when you browse or when you return to the Site. If you are experiencing trouble browsing our site, it is possible that you did not accept or have configured your browser to block cookies from the Site.

We also may use electronic image requests (also called "web beacons" or "single-pixel gifs") to count page views and to access cookies. The web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any Personal Information; they are used only to compile anonymous information about Site usage.

We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our advertisers, except in the limited circumstances listed below. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to advertisers, we ask for you to opt-in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the advertisers’ own privacy policies.
