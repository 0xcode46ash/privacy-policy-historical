Office Roaming ServiceOffice Roaming Service

The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Office settings up to date across devices running Office. When you sign into Office with your Microsoft account or with the user ID you use to access Office 365, the Office Roaming Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Office settings to Microsoft servers. When you sign into Office on another device with the same Microsoft account or user ID you use to access Office 365, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Office settings when you sign into Office.com.

When you sign into Office for iPad with a Microsoft account or with the user ID you use to access Office 365, the Office Roaming Service syncs the following Office settings with Microsoft servers. 

  * List of most recently used documents
  * Last location viewed within a document



We use this data to provide the Office Roaming Service.

For more information about your privacy and Microsoft account, see the Microsoft account Privacy Statement. If you work in an organization, your administrator can turn off the Office Roaming Service via Group Policy. When you sign out of Office, the Office Roaming Service removes your Office settings from the device. Any changes you made to your customized Office settings are sent to Microsoft servers.

Office 365 Education for Students ProgramO365 Students Program

The Office 365 Education for Students program uses your educational institution account (e.g. your student email). When managed directly by Microsoft, this privacy statement applies. Since this is an educational institution account, the owner of the educational institute domain (e.g., your school) may subsequently be able to assume control of your account and obtain access to your data and prior network activities. If this happens, this privacy statement will no longer apply to you, and you should direct any privacy-related inquiries to your school's network administrator.

OneDriveOneDrive

Some versions of this application enables users to access both their OneDrive for Business on their organization’s SharePoint tenancy and their OneDrive on their Microsoft Account storage. 

**OneDrive:** OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others.

When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you store content in a public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the Internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private. By default, content stored in OneDrive is private unless you share it or store it in a public folder. 

**OneDrive for Business:**

The OneDrive for Business functionality is designed to enable users to access their OneDrive for Business on their organization’s Microsoft SharePoint tenancy. When you store content in OneDrive for Business, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. The OneDrive for Business application collects and transmits personally identifiable information, such as the user’s email and password, for authentication purposes only, as described in the app documentation. If you use SharePoint Online, Microsoft processes personally identifiable information as a data processor. Please contact your organization’s administrator for more detail.
