_Last updated November 29, 2010_

### Our commitment to privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy we provide this statement to explain our information practices and to define your options for how your information is collected and used. 

SpotMixer, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site at [http://www.OneTrueMedia.com](http://www.onetruemedia.com/). Because this website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Privacy Officer at customercare@onetruemedia.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns. 

By using the One True Media service, you agree to the collection and use of information in the manner described below. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, by means of a notice the next time you log in to our site, or by means of a notice on our homepage. To make our privacy policy easy to find, we have placed it on our homepage and at the bottom of each web page.

### The information we collect 

This policy applies to all information collected on the One True Media website, via email, and by phone.

You provide personal information to us when you register as a One True Media member, create Video Montage, order products, and request information from us. The personal information we collect includes:

  * User ID
  * Password
  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Credit/debit card information
  * Items purchased
  * Your digital content and related titles, captions, and annotations



You may also submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift and send it directly to the recipient, you will submit the recipient's name and address. In this circumstance, we collect the following information about the recipient:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number



When you share your Montage and photos online, we collect the email addresses of the guests you have invited to share.

To personalize our website and to improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, and experiences with our products or services. Providing this additional information is optional.

In addition to the personal information you supply, we automatically collect non-personal information to evaluate how visitors, guests, and members use the One True Media website. This non-personal information is not associated with your identity.

We collect non-personal data to make our service work better for you in the following ways: to improve the design of our website, to provide personalization on our website, and to evaluate the performance of our marketing programs. The technologies we use to gather this non-personal information include IP addresses, cookies, clear gifs, browser detection, and weblogs. We define how these technologies are used under “How we use information” below.

### How we use information 

Our primary goal in collecting your customer information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, and positive experience with One True Media. We use the personal information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete your order only. One True Media will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others, except to the extent necessary to fulfill your order.

We use the information you provide about other people when placing an order for a gift item only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to fulfill that order. 

We may combine personal data collected online with information you have provided us through other sources, such as our sales and customer care staff, or public events such as trade shows or seminars.

We use your email address to answer email we receive from you and to provide status updates for One True Media projects. We will not share your email address with outside parties.

As a registered member of One True Media, you can invite guests to view your montages, photos, and video online. When you do, we will send an email with the URL to your content to your list of guests. Please note that your guests can then forward that email to other parties, if they choose. We use the email addresses you provide only to facilitate your montage and photo sharing and for no other purpose; we will not disclose these addresses to any third parties.

You can register on our website to receive promotions and updates on new products and services, or to be contacted for market research purposes. The contact information you submit will not be used for these purposes unless you specifically opt in. You can control your privacy preferences regarding such marketing communications (see the section below entitled “Your privacy preferences and opting out”).

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or contests, and One True Media may request that you provide some or all of the above listed personal information in those surveys or contests. We use information collected through contests to contact winners and award prizes. We use information collected from surveys to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers.

One True Media uses IP addresses, cookies, clear gifs, browser detection, and weblogs to provide a better experience on our website and to give us useful business information. Third party technologies such as cookies may also be used for the same purposes. None of the data derived from these technologies is tied to your personally identifiable information.

IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our members and manage the performance of our website. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit our website, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to the site and deliver content specific to your interests. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies.

We also use a technology called clear gifs. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that are used to track emails and online movements, helping us understand what marketing campaigns and content are effective.

We detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance of our website and to understand the mix of browsers used by our visitors, guests, and members. To learn about how people use our site, we examine weblogs, which show the paths people take through our site and how long they spend in certain areas.

Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above, without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out.

### Our commitment to data security 

Access to your data is limited to authorized One True Media staff and restricted by password protection mechanisms. We process all orders on a secure server that encrypts all financial information through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). You’ll know this security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.

We will not store your credit card information in our database unless you instruct us to or join as a member. Credit card numbers are used for processing payments only and for no other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, our online transaction partner uses fraud management techniques. This service gives you and One True Media an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud.

### Our commitment to children's privacy 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we have structured no part of our website or marketing programs to attract anyone under 13.

### Your privacy preferences and opting out

When you sign up for an account with One True Media, you may begin receiving marketing communications such as e-mail newsletters, product and service updates, promotions, and contests. Our customers generally find this type of information useful. If you do not want to receive these updates, you must opt-out by unchecking the “Add me to the mailing list” box on the registration page, or should you choose to opt-out after registering, you can use any of the following three methods:

  * Select the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email and follow the opt-out instructions 
  * Go to your member page, select Manage Account, then select Change Email Preferences and de-select the appropriate box 
  * Send email to unsubscribe@onetruemedia.com from the email account that receives the unwanted messages 



### How to access or correct your information 

You can access and maintain your personally identifiable information on your Account Information page. To protect your privacy and security, we require a Member ID and password to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

### Legal disclaimer 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

### How to contact us 

We value your opinion about our privacy policy. Should you have questions or concerns, please call our Customer Care line at 1-866-MY1TRUE (1-866-691-8783), send an email to [customercare@onetruemedia.com](mailto:customercare@onetruemedia.com), or mail One True Media, 2694-A Middlefield Road, Redwood City, CA 94063.
