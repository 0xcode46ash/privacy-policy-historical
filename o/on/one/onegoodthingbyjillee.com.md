# Privacy Policy - One Good Thing by Jillee

**One Good Thing By Jillee Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy of One Good Thing By Jillee, LLC. (“JILLEE”) describes the information we gather, how we use that information, and what we do to protect your information on our website, [www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/).

Use of the site indicates agreement with this privacy policy. This privacy policy was last updated Sept 2013.

**What Information Do We Gather?**

Information we automatically collect via industry standard web log files includes the URL from which you visited, the page you are visiting, your computer browser information and your IP address. We may also use automatic data collection devices such as “cookies” and “clear GIFs” (also known as “pixel tags” or “beacons”).

Cookies contain specific pieces of information on your computer hard drive, and can be set to store information during a visit or for a longer period of time. Cookies are also used to help streamline your experience on the site, automatically logging you in during future visits, for example. You are free to disable cookies at any time if your browser permits. However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features of our site.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message. A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We do not collect personally identifiable information in this way, but if you provide us with personally identifiable information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically.  
As a user of our site and potential customer of featured products, to receive information from or about sellers, you will be working through that seller’s website or a marketplace-type website such as Amazon.com or Paypal.com or others in order to complete the transactions. These transactions occur outside the scope of the JILLEE website and will be subject to that third-party’s Privacy Policy.

We also require you to provide certain information when you request our newsletters or other content or submit information for posting on public areas of this site (e.g., comments sections).  
Additionally, we may request that you provide demographic information. The specific information requested varies according to the different types of content you may request.

Some of the materials included on this site, including advertising, may be served by third parties. These third parties, in the course of serving such materials, may collect information regarding your use of this site and how you respond to e-mail communications, using methods that may include automatic data collection, and may use this information in order to present advertisements or other content that may be of interest to you on both this site and other web sites. Collection, use, disclosure and security of information collected by third parties are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by certain third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, [contact us](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/contact).

**How Do We Use Your Information?**

JILLEE uses the information we gather to put its followers in contact with awesome companies offering great products and for other purposes described in this policy, and for purposes disclosed to you when you provide information.

**Analysis.** In our ongoing effort to improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Third party companies may be used to analyze the data for optimal usage and targeted advertising. Your personal information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.

**Testimonials and Feedback.** We sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. Your feedback, both positive and negative, is reviewed so we can continue to monitor and improve the information we provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature but will do so without including personally identifiable information unless we have expressly received your permission to do so. If you would like your testimonial removed, please [contact us](http://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/contact).

**Newsletters.** JILLEE offers valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. If you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of these communications by clicking “unsubscribe” on any of the Newsletter emails.

**Other communications.** JILLEE may send you email and other communications related to this site, your use of our site and the status of your account, which may include site updates and responses to your inquiries. In addition, JILLEE may send periodic surveys and other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing your notification preferences as described below.

**Third Party Offers.** We also may use your information to send you e-mails or newsletters on behalf of third parties. Each of these communications will include instructions for opting out of receiving future third party offers from us.

**Do We Share Your Information With Others?**

Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we will not disclose your information with third parties. Rather, JILLEE creates and maintains relationships with third parties interested in reaching out to JILLEE followers and this third party information is added in JILLEE newsletters. Any communication will be facilitated through JILLEE and not by a third party affiliate. Should a JILLEE customer choose to purchase a product or service from a third party affiliate, that transaction is outside the scope or control of JILLEE and the company does not warrant any transactions between third party affiliates and JILLEE customers. While JILLEE does not share your information with third-parties for marketing purposes, it reserves the right to share user-behavior data with third-parties as described above through the use of “cookies” and other tracking mechanisms.

**Legal Requests.**

JILLEE is interested in protecting its members and the community at large. We will release account and other personal information to legal authorities when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, rules or regulations or to protect persons or property. In addition, JILLEE may choose to release information about you to relevant parties in relation to investigations of fraud, piracy or other unlawful activity.

**Information Security**

Any personal identifiable information you share with us is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized access through the use of safeguards such as “firewalls,” encryption and/or Secure Socket Layers. We utilize many security techniques to protect your personal information. However, it is impossible to guarantee a perfect security system.

**Data Retention.**

We will retain your information to continue sending you newsletters to offer you products and services. Please contact us if you wish to cancel or request that we no longer use your information this way. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Children**

We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If it is discovered that we have collected personally identifiable information from someone under 13 we will delete that information immediately. Persons under the age of 18 are not eligible to receive One JILLEE newsletter.

**Widgets**

Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.

**Public Forums**

Our Website offers publicly accessible comment sections. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from a comment section, please contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Legal Disclaimer**

Although we have attempted to address the various privacy-related issues you are likely to encounter, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private from unauthorized access.

Also, JILLEE contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies to information collected by JILLEE alone.
