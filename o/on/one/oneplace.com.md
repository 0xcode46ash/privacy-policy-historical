# OnePlace.com - Privacy Policy

| 

At OnePlace.com we strive to bring you the most compelling Christian audio content available on the Internet. It is our goal to keep you, the listeners, completely satisfied with our site and what we have to offer. In order to keep up with the most current developments in the Christian community, we may occasionally need to disclose information about our listeners to select third-party vendors. Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we use the information we collect about you (collectively "Your Information"). 

Information Disclosure   
OnePlace.com reserves the right to provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party vendors. Generally, these statistics will include no personal identifying information. OnePlace.com may also release Your Information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law and law enforcement officials, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of our Terms of Use, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of OnePlace.com, our users, or others. Also, some or all of Your Information may be turned over to third-party vendors who assist us in fulfilling some of the functions of this Web site. Finally, we may provide Your Information to third parties if you authorize us to do so. 

Required Information   
When you sign up for our OnePlace.com email newsletter, we require your email address. This allows us to send the newsletter and notify you about changes and/or upgrades to our site. We may also use this information for basic research and development related to our site. Occasionally OnePlace.com will pass this list to select vendors who we trust to provide products or services that may be of interest to our audience. 

Voluntary Information

**Surveys**   
OnePlace.com features an optional [Listener Survey](https://web.archive.org/About_Us/Listener_Survey/), in which we ask for personally identifiable information. We may also post additional surveys to help us gather facts and information about our audience. These surveys are completely optional and if you choose to fill them out, please understand that the information you provide will be used by OnePlace.com and may be provided to third parties. Ways in which we may use information gathered in the surveys include: 

  * To send you information about OnePlace.com 
  * To give to select ministries on our site, who may send you promotional material 
  * To give to our advertisers, who may send you information about their products and services 



**Contests and Sweepstakes**   
OnePlace.com runs a daily [Giveaway](https://web.archive.org/GiveAway/), as well as other occasional contests and sweepstakes, in which we ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, age, email address, and telephone number. We may also request additional optional information such as gender, marital status, and income level. These contests are completely voluntary, and information given may be entered upon the discretion of the entrant. We may then use this information: 

  * To determine contest eligibility 
  * To notify winners 
  * To view statistics and conduct basic research 
  * To send you information about OnePlace.com 
  * To give to select ministries on our site, who may send you promotional material

Such consent may be given when a parent fills out and signs the [OnePlace Parental Consent Form](https://web.archive.org/About_Us/ParentalConsentForm.asp), and then returns the form via United States mail or facsimile. 

If a parent wishes to refuse to permit collection or use of their child's information by OnePlace.com, that parent can send an email to [feedback@oneplace.com](mailto:feedback@oneplace.com) to request deletion of their child's account.
