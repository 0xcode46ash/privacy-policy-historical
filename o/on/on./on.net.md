# Internode - SFOA - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy 

**This is Internode's Privacy Policy, which forms part of Internode's[Standard Form of Agreement](https://web.archive.org/sfoa/index.htm) (the definitions for the terms used in this Policy are contained in Internode's Standard Form of Agreement).**

  1. We may, in our discretion, retain and access any data or information concerning your use of the Services.
  2. Where we hold information that you lodge with us (for transmission or web hosting) we will make back-up copies of your information. However, we do not guarantee successful restoration of your information lodged on our servers in the unlikely event of loss of that information (due, for instance, to a catastrophic hardware failure). It is your responsibility to ensure that you keep back-up copies of all information that you lodge with us.
  3. We will not disclose personal information or any other information or data held by us about you to a third party unless: 
    1. we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, and we disclose this information as a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities;
    2. we are required or specifically permitted by or under law to provide this information to an authority or person that is duly authorised to request it;
    3. a court order compels us to disclose this information to a specified recipient; or
    4. we are otherwise required or specifically permitted by law to disclose this information.
  4. We will not use or disclose your credit report or any personal information derived from that report unless we are required or specifically permitted to do so under Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988 or the Credit Reporting: Code of Conduct.
  5. You acknowledge that we must cooperate with the lawful requests of members of the police force or any other person duly authorised to investigate breaches of the law, and that we may disclose any information held by us in relation to your account to such authorities if compelled or required to do so.
  6. We draw your attention to the ACIF Calling Number Display Code of Practice, which can be viewed at <http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.393554:STANDARD:550353612:pc=PC_2096>.
  7. This Industry Code requires carriage service providers to inform their customers that they receive Calling Line Identification ("CLI") information in many circumstances where the customer would expect this to not occur.
  8. Internode receives this CLI information in most cases which means we know the phone number you call us from when you make a modem or ISDN call to connect to the Internet even if you have a silent number or use 'per call blocking'.
  9. We would like to reassure customers that we will only disclose your personal information as set out in this Policy.
