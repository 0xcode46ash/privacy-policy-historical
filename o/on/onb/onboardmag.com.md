We may also use information supplied by you to perform in-house statistical analysis for marketing reasons â€“ although no information that can single out an individual will ever be distributed to a 3rd party.

Your information 

The website contains various data 'opt in' and 'opt out' boxes on the relevant pages where you provide your personal information. We will not use information supplied to us in order to contact you by telephone or post where you have opted out of being contacted and by e-mail where you have not opted in to be contacted. Your personal information will only be passed to reputable third parties where you have not opted out of being contacted by such organisations.

  * IP address 
  * Computer platform 
  * Web browser used
