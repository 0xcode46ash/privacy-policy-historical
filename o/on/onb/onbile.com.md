ONBILE Service requires a Login in order to provide you with a personalized account. During our account registration process, we will collect a login name, password, and an email address from you.

You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.

If you choose to continue service with ONBILE via a paid account, ONBILE will collect personally identifiable information (credit card number, billing address, phone number) and keep this information on file in our secure server in order to process your recurring invoices. This information is only used to verify credit card authenticity, and issue invoices as per your service agreement.

We will never contact addresses logged in this manner. The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.

    4. **Hosted websites**

Users hosting websites with ONBILE are given tools that may ask you optionally enter your email address when making comments on their website, or contacting them through their website.

In addition, once in our system, website owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their website.
