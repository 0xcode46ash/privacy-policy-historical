**The information we collect.**

  * Whenever you shop our online store, at the time of check-out, we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction. To process your order, we require you to supply us with your correct billing, shipping and contact information. The transfer of this information is secure and cannot be received or read by others. 
  * We also allow you to register to receive periodic email correspondence from us. The information we collect for this purpose is your name and your email address. 



**How we use the information we collect.**   
We use the personal information you supply to complete and ship your order. Your email address is used to send you an order confirmation, as well as to alert you to any changes in the availability of the items you ordered. 

  * **Email messages.**  
If you provide permission, we will send occasional email messages to let you know about changes to our Web site, free promotional offers and special discounts on products that we believe will be of interest to you. Email messages also may be sent to invite you to participate in a contest or survey or to provide you with information about a product you have purchased from Ontrack. 
  * **Surveys and Contests.**   
Occasionally, Ontrack requests information through surveys or contests. Requested information may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as your zip code and occupation). Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes, unless you acknowledge that you would like to receive future correspondence (emails, special offers, etc.) from Ontrack. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and is limited to those 18 years or older. 
  * **Affiliate Program.**  
Our Affiliate Program (STAR) is administered by a third party, on a third party's web site. Any information collected by them is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
