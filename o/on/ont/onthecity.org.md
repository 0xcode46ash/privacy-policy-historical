# Privacy | Church Software | The City by Zondervan

Zondervan (“Zondervan” or the “Company” operates the website onthecity.org (the “Site” or “The City”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share personal information we have obtained about you. It also describes how that information is secured and your choices regarding our usage of such information.

From time to time Zondervan may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our personal information collection and use practices, the features of the Site or technology. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Zondervan materially changes its practices regarding the collection or use of your personal information, your personal information will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.

###  What information does Zondervan collect and how is the information used?

Zondervan collects and uses User Information gathered online. When users visit The City, they provide Zondervan with two types of information: 1) personal information the User knowingly chooses to disclose, and 2) site use information that is logged as users interact with The City. When users register for The City, they provide Zondervan with certain personal information, such as a name, email address, telephone number, address, gender, and other personal or preference information.

When users enter The City, Zondervan collects their browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all visitors to The City. In addition, Zondervan stores certain information from the User’s browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User’s computer, and is tied to information about the User. Zondervan uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the User closes the browser. You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely; however, this may disable some of the functionality we have designed for you on the Site.

When users interact with The City, they may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels. Zondervan collects this information so that it can provide users the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, Zondervan retains information so that, for instance, users can return to view sent messages or easily view contact lists. When users update their information, Zondervan usually keeps a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior iteration of that information.

Users can post User Content (as defined in the The City Terms of Use) on the Site at their own risk. Although Zondervan allows users to set privacy options that limit access to personal pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Zondervan cannot control the actions of others with whom users may choose to share pages and information. Therefore, the Company cannot and does not guarantee that User Content posted on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Zondervan is not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. Users understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or by way of copies made or stored by other users.

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on The City is a violation of the Terms of Use and should be reported to Zondervan. The City may also collect information about a User from other reputable sources, such as other users of the Site or information provided to Zondervan in other contexts. However, any personal information about you collected from these sources will be subject to this Policy.

The Site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Zondervan or The City logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Zondervan. The Site may also carry advertisements from other companies. Zondervan is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to the Site or for the privacy practices of such third parties. Once you've left a the Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any personal information they collect from you.

Zondervan will not use the personal information collected from you for purposes different from the purposes for which the personal information was submitted.

###  How User Information May Be Shared

When users register with The City, they create an individual profile and set personal privacy settings. Certain profile information such as name, physical address, and groups of which the User is a member, is visible to other users depending upon personal privacy settings.

Profile information is used by The City primarily to be presented back to the User and may be edited whenever the User accesses the service. Profile information is presented to others based on your personal privacy settings. In some cases, as your personal privacy settings allow, users of The City may be able to supplement another’s profile.

Profile information submitted to The City will be available to users of The City who share at least one group in common (e.g., campus or community group), and in accordance with personal privacy settings. The User’s name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across The City network.

The City may send users service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a user receives a private message on The City, he or she may receive an email alerting them to that fact. Generally, users may opt out of such emails, though The City reserves the right to send notices about a user’s account, even if the User has opted out of all voluntary email notifications.

The City is an extension of the physical body of believers at The City. Although one does not have to be a member of The City to use The City, by participating in The City community, the User submits himself or herself to the spiritual authority of The City. The User agrees that The City, in addition to other rights, has the right, but not the duty, to communicate with other people within the body (whether members or non-members) regarding issues of common concern. Therefore the User agrees that The City, in its discretion and exercise of its spiritual authority, may take such action (including church discipline) regarding participation in The City and involvement in The City as it deems necessary for the welfare of The City, its members, and other participants in its community.

Zondervan’s employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personal information. Zondervan may share your personal information with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide Zondervan with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

There may be instances when Zondervan discloses personal information without providing you with a choice. For example, Zondervan may disclose such information to protect the legal rights of Zondervan, and its affiliated companies or their respective employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to the Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process, such as subpoenas or court orders. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, government agencies, or members of The City. In addition, if Zondervan sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Zondervan may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of that transaction.

###  Your choices regarding our use of information

Access and control over personal information on The City is readily available through the profile editing tools. Users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their account may do so by contacting the community lead. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to other users of The City. Where users engage the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on The City, however (e.g., sending a personal message to another user), such correspondence and communication generally cannot be removed.

###  Security

Zondervan uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard personal information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification and requires its internet service provider to store all such information on a secure server. In addition, Zondervan uses reasonable methods to make sure that personal information collected is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords and personal information are stored by Zondervan behind firewalls. Credit card information is encrypted both in transit and when stored within Zondervan’s online databases.

If you wish to stop all future communications from Zondervan, please contact [[privacypolicy@harpercollins.com](mailto:privacypolicy@harpercollins.com)](mailto:privacypolicy@harpercollins.com) requesting that your PII be permanently removed from any HarperCollins database. We will send you a written confirmation of such removal.
