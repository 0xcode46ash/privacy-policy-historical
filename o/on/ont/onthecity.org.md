ACS Technologies will not release, sell, or rent the personally identifiable information of its clients or prospects. We comply with all United States state and federal privacy and security laws.

  1. ###  Hosted & Web-Based Services

This section highlights our privacy practices for clients of ACS Technologies hosted and Web-based services and covers the following points:

    * What personally identifiable information is collected and how the information is used
    * With whom the personally identifiable information may be shared
    * How privacy policy changes are communicated
    * What choices are available to you regarding the communication you receive from us
    * How you can correct any inaccuracies in your hosted services registration information

####  Information Collection & Use

Several of ACS Technologies solutions require the client to use a Web-based registration form for clients to activate their service. We collect client contact information (such as first name, last name, phone number, email address, and username). Contact information from the registration form is used to create records in our database(s) that are necessary to establish the service, send information related to updates and revisions, and inform the client about pertinent information of their service.

ACS Technologies maintains the right to email/contact active clients for the purpose of administering services. For operational purposes, records created in some of our databases include the establishment of a password used in conjunction with the service username. Upon registration, username and password are communicated by email to the email address given on the registration form.

####  Client Forums

ACS Technologies is not responsible for any personal identification information that clients disclose through the use of ACS Technologies services or online forums. ACS Technologies strongly discourages forum participants from including personal identification information in their interaction with other clients.

####  Partners

ACS Technologies may share personally identifiable information with our partners for the purpose of providing the service. For example, we may use an outside shipping company or a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When a client places an order or signs up for a service, names or other contact information that is necessary to provide these services may be shared between the parties. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their specific service(s).

ACS Technologies does reserve the right to analyze the data in order to provide a better client experience and overall solution.

####  Notification of Changes

If any changes are to be made in the privacy or security practices for our hosted and Web-based solutions, we will, 30 days prior to the changes taking effect, send a notification to the email address on record for the client and post the changes in our privacy statement on our corporate Web page.
