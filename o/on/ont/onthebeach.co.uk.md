# Cheap Holidays | Holiday Deals in 2014 & 2015 | On the Beach

And we'll send over 1 million beach loving sun-seekers on holiday. Here are a few reasons why.

  


We're proud to say that back in 2011 we were the first major online travel agent to create an ATOL approved trust, and in 2015 we'll financially protect over 1 million customers' holidays.

That means, when booked together, your flight, hotel and transfer are all financially protected. [Read more](https://web.archive.org/book-with-confidence).

Book your holiday from as little as £50 per person deposit, and your final payment will only be due two weeks before you fly. [Read more](https://web.archive.org/flexible-payments)

Every month we price check against the big high street travel agents, and every month we come out substantially cheaper for the same holidays - sometimes half the price.

You don't have to take our word for it though. We publish all of our price checked holidays on our [Beat the High Street](https://web.archive.org/beat-the-high-street) page.

We're an online travel agent - we don't sell package holidays. Instead, we let you build your perfect getaway by letting you search thousands of cheap flights, hotels and transfer suppliers in one place, saving you money. 

That means you get everything you want from a holiday, without paying for the bits that you don't.
