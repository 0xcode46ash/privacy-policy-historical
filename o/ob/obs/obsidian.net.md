# Privacy Policy

## Online Privacy Policy

Obsidian Entertainment, Inc. (“Obsidian”) respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Web site, [www.obsidian.net](http://www.obsidian.net/) (the “Site”).  Obsidian thus provides this privacy statement to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the Site and how such information may be used.

Please also review the [Terms of Use](http://www.obsidian.net/use.html) which also governs your use of this Web Site.

As a general policy no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Site. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of Obsidian’s internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience.

The Site’s forums, various mailing lists, downloads, special offers, contests, registration forms, and surveys may request that you give us contact information such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address; demographic information such as your age and gender; and personal preference information such as your tastes in video game platforms and gameplay. Information submitted at the time of submission will be used by Obsidian only as necessary for our legitimate business interests, including without limitation the improvement of our products, services and the contents of the Site.  Obsidian may also share such information with our business and promotional partners to further those interests. Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our company and products. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings as provided below.   
Obsidian may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Obsidian’s rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

Obsidian recognizes the special obligation to protect personally identifiable information obtained from children age 12 and under.  AS SUCH, IF YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER, OBSIDIAN REQUESTS THAT YOU NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE SITE OR TO OBSIDIAN.  If Obsidian discovers that a child age 12 or younger has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our records.

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make using our Site easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. These cookies are restricted for use only on our Site, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  Please consult the technical information relevant to your browser for instructions. If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of the Site may not function properly or may be considerably slower.

Obsidian is not responsible for the content or practices of third party Web sites that may be linked to the Site. Obsidian is also not responsible for any information that you might share with such linked Web sites.  You should refer to each such Web site’s respective privacy policy and practices prior to disclosing any such information.

Guests of the Site are solely responsible for the content of messages they post on public forums, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people.

The Site may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us at the point where we request information about you. You always have the option of removing your name from any e-mail list in order to discontinue any such future communications. In order to ensure immediate removal from any list, please follow the specific instructions set forth within the communications you receive from Obsidian which you no longer wish to receive. If you are unsuccessful in completing the instructions specified in any such communication, please e-mail us at [info@obsidian.net](mailto:info@obsidian.net), including a copy of the undesired email attached to the request, and state you wish to be removed from the mailing list.

Information provided by you via general e-mail inquiries to Obsidian such as your e-mail address is used only to respond to your inquiries in the ordinary course of business, and is never shared with third parties. 

Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Obsidian cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit via the internet.  By transmitting any such information to Obsidian, you accept that you do so at your own risk.
