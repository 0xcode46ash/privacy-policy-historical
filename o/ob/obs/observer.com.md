**What Information Do We Collect?   **

One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this Website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Website and our services.   Also, when you subscribe or register to the Website, we will ask you to set preferences so that you can determine how we may or may not use your information. 

**Personal Information**

You can access our Website and use many of our services without providing any information at all.   In certain circumstances, we may collect certain information that identifies you, such as your name, address or credit card information, as well as other individually-identifiable information that you provide to us or that we collect ("Personal Information").   We may collect this Personal Information from you only during (i) contest or sweepstakes registration, (ii) subscription registration for services that require a subscription; (iii) chat room and blog talk back participation; and (iv) online shopping.   Registration may be required and Personal Information may be collected in certain portions of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g. community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or customer service requests. 

**Anonymous Information**

Through your use of the Website, we may also gather certain information that does not identify you individually ("Anonymous Information").   Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" and may involve the use of "Cookies," "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.  

**Newsletters**

In the event that we distribute newsletters or RSS feeds, we collect e-mail addresses and may collect zip codes and other information of all users who subscribe to these publications.   Anyone who wishes to stop receiving this newsletter can, at any time, click on the "Unsubscribe" feature located within each newsletter. 

**Advertiser Giveaways and Contests**

If you sign up to be eligible for a giveaway or contest on our Website sponsored or co-sponsored by someone other than us, your Personal Information will be shared with the advertiser or sponsor of that giveaway or contest for one-time use to notify you if you have won.   To the extent the giveaway or contest has its own terms that conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms of the giveaway or contest will govern the use of your Personal Information.   Such Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us. 

**Policies for Children Under 13**

We do not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 13. If we learn that any persons under the age of 13 have provided information about themselves, the information will be deleted. Our Website is designed for adults. Our Website is not intentionally targeted to children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Website without obtaining prior parental consent.  

**Co-Branded Services**

We work closely with our partners to offer co-branded services. For privacy policies governing these types of services, please see the separate privacy policies within these sections. To the extent such policies conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms of such other policy shall govern. 

**Use of Cookies and Spyware**

We may use Cookies to provide some of the services on our Website. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our website. The use of "Cookies" is standard in the Internet industry, and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their users. "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.   Our website never uses "Cookies" to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a "Cookie."   Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not use information transferred through "Cookies" for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. We do not use Cookies" to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping and contest registration (where a "Cookie" allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). You may occasionally get "Cookies" from our advertisers. We do not control these "Cookies," and these "Cookies" are not subject to our "Cookie" policy.  

We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer. 

**How We Use Your Information?**

Except as disclosed in this Security and Privacy Policy, we do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to our Website or your Personal Information collected online to any companies not affiliated with us. We are, however, constantly striving to enhance the quality and selection of the products and services that we offer to you. As a result, we may share information, including Personal Information, about you with retailers, direct marketers, and others that we select in an effort to make you aware of additional products and services that may be of interest to you. If we plan to permit such use of your Personal Information, you may instruct us not to allow such contact.  

**Feedback**

We may use your Personal Information to fulfill prizes, track your compliance with the Website's rules and regulations, or for editorial and feedback purposes. In the event we plan to publicly post any of your Personal Information on a Website (as, for instance, a letter to the editor), you are given the option of preventing such posting. 

**Use of Anonymous Information**

We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our readers are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the observer.com website. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. 

**Third-party Agents**

We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf, such as credit card processing, shipping or stocking orders, providing customer service, etc. These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Website.  

**Transactional partners**

In some cases we partner with another company to co-promote their services within our Website. In these cases, you are transacting directly with the other party, and the Personal Information you enter on those services is shared both with that transactional partner and us.   On those pages requiring Personal Information, the transactional partner's brand is clearly visible, and their privacy policy is posted.   We encourage you to read it. 

**Emergency Situations**

We may also disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, the users of the Website or the public. 

**Links to Other Websites**

This Privacy Policy applies only to The New York Observer website and websites that carry our brand, not to other companies' or organizations' websites to which we link.   These links include links from advertisers, sponsors and partners and are beyond our control.   These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect your data or solicit your personal information. Always be aware of where you end up.   We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with any other website.  

**Security Policy**

The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with you is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers.   Personal Information collected by our websites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In many instances, such as in the case of credit card numbers and all on-line purchases, the Personal Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction. Only those employees who need access to your Personal Information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed confidentiality agreements. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 

While we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.   As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or information we transmit to you from our Website, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Public Areas, Chat Rooms and Newsgroups**

Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public, and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you choose to make public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any Personal Information that you expect to keep private. 

**Assignment**

We may change its ownership or corporate organization while providing the website and services. As a result, please be aware that we may transfer your information to another company that is affiliated with us or with which we have merged. Any new company will also follow this Privacy Policy. 

**Changes**

We are committed to maintaining its position as a premier Website on the Internet. As our Website continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our Website. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.   We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.   We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.
