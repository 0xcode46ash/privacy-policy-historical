Privacy Policy

Updated September 1, 2015

At OPPO, we understand your concerns regarding the privacy of the information you share with us. We are firmly committed to your privacy. We will not sell, rent, or share any of your personal information to others that is in any way different than what is described in this privacy policy. We encourage you to take a moment to read the following policy that describes how we handle and use your personal information.

The personal information we collect from you is used for the processing of your order. This information is needed for security purposes when processing your credit card and for shipping purposes so we know where to send your order to. On occasion, OPPO may choose to keep you up to date with the latest product announcements, special offers, and any other information we think may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of being kept updated, please let us know and we will update our records accordingly. It is also OPPO's policy not to share any personal information with any partners or third parties.

Our customers' personal information is safeguarded via electronic, physical and managerial procedures. The OPPO Digital Store uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect your information as it travels from your computer to our server. Furthermore, your credit card information is collected by PayPal's secure servers; we do not collect nor store any credit card information on our servers.

Our online store employs a web technology called "cookies", which is used to facilitate shopping on the store and process your orders. These cookies do not contain any personal information about you.

Our website also uses Google Analytics, which also uses cookies to help analyze how users use our site. Google Analytics stores information about which pages users visit, how long users are on the site, how users find or visit our site, and the links users click on our site. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site, and is not connected to any of your personally identifiable information. We therefore do not use any of this data to collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address), so this information cannot be used to identify who you are or connect it to your IP address. We have activated Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorizes visitors on our site for age, gender, and interest data if such data have been made available to Google. We use this information to create content and advertisements relevant to our users. If you would prefer not to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) by installing a plugin for your browser that keeps Google Analytics from tracking you further.

Our privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. We encourage you to visit this page for any updates.
