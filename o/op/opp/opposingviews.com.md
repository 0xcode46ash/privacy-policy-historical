# Privacy Policy

Opposing Views and Deep Dive Media, LLC, and its affiliates ["The Company"] takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the information that is collected from you when you visit [OpposingViews.com](http://www.opposingviews.com/), the mobile application, and any other affiliated Opposing Views owned or operated web sites or applications ("The Sites"). This policy documents how this information may be used and disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected. Note that our [Terms of Use](http://www.opposingviews.com/terms) also apply to anyone who uses this site.

If you use Opposing Views mobile applications or sites, our [Mobile Terms of Services](http://www.opposingviews.com/mobile-terms) also applies.

This policy tells you how The Sites collect, use, and protect your information. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that Opposing Views does not control. Please note that The Sites may contain links to other web sites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on one of our Sites and link to another website, then this privacy policy will not apply to any information collected on that website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of every website that you visit.

We are not in the business of renting or selling personal information you provide to The Sites with other people or nonaffiliated companies. Opposing Views does share your information to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, and under the following circumstances:

  * We may share your information with service providers under confidentiality agreements in order to help with our business operations. These companies do not have the independent right to share this information.
  * We may share names and e-mails of members who join Opposing Views as part of a co-branded partnership with that specific partner.

Such aggregate information is not traceable back to you as an individual.
  * We may share information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law; to comply with legal process served upon Opposing Views; to protect the property or interests of Opposing Views; or to protect personal safety or public interests.
  * We may transfer personal information in the event that our business is sold, transferred, merged, or reorganized with or into another organization.



### 6\. Public Content

Some portions of The Sites allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, comments, and other content to The Sites. This content is displayed publicly to other users, Opposing Views, and our partners. The content you contribute may be displayed with your Opposing Views screen name.

Some portions of The Sites utilize Facebook or other third-party services that allow users to comment and make statments that may or may not relate to the content on The Sites. The Company does not assume any responsibility for any offense or action that may arise from the use of these services or for any information that may be collected through the use of these services.

We may use this public content, whether submitted directly to the site or via third-party services, to develop aggregate ratings, comments, reviews, or other derived content for The Sites and distribution to other web sites and business partners. We may use your public content to personalize the site for you and other members and to identify and feature special content and members. For example, we may promote highly rated and regarded content on The Sites and on partner web sites.

### 7\. Cookies

Opposing Views sets and accesses cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small bit of information used by the site to track your session. It does not contain any sensitive information. No other web sites can access cookies set by The Sites, nor can The Sites access cookies set by other web sites.

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent you from logging in, or may prevent us from delivering some of our services to you.

We may allow third-party advertisers to post advertisements on The Sites. These third parties may place cookies on certain pages of The Sites. We do not control those third parties or their cookies. This privacy policy does not cover third party advertisersâ€™ use of cookies.

### 8\. Links and Third Party Sites and Ads

The Sites contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on these sites. If you have concerns about how other sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read their privacy policies.

We use third party advertising companies to serve ads and collect data on The Sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to The Sites and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this and other web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

### 9\. Confidentiality and Security

We use electronic, physical, and administrative safeguards, including firewalls and advanced password protection, to protect the security of your information. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information and private communications will always remain private.

You should take steps to protect yourself as well. For example:

  * Do not share your password with anyone else, and take measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.
  * To learn more about how to protect yourself online, visit the government website [www.onguardonline.gov](http://www.onguardonline.gov/).



### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this policy from time to time, and we will post the amended terms on The Sites. All amended terms take effect immediately for all users.

To contact us for more information about this privacy policy or how your information is treated, please contact us by email at [admin@opposingviews.com](mailto:legal@opposingviews.com).
