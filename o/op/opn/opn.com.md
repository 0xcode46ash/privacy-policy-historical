This Privacy Policy covers OPN's treatment of personal identifiable information (referred to as “data” below) that may be collected by us on our site. This policy does not apply to content, third parties practices that OPN does not control or own, or to individuals that OPN does not manage or employ.

#### Collection of Data

Our registration process (currently not available) requires only a valid email address and a name. Providing us with other information is your option. Similar to other websites, we may also automatically receive general information contained within our server log files, such as your IP address and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if at all) is set forth below. 

#### Use of Data

OPN may use data to improve and customize your user experience on this site. OPN will make efforts to ensure that your data will not be given to third parties unless (1) Provided otherwise in this (OPN) privacy policy; (2) OPN obtains your consent; (3) A service provided on OPN requires interaction with (or is provided by) a third party, such as, an application service provider; (4) Pursuant to legal process or law enforcement; (5) We find that your use of OPN violates this policy, its terms of service, other guidelines, including usage, or as deemed reasonable and/or necessary for OPN to protect our legal rights and/or property; (6) (or) OPN is purchased by a third party in which that third party shall be able to collect and use data similarly set forth in this policy. In the event links are used that appear on our site that otherwise lead to other websites, you are advised to read the privacy policy that appears on those sites. 

#### Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.

Advertisements may appear (if applicable) on opn.com and, if so, they set/access cookies on your computer machine and are subject to the privacy policy of the parties providing such advertisements. Companies serving the advertising, however, do not have access to OPN’s cookies. These companies usually use non-personally identifiable or anonymous codes to receive and obtain information about your visit to OPN.

Persons under the age of thirteen or younger are not allowed to become members of OPN. For additional information, please contact our webmaster or [jack@niccllc.net](mailto:jack@niccllc.net) .
