Last updated 12th January 2006 

We at OpenCRM and Software Add-ons Limited ("Software Add-ons") are constantly striving to provide excellent service to our customers and business partners, while building long-lasting relationships with them. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our Web site. 

When you visit our Web sites, you may be providing us with information about your visit in two ways: 

  * Statistics collected as you browse. 
  * Organisational and personal information you knowingly give us. 



Because we respects your right to privacy, we want you to be aware of how we handle this information. 

Our Commitment to Your Privacy 

We assure you that we do not: 

  * Sell the names and addresses of our users to outside vendors. 



We  do:

  * Safeguard user information from unauthorised access. 
  * Collect, maintain and use information as necessary to provide targeted products and services to meet user needs. 
  * Honour user requests to be removed from our telephone, fax or mail lists in a timely manner. 
  * Maintain confidentiality of user information when undertaking projects with other companies. 



We have always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organisation. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific Web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please **contact us.**

Information this Site Gathers/Tracks 

## Statistics Collected as You Browse Our Web Site

As you browse the site, our Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: 

  * How many people visit our Web site. 
  * Which pages people visit on our Web site. 
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g. "google.co.uk", "aol.com"). 
  * Which browsers people use to visit our Web site. 



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use. 

## Organisational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us 

Within our Web site, you may be asked to give us personal or organisational information in order to receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your postcode to a specific phone number, email address, mailing address, organisation URL, product serial numbers and control codes, account number or credit card number. 

Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks 

## Your IP Address and Host Name

Our Web site logs Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analysed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content. 

## Registration Forms

We encourage all visitors to register on our Web site, though registration is only required to access premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications, please contact us. 

## Order Forms

Our order forms securely collect contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfil your order. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. 

During the purchasing process, additional information may be added to your profile to make it easier for you to purchase products/services from us in the future. This may include order history and billing information. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing your profile or canceling an online account. 

## Cookies 

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID. We use cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests and to control access to our premium content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on our Web site. 

Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks 

The information you submit may be shared with third parties if it is necessary to complete your request, provide you with access to downloadable software, or as required by law. 

## Information Security

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. When you place an order, the information is encrypted using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
