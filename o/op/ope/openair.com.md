# OpenAir Privacy Statement

| 

**OpenAir Privacy Statement**  
OpenAir, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.OpenAir. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and for internal tracking and monitoring purposes. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies for application functions, login purposes and to deliver content on our Web site that is specific to your interests, but we do not use information from cookies for any marketing purposes, nor do we make that information available to third parties. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will not be able to successfully use the service. In order to login into your OpenAir account and use OpenAir's applications, you must also enable JavaScript on your browser. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, financial information, and demographic information. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes, but in no case will we make your individual information available to any third party. 

You may change or update your information at any time by accessing your account at www.OpenAir. com. 

This site contains links to other sites. OpenAir is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

You may be accessing OpenAir site through one of our co-branding partners. If that is the case, you will also see the brand identity of that partner, and the site will link back to that partner. However, a user's information entered into OpenAir's database will not be accessible to that co-branded partner. Our McAfee Partnership involves a unified registration that allows a McAfee registrant the option of opening an OpenAir account. If the registrant chooses to open an account, they will access OpenAir through a co-branded site using the same password they used to register with McAfee. 

OpenAir has a relationship with Genient Ltd., Jamcracker, Inc., and SmartContractor, whereby OpenAir hosts customer data entered by customers through an account created by the customer on the respective partner site. 

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, you may choose to enable SSL encryption to further protect your information as it is transmitted across the Internet. Importantly, only specific executive-level employees have access to data files, and strict internal security features govern this access. All employees are aware of our security policies, and sign a confidentiality agreement with OpenAir, Inc. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. We communicate with our members to provide information regarding updates to our service, for customer support reasons, and to provide our members with other services and offers. These communications are periodic in nature. Users may opt-out of email communications by replying to any message they receive from OpenAir or by contacting our support department directly. They may also indicate which communications they would like to receive in the "My Options" settings section of their account. 

If any changes occur to this policy in regard to personally-identifiable information usage, OpenAir will alert all users prior to any action via email. 

This policy was last updated July 10, 2001 (minor stylistic changes only to December 11, 2000 version).
