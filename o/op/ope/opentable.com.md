# Online Reservations Privacy Policy - OpenTable

**OpenTable Privacy Policy (Effective January 25, 2006):**

****OpenTable is committed to safeguarding your privacy and upholding the highest levels of information security.   To that end, the company adheres to the strictest consumer privacy guidelines and uses state-of-the-art security technology to protect any information you provide to and through OpenTable's web site, [www.opentable.com](https://web.archive.org/) ("OpenTable.com"). 

  **Information you will be asked to provide when using OpenTable.com:**

There are two ways you can make restaurant reservations online using OpenTable.com. 

As an **Unregistered User** , you will be asked to provide a name and a telephone number in order to complete the reservation, as you usually would by making a reservation over the phone.  In addition, you will be asked to provide an email address to which OpenTable will send to your attention automated service messages pertaining to your reservation. OpenTable will use this email address for no other purpose unless you have consented to receive marketing material from OpenTable and/or restaurants (which are part of the OpenTable Network), in which case OpenTable will collect data on the category and location at which you have made reservations in order to send you marketing communications which match your preferences. Unregistered Users cannot earn OpenTable Dining Rewards points or save their dining preferences for future visits. 

If you choose to register with OpenTable (become a **Registered User** ) to take advantage of OpenTable's Dining Rewards program and other benefits, you will be asked to provide a name, a telephone number, an email address, a password of your choice and your primary dining city.  You may select not to receive emails from OpenTable (and/or from restaurants which are part of the OpenTable Network), other than automated service messages pertaining to your reservation. Where you have consented to receive marketing material from OpenTable and/or restaurants at which you made a reservation, OpenTable will collect data on the category and location at which you have made reservations in order to send you marketing communications which match your preferences. This can be accomplished via OpenTable’s email opt-out function.  You may also unsubscribe from the OpenTable email list at any time by sending an email to [unsubscribe@insider.opentable.com](mailto:unsubscribe@insider.opentable.com "mailto:unsubscribe@insider.opentable.com") and from a restaurant’s email list by contacting them directly.

You may be invited via email to provide feedback on your dining experience by completing a web-based Diner Feedback Form (“Feedback Form”). Diner feedback may be used to enhance the information on the OpenTable.com website and/or to let restaurants know how they are doing. Any feedback you provide will be summarized with that of other diners. Your feedback will not be publicized in a way that is attributable to you by name, email address, or other identifiable form. You may select not to receive future feedback invitation emails by following the “unsubscribe” instructions at the bottom of the Feedback Form.

For select restaurants and/or holidays, a valid credit card number may be required to secure a reservation using OpenTable.com. In that case, OpenTable works with VeriSign® to verify the credit card.  OpenTable then passes the credit card information through to the restaurant at which the reservation is being made, just as it would be with a phone reservation.  OpenTable does not record or store the credit card information. 

OpenTable may offer OpenTable dining gift certificates for sale on its site.  A credit card number may be required for these purchases.  All such credit card transactions are processed through a fully-encrypted e-commerce site that is protected by VeriSign®.  The credit card number is passed directly to the merchant bank for processing, and is not stored by either OpenTable or the e-commerce site. 

All users outside of the United States should understand that all information shared during the registration and reservation processes is sent to and stored on secure servers that are located in the  United States .  The  United States does not have similar data protection laws to most foreign countries.  If OpenTable transfers your information outside of your host country in this way, OpenTable will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. 

**What information is accessible to restaurants:**

When you make a restaurant reservation using OpenTable.com, your name and telephone number are provided to that restaurant, just as they would if you were making a reservation over the phone. Your email address is not provided to that restaurant unless you specifically indicate you are interested in receiving emails from that restaurant. You also have the option of providing special preferences or comments regarding your reservation or providing other comments, which OpenTable will pass to that restaurant. 

OpenTable will only share the information specified above with the restaurant with which you have made reservations using OpenTable.com. Restaurants cannot access (via OpenTable.com) information pertaining to diners or dining history from other non-affiliated restaurants.  However, all users must understand that any information shared with a restaurant during the reservation process may be used by that restaurant for legally acceptable purposes.  For example, it is conceivable that a restaurant with which you choose to share information may share that information with other restaurants under the same ownership or corporate group.

Restaurants may receive summary reports of collective feedback from recent diners.  Any ratings you choose to provide based on your dining experience will be aggregated with those of other diners so that they are not identifiable to you.  If you provide comments about the restaurant, these may be shared with that restaurant but anonymously. 

Registered OpenTable users may automatically receive “VIP” status if they make and honor twelve or more reservations made through OpenTable.com during the current or previous calendar year.  OpenTable VIP users are identified as “VIPs” to restaurants with which they make reservations using OpenTable so that restaurants may reward these frequent diners with special services if they so choose. Restaurants cannot access the dining histories of OpenTable VIP users other than diners’ histories in their specific restaurant or restaurant group. 

Registered OpenTable users may also make reservations via OpenTable’s “Bonus Point Reservations” promotion.  By reserving in select hours during the promotion, a particular restaurant may view the reservation within their system as one originating from the promotion.  Again these restaurants cannot access the aggregate dining histories of promotion users other than the diner’s histories in their specific restaurant or restaurant group. 

**Viewing your profile and changing your personal information:**

Once a Registered User logs in to OpenTable.com, that user can view the personal information stored by OpenTable by clicking on the "Your Profile" link at the top of the page.In addition to being able to view your recent OpenTable reservation history, every user is also able to view and change the following personal information: name, email address, password, phone number, primary dining city, birthday (if it has been provided by the user), address (if it has been provided by the user), special requests that should be forwarded to restaurants when making reservations (if they have been provided by the user), and whether that user would like to receive email from OpenTable. The user at anytime may request all personal information returned to the user, which may be accomplished by contacting OpenTable. 

If you have questions regarding how to access and change your personal information, please contact customer support at 1-800-OPENTABLE. 

**How OpenTable uses your personal information:**

OpenTable will **never** sell, rent, loan or otherwise distribute any of your personal information (including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number or any other identifiable information about you) to any third party without your expressed written consent, although OpenTable will pass certain information on to the restaurants at which you make reservations, only as described above. 

OpenTable does use aggregated data (based partly on IP addresses of web site visitors) collected through its web site to analyze usability, performance and trends.  While this data, in its aggregated form only, may be shared with third parties with whom OpenTable works to analyze it, the data will only be shared under the strictest terms of confidentiality and will never contain any personally identifiable information pertaining to any user of OpenTable.com. 

Specifically, through an association with a company named WebSideStory, Inc., OpenTable may use web beacons (described in more detail below) and the HBX Analytics auditing software to track page views and entry and exit points to and from OpenTable.com. Again, the data collected will only be used in an aggregated form and will not contain any personally identifiable information, and only OpenTable and WebSideStory will have access to this aggregated data. WebSideStory is legally bound to OpenTable under strict confidentiality provisions and will never share any of this data with any third party. To learn more about WebSideStory and the HBX Analytics software, please visit: [http://www.websidestory.com/.](http://www.websidestory.com/)

In addition, through an association with a company named DoubleClick, Inc., OpenTable uses web beacons and cookies (described in more detail below) to monitor behavior with respect to email sent by OpenTable to Registered Users who opt to receive email from OpenTable.  Again, the data collected will only be used in an aggregated form, and only OpenTable and DoubleClick will have access to this data. DoubleClick is legally bound to OpenTable under strict confidentiality provisions and will never share any of this data with any third party. To learn more about DoubleClick, please visit: <http://www.doubleclick.com/us/>. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this privacy policy, every user should understand that OpenTable may be required by law to disclose user and personal information in response to inquiries by formal law enforcement. 

**How restaurants may use your personal information:**

OpenTable restaurants want to provide you with the best possible service, so that you will visit them again.  To ensure your experience at every OpenTable restaurant meets with your expectations, OpenTable specifically provides information to each of its new restaurant partners detailing privacy laws and the recommended use of personal customer data.  For instance, all OpenTable restaurants are advised not to send email to any user unless that user affirmatively chooses to receive such email. 

As already stated above, each user of OpenTable.com should be aware that any restaurant at which a user makes a reservation may use the data provided by that user for legally acceptable purposes.  In addition, when you are dining at an OpenTable restaurant, the restaurant may use its OpenTable computer reservation system to take note of special requests that you make during your meal, as well as allergies, special events, a signature cocktail, etc. If a restaurant chooses to note your preferences, that information must be typed into its system manually, in the same way a restaurant might write a note on an index card.  This data belongs to the restaurant, since it is a product of that restaurant's relationship with you.  OpenTable does not access or use this information and will never share it with any other OpenTable restaurant or third party.  OpenTable does create back-up copies of all information stored on the OpenTable computer reservation system for that restaurant, to assist in the restoration process in the event of data loss. 

The restaurants within OpenTable’s network are separate businesses from OpenTable and while we encourage them to comply with data protection requirements, OpenTable will not be responsible if these restaurants fail to comply in respect of your information.   The restaurants under their own will may sell or assign all customer information to a separate entity. Any complaints or inquiries about use of your information by or marketing materials from any of these restaurants should be addressed to the restaurant in question.

Restaurants within the OpenTable network may also have their own adjoining website.  OpenTable is not responsible for how these restaurants may collect your personal information through their website.  Please contact the appropriate restaurant regarding their website’s privacy policy (if applicable) and how they would access your personal information. 

**How OpenTable protects your registration information:**

OpenTable uses a state-of-the-art multi-layer encryption algorithm, which ensures that all of your user information is completely secure.  In addition, OpenTable stores all your personal information on a secure server.  OpenTable employs staff that regularly maintains the security of all personal information stored, and will continually monitor and implement changes and improvements that become available in the electronic data security industry. 

**Cookies, web beacons and logging:**

Log-in areas on OpenTable.com require that your browser accept cookies.  A cookie is a small amount of information that is sent to your browser from a web server, and stored on your computer's hard drive.  OpenTable use cookies to remind us of who you are and to verify that you're properly signed in. We may also use cookies from time to time to measure your response to new aspects of our site and/or email in an effort to continually improve our site's usability and our customer service.

Please be aware that a cookie cannot spread computer viruses, retrieve any other data from your hard drive, or capture your email address.

You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual will thoroughly explain this process), but certain OpenTable services and parts of the website may not work correctly or will not work at all if your browser is set to not accept cookies. 

  
Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. OpenTable uses web beacons in the following ways:

OpenTable's practice is to include web beacons in banner advertisements and HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that OpenTable itself sends in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon.

OpenTable includes a web beacon on its post-registration "thank you" page in order to identify the number and source of visitors who register on the web site. 

**Changes to OpenTable's privacy policy:**

Any changes to OpenTable's privacy policy will always be posted to this section of the web site, along with the effective date of the new policy.  All users should check this privacy policy page periodically to stay abreast of any such changes.  OpenTable will **never** make changes to its privacy policy that violate any applicable privacy laws or commercial privacy standards. 

**Contacting OpenTable:**

If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback about OpenTable’s privacy policy, please contact OpenTable via email at [info@opentable.com](mailto:info@opentable.com), via facsimile at 415-267-0938, by telephone at 1-800-OPENTABLE.  You may also write directly to OpenTable, Attn: Legal Department 799 Market Street 4th Floor San Francisco, CA 94103.
