       the information that you submit on our Site with information about you that

     • What Information do you collect on the Web Site and how is it Used?
       We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") from visitors
       to this Web Site. The Non-PII may include, without limitation, information
       such as a Web user's IP address, Web pages viewed by a Web user, date
       and time, domain type and the Web user's computer's operating system
       (e.g., Windows XP). We use this information for internal system
       administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to
       administer the Web Site. Such information may also be used to gather
       demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service
       Provider from visitors to this Web Site. We automatically receive and
       store certain other types of information whenever you interact with us. For
       example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, where
       you travel within the Site, and the page to which you link from the Site.
       This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers
       use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many
       customers as possible.

       browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you
       and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However,

       certain areas or features of the Web Site. The cookies from our Site do not
       collect personal information, however, we may combine information
       collected through certain cookies we issue on our Site with other personal

       Web Site. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although
       it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or
       other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the
       Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a
       Web page or message.

       is not responsible for the information practices of these sites. This Privacy
       Policy does not address the information practices of those other Web sites.

       Information we have on file in your user account (if any). We will respond

       you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to
       respond to your request.
