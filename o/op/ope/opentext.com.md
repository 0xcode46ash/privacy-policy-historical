##    
Privacy and Security

Open Text is committed to protecting your personal information. This statement explains our practices for this Web site. 

##    
Privacy

### What Personal Information We Gather

We gather personal information that we need to know when you ask us to do something for you. For example, if you ask us to send you NewsLink, our monthly newsletter, we need to know and store your e-mail address. We will always ask for your permission and tell you how we're going to use your personal information first. You can always choose not to provide it. 

### How We Use It

We only use the personal information we gather for the purposes to which you have agreed, for example, to send you a newsletter. We do not collect personal information about any of our site's visitors unless the visitor authorizes us to do so. 

### Who Has Access to It

Only people who need to access your personal information can access it; for example, the people who send a newsletter need to know your e-mail address. 

### How We Share It

We do not sell or provide your personal information to any third parties. 

We might share your personal information for the following reasons: 

  * We have your consent.
  * We are required to share customer information by law, to protect the interests of the company or in the discharge of public duty.
  * We need to share your personal information with a business partner in order to provide a service you have requested. Our business partner's use of your information is restricted to the delivery of the service you have requested.



### How You Change or Remove It

You have access to your personal information that we retain. We try to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. If you'd like to change, correct or remove your personal information, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about_us/contact_info.html). 

##    
Security

We use current security measures to safeguard your personal information. 

  * All the personal information you provide us is stored in a secure computing environment protected by secure firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.
  * We control access so that only people who need to access the information can access the information. Everyone at Open Text is required to adhere to a security agreement.
  * To use the Knowledge Center, you must use a confidential Open Text userid and password unique to each person.
  * When you use secure areas of the site, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol with 128-bit encryption. In other words, all the information sent between your computer and our secure computer environment is encrypted or scrambled to that no one can read it in transit. You can read it and we can read itâ€”no one else. There are two cues to show you that you are using a secure area. First, the Web site address (or URL) will appear as https:// (instead of just http://); the "s" is for "secure." Second, a lock or key indicator appears in the status bar of your Web browser.
  * Secure areas of the site also have a time-out feature. If you leave your secure session inactive for some time, the session times-out to prevent unauthorized access.



### Credit Cards

We do accept credit card payments for registrations. If someone uses your credit card to make an unauthorized purchase, check with the institution that issued your card to find out what the exact liability is. 

### E-mail

If you send us an e-mail, we may save it if we think we'll need it to communicate back with you. We never sell or share e-mail addresses. 

Remember, e-mail is not a secure way to send personal information because e-mail is not encrypted. Please don't send any personal information to us over e-mail; use our secure forms or please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about_us/contact_info.html).

### Java and Javascript
