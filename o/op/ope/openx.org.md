# Privacy Policy | OpenX

##  OpenX Privacy Overview

OpenX takes your privacy seriously. And, in fact, privacy is a key component of our core principles of openness, transparency and freedom, all part of our open source heritage. The following privacy policies explain how we use the information we collect as you use our website, products, and services. In addition, we explain your choices for managing your information preferences.

It is important to remember that all publishers and other suppliers of inventory (whether using an OpenX service or other companies’ advertising services) should take into account that third parties such as advertisers may gather non-personally identifiable information about the users of your websites through cookies and other technologies that send such data directly to those third parties. OpenX does not control any third party's use of such data. If you place inventory on or through any OpenX service, your privacy policy should be consistent with and appropriately disclose this to your users.
