# Privacy Legal | open Democracy News Analysis

openDemocracy respects your right to privacy. Any personal information you provide to openDemocracy on this website will be known only to two parties: you and openDemocracy, unless we state otherwise at the time the information is collected or in this privacy policy. 

Please note that all our online transactions are processed by WorldPay, and you should refer to their [privacy policy](https://support.worldpay.com/shopper/) for more details. 

The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our website and its features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide. 

This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. In addition, you will always have the option to edit the information provided to us or to have your personal information removed from our records. 

**Traffic data**

When you visit openDemocracy, our systems collect basic information about your computer, including: IP address (your computer's unique signature), operating system (e.g. Windows XP), browser software (e.g. Internet Explorer), Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL). We also collect information about the pages you view on the site. This information reflects our readership as a whole and is used to help us better understand and serve the openDemocracy community. 

**Use of cookies**

Like most other sites, openDemocracy uses cookies - small files placed on your computer - to track which pages you visit, for how long, and what openDemocracy services you use. Cookies also let us recognise you whenever you return. 

Cookies make it possible for us to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you visit the site, and makes it more convenient for you as you don't need to enter your email address and password each time you enter. 

Occasionally, we may also use cookies to track registered or unregistered users on the site - for instance, we might use cookies so that you don't see a particular advert more than once. This information will never be shared with a third party, and is only used to make our systems more efficient and improve the service we offer you. 

We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. 

Session Cookies are temporary and only remain in your browser's cookie folder until you leave the site. No personal or identifying information is held in these cookies. As soon as you leave our sites or close your browser, they are automatically deleted from your computer. 

Persistent Cookies stay in your browser's cookie folder for a longer period, though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie. This cookie uniquely identifies you, so you can access member services without logging in to the site each time. Clicking logout clears ALL cookies. 

If you are concerned about cookies we recommend the Interactive Advertising Bureau's website [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/), which explains their use and the privacy implications. 

**Email newsletter**

After registering online, users will receive free weekly email newsletters and other occasional announcements from openDemocracy. In order to distribute our email, we collect members' email addresses. We do not share, sell or trade addresses with any other companies or partners. Users can unsubscribe from email newsletters at any time, but we may retain your email address in our records unless you ask us directly to delete it: this allows us to ensure that we do not send you emails in future. 

**Unsubscribe, data removal and data modification policies**

openDemocracy allows users to opt-out of receiving communications from us and to modify information we hold on our system any time. Sign in to the website and visit the [My Account](https://web.archive.org/accounts/my_accounts.jsp) page to edit your details or unsubscribe from the email yourself, or send an email to [theo.edwards@opendemocracy.net](mailto:theo.edwards@opendemocracy.net) with instructions. 

**Send this article to a friend (or foe!)**

openDemocracy offers an email-a-friend feature, which allows users to inform others about articles or discussion forums they may be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for the name and email address of both the sender and recipient. We do not store or save this information and you (or your friend) will not receive any communication from openDemocracy as a result of having used this feature. 

**Discussion forums**

openDemocracy's discussion forums are freely available to all registered users. Please remember: any information you disclose in these areas becomes publicly available automatically. You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in a discussion forum post. Other members will not be able to see your email address unless you want them to. openDemocracy cannot be held responsible for any personal information you diverge in the forums.

**Surveys**

From time to time openDemocracy will conduct voluntary surveys of site visitors to obtain aggregate demographic information. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals. 

**Links to other sites**

openDemocracy contains many links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

**Other disclosure of personal information**

openDemocracy will not use or disclose your personal information without your consent, except (i) as described in this privacy policy or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority or (iii) to operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users. This policy does not protect information you post to any discussion forum or other public forum within our website.
