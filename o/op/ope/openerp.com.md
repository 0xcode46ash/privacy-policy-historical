# Odoo Privacy Policy

### How we protect your privacy on Odoo.com and when you use our services

Odoo SA and its affiliates offer many services to help you run your business, including a platform to host your own Odoo database. As part of running those services we collect data about you and your business. This data is not only essential to run our services, but also critical for the safety of our services and all our users.   
This policy explains what information is collected, why it is collected, and how we use it. 

## Information we collect

Most of the personal data we collect is directly provided by our users when they register and use our services. Other data is collected by recording interactions with our services. 

  


**Account & Contact Data:  ** When you register on our website to use or download one of our products, or to subscribe to one of our services (Odoo Online, Free Trial, Odoo Apps, Odoo.sh, etc.), or fill in one of our contact forms, you voluntarily give us certain information. This typically includes your _name, company name, email address,_ and sometimes your _phone number, postal address_ (when an invoice or delivery is required), _business sector_ and _interest in Odoo_ , as well as a _personal password_.   
We 

_never record or store credit card information from our customers_

, and always rely on trusted third-party PCI-DSS-compliant payment processors for credit card processing, including for recurring payment processing. 

**Job Application Data:  ** When you apply for a job on our website or via an employment agency, we usually collect your contact information ( _name, email, phone_ ), and any information you choose to share with us, in your _introduction letter_ and _Curriculum Vitae_. If we decide to send you a job proposition, we will also ask you to provide extra personal details, as required to fulfill our legal obligations and personnel management requirements.  
We will **not** ask you to provide information that is not necessary for the recruitment process. In particular, we will **never** collect any information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership or sexual life. 

**Browser Data:** When you visit our website and access our online services, we detect and store your _browser language and geolocation,_ in order to customize your experience according to your country and preferred language. Our servers also passively record a summary of the information sent by your browser, for statistical, security and legal purposes: your _IP address_ , the _time and date of your visit_ , your _browser version and platform,_ and the _web page that referred you_ to our website. 

**Customer Database:** When you subscribe to an Odoo Cloud service and create your own Odoo database (for example by starting a Free Trial), any information or content you submit or upload into your database is your own, and you control it fully.   
Similarly, when you upload an on-premises database to the Odoo Upgrade website, you own the data in it.  
This data will often include personal information, for example: _your list of employees, your contacts and customers, your messages, pictures, videos, etc_. We only ever collect this information 

_on your behalf_

, and **you always retain ownership and full control on this data**. 

**In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data:** When you use Odoo on the Odoo Cloud or on your own self-hosted deployments, some optional "In-App Purchase" services may be active by default. This typically includes auto-completion features to help you quickly input client and supplier info, as well as integration with third-party service providers for sending and receiving SMS, paper letters, etc.   
When you use these services, with our without payment, some necessary transaction data is transmitted to Odoo Cloud services and have to be communicated to third-party services for the purpose of executing the service. You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the [IAP Privacy Policy __](https://iap.odoo.com/privacy)page.  
__The IAP services are always **optional** , even when enabled by default, and the IAP Privacy Policy also explains how you can opt-out of those services. 

## How we use this information

**Account & Contact Data:** We use your contact information in order to provide our services, to answer your requests, and for billing and account management reasons. We may also use this information for marketing and communication purposes (our marketing messages always come with a way for you to opt-out at any time). We also use this data in aggregated/anonymised form in order to analyze service trends.   
If you have registered to participate in an event published on our website, we may transfer your _name, email address, phone number_ and _company name_ to our local organizer and to the sponsors of the event, for both direct marketing purposes and in order to facilitate the preparations and booking for the event.   
If you have expressed interest in using Odoo or otherwise asked to be contacted by an Odoo service provider, we may also transfer your _name, email address, phone number_ and _company name_ to one of our official [Partners](https://www.odoo.com/partners) in your country or region, for the purpose of contacting you to offer their local assistance and services. 

**Job Application Data:  ** We will only process this information for our recruitment process, in order to evaluate and follow-up with your application, and in the course of preparing your contract, if we decide to send you a job proposition. You may contact us at any time to request the deletion of your information. 

**Browser Data:** This automatically recorded data is anonymously analyzed in order to maintain and improve our services. We will only correlate this data with your personal data when required by law or for security purposes, if you have violated our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.odoo.com/page/odoo-online-acceptable-use-policy). 

**Customer Database:** We only collect and process this data on your behalf, in order to perform the services you have subscribed to, and based on the instructions you explicitly gave when you registered or configured your service and your Odoo database.   
Our Helpdesk staff and engineers may access this information in a limited and reasonable manner in order to solve any issue with our services, or at your explicit request for support reasons, or as required by law, or to ensure the security of our services in case of violation of our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/es_ES/page/odoo-online-acceptable-use-policy), in order to keep our services secure. 

**In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data:** You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the [IAP Privacy Policy __](https://iap.odoo.com/privacy)page.

## Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Information

**Account & Contact Data:** You have the right to access and update personal data you have previously provided to us. You can do so at any time by connecting to your personal account on Odoo.com. If you wish to permanently delete your account or personal information for a legitimate purpose, please contact our [Helpdesk](https://web.archive.org/es_ES/help) to request so. We will take all reasonable steps to permanently delete your personal information, except when we are required to keep it for legal reasons (typically, for administration, billing and tax reporting reasons). 

**Job Application Data:  ** You may contact us at any time to request access, updates or deletion of your application information. The easiest way to do it is to reply to the last message you exchanged with our Human Resource personnel. 

**Customer Database:** You can manage any data collected in your databases hosted on Odoo.com at any time, using your administration credentials, including modifying or deleting any personal data stored therein.   
At any time you can export a complete backup of your database via our control panel, in order to transfer it, or to manage your own backups/archive. You are responsible for processing this data in compliance with all privacy regulations.   
You may also request the deletion of your entire database via your control panel, at any time.   
When you use the Odoo Database Upgrade service, your data is automatically deleted after your upgrade was successfully completed, and may also be deleted upon request from you. 

**In-App Purchase (IAP) Transaction Data:** You can find the detailed privacy policy for each service on the [IAP Privacy Policy __](https://iap.odoo.com/privacy)page.

__**Safety Retention Period:** we retain a copy of your data in our backups for safety reasons, even after they are destroyed from our live systems. See Data Retention for more details. 

## Security

We realize how important and sensitive your personal data is, and we take a great number of measures to ensure that this information is securely processed, stored and preserved from data loss and unauthorized access. Our technical, administrative and organizational security measures are described in details in our [Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/es_ES/security). 

## Third Party Service Providers

In order to support our operations we rely on several Service Providers. They help us with various services such as payment processing, web audience analysis, cloud hosting, marketing and communication, etc. 

Whenever we share data with these Service Providers, we make sure that they use it in compliance with Data Protection legislation, and that the processing they carry out for us is limited to our specific purpose and covered by a specific data processing contract.

For databases hosted on the Odoo Cloud, if you cancel the service your database is kept deactivated for 3 weeks (the grace period during which you can change your mind), and then destroyed. For databases uploaded to the Odoo Database Upgrade website, your database is kept for up to 4 months after the last successful upgrade, and may be deleted earlier upon request.

As a result, after we delete any of your personal information (Account & Contact Data) from our database upon request from you, or after you delete any personal information from your database (Customer Database), or if you delete your entire database, it is not immediately deleted from our backup systems, which are secured and inalterable. The personal data could remain stored for up to 12 months in those backups, until they are automatically destroyed.   
We commit not to use those backup copies of your deleted data for any purpose except for maintaining the integrity of our backups, unless you or the law require us to do so. 

## Transfer of Data
