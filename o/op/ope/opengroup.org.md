# Privacy | The Open Group

## Privacy Statement

At The Open Group, we know how important personal privacy is to you. Because of our interest in protecting your privacy, we have adopted the following privacy principles:

### Your Expectation of Privacy 

We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and company affairs. We understand the need to safeguard your sensitive information that you have entrusted to us. We maintain standards and procedures designed to prevent misuse of this information.

### Collection, Retention, and Use of Information about You 

We collect, retain, and use information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business, communicate with you or provide products, services, and other information to you. We collect and retain information about you only for specific business purposes – and we will tell you why we are collecting and retaining it upon request. We use that information to protect and administer your records, to comply with certain laws and regulations; to help us design or improve our products and services; so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.

### How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

  We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

  Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

  You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

### Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

### Controlling your personal information

You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:

  * whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes
  * if you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/content/questions-or-comments-our-legal-department).



We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.

### Maintenance of Accurate Information

We have procedures to help assure that your information is accurate, current, and complete in accordance with commercial standards. We also have procedures to respond to your requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. While some of these procedures are required by law, we have implemented additional procedures to maintain accurate, current, and complete information, including processes to update information and remove old information.

### **Limiting Employee Access to Information**

We have procedures that limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those employees with a business reason to know such information about you. We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality privacy through standard operating procedures, and our policies on ethics.  
 

## Security Procedures to Protect Information

We maintain security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. We update and test our technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to ensure the integrity of our information.

### Disclosing Information Outside The Open Group 

We will not sell, distribute, lease nor reveal specific information about your company or personally identifiable data to parties outside our business associates unless it is lawfully permitted or required or we have your permission to do so.  We do not provide account or personal information outside The Open Group and its associates for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct mail marketing of any products or services.

### Maintaining Your Privacy in Business Relationships 

Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a party outside our company, such as to a vendor or service company that we use to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about you and your company with us and must abide by applicable.

### Our Privacy Commitment to You 

We want you to understand our commitment to personal privacy and our use of information. These materials will answer most of the important questions that you may have about how we gather, protect, and use information.
