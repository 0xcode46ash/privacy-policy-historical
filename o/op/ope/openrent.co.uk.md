# Privacy Policy - OpenRent

We respect our users' right to privacy and are fully compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998. As part of this commitment we are a registered data controller with the [ICO](http://www.ico.gov.uk/); our registration number is **Z3143615**. 

Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use and protect any Personal Data you provide to us while using OpenRent and what your rights are in relation to that information. 

Please note that details held by us about a property do not comprise Personal Data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 and as such we may use any listings you create to promote your property and/or our site. 

Details 

  * We will never give away or sell personal information given to us by users of the OpenRent site to third parties. 
  * We may use the information you have supplied to us (email and phone number) to send you tenant enquiries for any property you have advertised with us. When you advertise a property, you may specify the contact details (name, phone number, email address) you wish to use for this purpose. Unless you specifically give permission your email and phone number will not be available to the general public or registered users of the site, although you may receive direct tenant enquiries via a masked phone number or email address. 
  * When you register with us and are signed in, we automatically pre-populate your saved details on contact forms. If you save properties you are interested in or use any of our sharing features, we can identify which properties you have saved and shared. We may anonymously aggregate these details to indicate how many users have saved or shared a particular property, but we will not make available to third parties any personal data relating to which users have saved or shared which properties. 
  * We may use the information you have supplied to us to contact you regarding services and special offers available to you. If you do not wish to receive such information, you may unsubscribe at any time. 
  * Cookies are used to remember your information when you are logged in to your account, making login and form completion more convenient. By using our site, you give us permission to set these cookies. You can set your browser not to accept cookies; doing this will not stop you browsing properties and viewing content on our site, but may negatively impact your browsing experience 
  * Visits to OpenRent are tracked by Google Analytics. This does not include any personally identifying information and does not allow OpenRent to track individual users. The information captured by Google is covered by their own privacy policy which can be viewed [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).
