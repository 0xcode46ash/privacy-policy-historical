These include to (i) investigate potential breaches of your agreements with Red Hat or to establish Red Hat’s legal rights or defend against legal claims, (ii) to detect, prevent or address fraud, technology or security issues, (iii) to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Red Hat, its users or the public or (iv) as required by law or regulation (such as responding to a subpoena, warrant, audit or agency action, and as described in the Red Hat Policy and your agreements with Red Hat).

Red Hat or other third parties may make software and/or services available to you in connection with your use of the OpenShift Online platform.
