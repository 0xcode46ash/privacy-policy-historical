At Opodo, we understand and respect the importance of your privacy. In this privacy policy section, we explain how we collect data about you and your use of this website, how we use that data, who that data may be sent to, and how you can amend data you have submitted.

**How do we collect data about you and your use of the website?**

We ask you for personal information in a variety of circumstances: 

\- when you make a reservation or purchase something from our website or through our customer service team - by email, letter, fax, or on the phone

\- when you register with us, subscribe to our newsletter, enter competitions or register for promotions

\- when you take part in surveys or provide us with feedback 

To make Opodo work even better for you, we also use 'cookies' to collect information about your use of the website. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to temporarily store information within your browser, which in turn allows us to recognise the computer used to access Opodo. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but you can delete existing cookies from your browser. You can also edit your browser options to choose not to receive cookies in future.

To establish how customers reach our site, we employ a third party to collect information through cookies. No personal information (i.e that can identify you) is collected during this process.

**How do we use your data?**

We use your data for the following principal purposes:

\- to provide you with the highest possible level of service and to help you to get the best out of our website

\- to fulfil the bookings and purchases you have made through our website, and any other requests we receive from you

\- to provide you with a personal experience and to ensure that you do not miss any offers or information which are likely to interest you

\- for other administrative purposes and for internal analysis

\- when you contact us by email, we will use the information you give us to provide the service you require (such as when you request a special meal) 

The data you give us will also allow us to send you details of special offers and promotions, update information about Opodo and our partners, and other related information (as part of our newsletter or otherwise)

**Who may your data be disclosed to?**

We disclose your data to our partners who will only use your data for the purposes of fulfilling your booking requests.

We will not disclose your data to any other third parties except where it is necessary for the purposes of fulfilling any bookings, purchases or requests that you make on the website, and through our customer service team or as otherwise described in this policy. We may be required to disclose your information if required by any applicable law or regulation. We may also disclose your data to third parties and professional advisers acting on our behalf and who are obliged to keep that data confidential.

All airlines are now obliged by law to disclose the flight and reservation data of all passengers flying through UK, Australian or United States airspace to the relevant government agency prior to arrival. Data is only used for security purposes.

**Transfer of information**

For any of the purposes set out above, we may transfer your data internationally including to countries outside Europe. Each country may offer different levels of protection, some of which may not be as high as the United Kingdom.

  
**How can you amend your personal data?**

We have done our best to make it easy for you to amend or delete the personal data you have submitted. When you sign in you will see a link called 'Profile' that allows you to edit or delete your details. If you require any other information about the data we hold about you please email us: **enquiries@opodo.com**

**Traveller Profiles**

Opodo collects personal information about travellers when a booking is made. Opodo also has a facility whereby traveller profiles (both for yourself and others) are stored to save you typing these details each time you make a booking. This information includes traveller name, date of birth, contact details, meal preferences, credit card and invoicing information, frequent flyer programmes and travel preferences. This information is only used to fulfil booking and other requests and for administrative purposes and internal analyses. 

As traveller profile information may relate to persons other than yourself, you should ensure that any information you provide, which relates to others, is provided with those persons' consent to its use in accordance with this privacy policy. 

**Opt out**

Unfortunately, due to recent technical problems, the normal 'unsubscribe' link on our newsletters is not functioning. This problem will rectified shortly. In the meantime, you can unsubscribe using the email address **unsubscribe@opodo.com** **** also shown at the bottom of any new Opodo newsletter sent after the 30th November 2005.

For fare alert emails, please continue to use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your alerts.
