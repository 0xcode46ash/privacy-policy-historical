**__Privacy Policy.__**

**_Privacy Policy and Public Information Notice._** Several laws, including the Federal Driver Privacy Protect Act (DPPA), the Ohio DPPA (R.C. 4501.27), the Ohio Public Records Act (R.C. 149.43), and other statutes, rules, and regulations cover your registration information. 

**These public information and privacy rights for Internet information are the same as for all other motor vehicle registration information we receive by mail or in person through deputy registrar agencies.** The laws, rules, and regulations are quite complicated. However, the following is a brief summary of personal privacy rights and public access rights for registration information: 

  1. We do not release your personal information for bulk distribution purposes (surveys, solicitations, "junk mail," etc.) unless you so request. 
  2. We do not release social security numbers, except to other government agencies according to law. 
  3. We do not release resident address information about peace officers except in accordance with law. 
  4. If you have voluntarily given personal information to a legitimate business, we do release confirmation of that information to that legitimate business. 
  5. If you have voluntarily given permission to any person to obtain information from us, we do release that information to that person. 
  6. We do release information to government agencies, for vehicle safety recalls, to courts, for limited research purposes, to insurance companies, to towing companies, to private investigators, to CDL employers, and for other public safety purposes, all in accordance with the restrictions and limitations imposed by law.
