### Acceptance of OPB Website Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this OPB Website Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use the site. OPB reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the OPB website after the posting of any changes to these terms means that you accept those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at [webmaster@opb.org](mailto:webmaster@opb.org).

### Gathering and Use of Personal Information

OPB collects personal information through OPB.org, but only when voluntarily provided by visitors to our website. You may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) registration for contests, sweepstakes, and ticket giveaways, (ii) registration for sites or services that require registration (such as subscribing to email newsletters or commenting on stories or social media networks), (iii) responding to requests for membership information, (iv) making a donation, (v) sending an email to OPB, (vi) submitting a photo or other user- generated content, and (vii) e-commerce transactions. OPB also may ask visitors to provide personal information for other limited uses specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you submit on or through social networking features, as part of story or blog comments, or in response to OPB’s request for user-generated content may become public, including the full name and nickname you provide when registering. When shared through social media, this personal information will be subject to third-party privacy policies (e.g., Facebook).

Except as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by OPB is not provided to outside parties except (i) OPB affiliates (such as NPR, PBS, our program co-producers, and other public broadcasting stations), (ii) certain OPB service providers, and (iii) other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, or otherwise share a story to that friend). In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of -- and only to the extent necessary for -- delivering the requested goods or services to the user, delivering communications from OPB to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, providing services for and on behalf of OPB, or serving other internal OPB purposes.

In certain cases, OPB contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf. Some service providers maintain customer databases with email addresses of website visitors who have provided them to us by registering at our site, signing up for a newsletter or email, emailing us questions about OPB's services, submitting online contributions, or making a purchase. Other service providers maintain personally identifiable information provided in connection with a donation in order to process the donation, or, in the case of information provided in connection with your request for gift planning services, to perform those services. Our service providers have access to your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide certain services on OPB’s behalf. They are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control and only use the information on our or your behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for example sending you a newsletter or supplying you with gift planning information. They are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose. While we strive to work with reputable third- party vendors, we do not have direct control over third parties.

OPB also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of OPB's services, or  
(c) protect the personal safety or property of users of OPB's websites, the public, or OPB and its employees.

If you do not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed purposes, contact [webmaster@opb.org](mailto:webmaster@opb.org). Please recognize that if you select to "opt- out," you may not be eligible for certain activities for which the personally identifiable information is needed.

We may send you email relating to your membership or other online accounts. This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit card processing problems, other transactional emails, and notifications about major changes to our website. If you have registered for online discussions or other services, you may receive email specific to your participation in those activities. You may opt out of such notices at any time by sending an email to [webmaster@opb.org](mailto:webmaster@opb.org).

We offer several email newsletters. If you no longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, you may opt out by following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.

### Gathering and Use of Non-Personal Information

OPB, with the assistance from time to time of its third-party service vendors, uses non-identifying information to analyze use of and better design OPB's website and services. This non-identifying information is shared with third parties as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular audio stream on our website. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.

We also automatically collect, use, and store certain non-personally-identifiable information from those using our website. We and certain third-party vendors (e.g., Google) track how our visitors use the site, identifying the source of visitors to OPB.org and what webpages they visit both on and off of OPB's site. By looking at this traffic, OPB can better understand our community, allowing us to improve our outreach services and provide you with an optimized personal experience.

To provide personalized service and for our convenience, OPB uses cookies and web beacons.

A cookie is a temporary code placed in your computer by our server that facilitates communication and saves you time when you browse our website. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a singlepixel (1x1) or clear gif., which can be used to recognize certain information on your computer, such as cookies or the time and date a page is viewed. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time to customize your web experience or otherwise by tracking your browsing patterns. Neither cookies nor web beacons reveal your name, address, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of our website).

You always have the ability to configure your Web browser to refuse cookies (please consult your browser's user's guide for instructions). In addition, if you wish to opt out of the services provided by web beacons, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

If you subsequently delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again.

### Security

OPB makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on its website are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are encrypted, which is the industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 web sites in more than 50 countries. Any personal information you submit with your donation is encrypted using protocols that meet or exceed current industry standards. These standards are designed to assure the best possible protection against interception and decryption of information sent through our secure connections. Your peace of mind and security is very important to us. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your financial information online, you can make your donation by calling OPB at 1-800-241-8123.

### Kids

OPB does not seek identifying information from children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, you must show permission from one of your parents before sending any information about yourself (such as name, email address, or phone number) via the web. OPB does not knowingly allow anyone under the age of 18 to provide any personally identifying information to OPB.

In the event that someone under the age of 18 does provide information on the OPB website, the child, or his or her parent, may request to see the content or information, and to have the content or information removed from OPB's website. A request can be made by email to [webmaster@opb.org](mailto:webmaster@opb.org). Such email, once verified, will be all that is required for OPB to take action to remove such content from OPB's website. Removal from OPB's website does not guarantee a complete or comprehensive removal of such content from the world wide web. Please contact [webmaster@opb.org](mailto:webmaster@opb.org) if you have further questions.

### Links to Other Websites

OPB's website may contain links to other Internet websites. OPB encourages its partners, contributors, and other third parties to implement policies and practices that respect your privacy. However, OPB is not responsible for other website's privacy practices or content. Occasionally, you may receive cookies from third-party advertisers, partners, and vendors. OPB does not control these cookies.
