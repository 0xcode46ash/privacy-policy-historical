Registration for Participation in Website Activities and Services

 **Use and Collection of Information by Optimum Homes'**

To participate as a member of our Site, or in special events, contests, or sweepstakes, you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, and telephone number, ("personal information") and response to questions about your purchase intent and other related questions.

Non-members may also participate in Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by Cablevision after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password.  Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by Cablevision may require a different registration process.

 **Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers**

Optimum Homes' provides the opportunity to be put in contact with Sellers of certain property and goods.  Companies and individuals other than Cablevision, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries handle these transactions.  We call these partners our "Sellers".  If you request, we will forward your personal contact information to the Seller of your choice so that they may contact you regarding a potential sales transaction.  To facilitate an order or request, we will share your personal information with the Seller.

We request that our Sellers adhere to the provisions in this Privacy Policy and that such Sellers only share visitors' personal information with Cablevision, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order.  We also request that these Sellers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order.  However, you must make yourself aware of a Seller's privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information forwarded to them at your request.

Cablevision, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of Sellers, nor is the Cablevision family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by Sellers.

 **Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices**

This site uses cookies or other tracking devices.  A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive when you visit a site.  The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site.  Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you haven't already provided.  Cookies enable us to track the number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are visiting our website and specific pages, estimate the audience size for sponsors and advertisers and Sellers, and to track user preferences.  You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser.  Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies.  You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site.  However, you may find that some areas on the website will be slower, or may not function at all, and you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled.

 **Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors**

We may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our site.  This advertising company may collect and use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our site and other web sites not owned or operated by Cablevision, and may also combine this information with other data about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  In addition, we may share non-personal web site usage information about visitors to this site with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our site and other sites.  For these purposes, Cablevision and our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear GIFs).  In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer.

Our website may also post banner ads and other forms of advertisements from third parties, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors which are companies that are not owned or operated by Cablevision, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries.  These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors.  Please be advised that when you visit a Seller's or advertiser's website you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator.  Cablevision, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries, will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.

 **Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Other Parties**

We only share or disclose your personal information with companies other than Cablevision when it is required by law, you affirmatively consent, disclosure is necessary to operate the website or our website services, and/or to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property.  We reserve the right to share personal information (such as your name, address and e-mail address) with Cablevision affiliates or other entities for other marketing purposes.  If you do not wish us to share your personal information please contact us at [privacy@optimumhomes.com](mailto:privacy@optimumhomes.com).

When you send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information.  However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons.  Please see our Terms of Service.  We may share your personal information with the Seller(s) of goods and products advertised on this website, our operational providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the website, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors.

We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor.  We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

 **How To Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information**

You will have access to your membership profile collected and maintained by our website.  You may add, change or delete personal information on your profile or registration for other activities by contacting us via e-mail at [support@optimumhomes.com](mailto:support@optimumhomes.com).  Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws.  We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes in your membership information and e-mail address.

 **Our Security Procedures**

We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website.  Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information.  The databases are protected in a secure facility.  If we decide to share visitor information with other members of the Cablevision family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website.

For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful website links provided by other entities and/or persons.  Cablevision does not endorse or recommend, nor is it liable for, the products or services of any websites not owned or operated by Cablevision.  When you visit other websites you will also be subject to the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that website operator.

 **Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy**

We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as Cablevision deems appropriate.  We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy.  We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.

 **Children's Privacy**

We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen.  Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen.  If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, user name and password from our records.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.
