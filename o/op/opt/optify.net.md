# Privacy | Optify

Optify, Inc. is committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy policy describes the measures we take to protect your privacy in connection with your use of [www.optify.net](http://www.optify.net/) (the “Site”).

This Privacy Policy applies to both corporate and individual customers and the individual users of our services. Customers and users are collectively referred to herein as “you.”

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.optify.net&sealid=101)

Optify is certified through the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. In order to obtain certification, Optify disclosed its information privacy practices to TRUSTe for its review to ensure compliance with TRUSTe’s requirements. If you contact us with a privacy-related concern as directed in this Policy and do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or if your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.

#### What Information We Collect

**Registration.** If you choose to register with the Site, we may ask for your name, title, company name, billing address, e-mail address, phone number and other relevant information. When you create an account, we require that you create a user name and password.

**Feedback and Optify Support.** We use a third party service provider to host our feedback and Optify Support pages. You may submit contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address, in connection with feedback, concerns, complaints, questions, or technical support. Such information is used only to respond to those inquiries and is governed by this Privacy Policy.

**IP Address.** An Internet Protocol (”IP”) address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to log your visits and to administer our Site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information.

**Cookies.** A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies supplied by your browser or by third-party add-ins. We use session identification cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. We also use a persistent cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services (including, without limitation to hold your shopping cart information). We do not tie any Personal Information to the cookies that we set on our Site.

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. There are two instances in which we use a permanent cookie. First, when you visit our Site and request documentation or a response from us. Second, when you “Sign Up” or “Sign In” to our service. We send a permanent cookie to your browser when you have filled out the information on the “Sign Up” form or when you “Sign In” to our service.

These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other websites you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies on our Site. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/Pixel Tags).** Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are placed on a user’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on webpages. We may use clear gifs to track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. Our use of clear gifs will not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. Additionally, be aware that advertisers and partners may also use their own clear gifs. We do not control use of these and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**Log data.** We automatically collect typical web server log data (such as IP addresses and the pages you visit) when you use the Site. This information helps us evaluate how our subscribers use the services.

**User Content.** You may elect to contribute content to the Site including forum postings, blog entries, and other content that you own or have the right to display and reproduce. Providing such information is optional. Please note that any personally identifiable information you post these forums, blog entries, or other content to our Site may be viewed by others and used by others to send you unsolicited messages.

**Add New User Feature.** Users designated with “Admin” rights have the ability to use the “Add New User” feature which includes submission of a name, email address and Twitter signature. We collect this information and generate an email invitation to confirm such party’s acceptance of such use, including the forming of a customer relationship, and to create a unique password. Both the Admin and Optify have the ability to track a new user’s login, profile and usage.

**Customer Testimonials.** We post customer testimonials on our Site which may contain personally identifiable information.  We do obtain the customer’s consent via email to include their name prior to posting the testimonial.

#### How We Use Personally Identifiable Information

**Customer Relationship.** We will use your personally identifiable information in the context of your customer relationship with Optify, including setting up your account, the operation of our Site, solving problems associated with our Site and services, improving our Site and services, reporting, and providing you with our newsletters. From time-to-time we notify our customers of new products or services that will better meet their needs, announcements, updates and upgrades. If you would like to opt-out of being notified, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you would like to change your preferences online, please contact us at [customers@optify.net](mailto:customers@optify.net). If you receive a marketing communication from our subsidiaries, business partners or independent resellers, you should opt-out with that entity directly.  Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the security, initial use, expiration, product enhancement or other products or services.

**Targeted Information.** We may associate your personally identifiable information with your viewing history, comments and/or other non-personally identifiable information we collect from you while you are on our Site for our internal purposes. We will not share this information with third parties without your permission, although we may provide data to third parties in an anonymized form that cannot be used to identify you as an individual.

Optify partners with Salesforce.com to organize requests for sales related contacts. If you request more information about our services we send your contact and other information to our account at SalesForce.com. Salesforce.com is an application service provider that many companies use to organize prospects and call-back requests, etc. They are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. Salesforce.com participates in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal program.

**Credentials.** When you first sign up for a service with Optify, we use your registration information to assign credentials to you. These credentials permit you to access the services and use certain administrative features.

**Email.** From time to time, we may send e-mail messages informing you of products and services we believe may be of interest to you. Those marketing e-mails may contain code that enables our database to track the usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine such information to improve your experience with our services and equipment and/or provide customized e-mail communications.

#### How We Share Information

Except as set forth below, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties (aside from entities that perform services for us that are either bound to comply with our Privacy Policy or have privacy policies that protect your information).

We may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety; and/or (4) to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.

We may gather usage data and demographic information from you from time to time. We will not share such information with any person or entity in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless we let you know that at the time of collection, or we have your permission. When we share usage and demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event Optify is acquired, merges with another entity, becomes insolvent, and/or declares bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred or sold to another entity, in accordance with applicable law.
