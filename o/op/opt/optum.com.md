# Privacy

Clickcommerce.com is owned and operated by Click Commerce, Inc. ("Click"). Click collects personal and non-personal information on clickcommerce.com. Click is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. If you have any questions or concerns in connection with Click's information collection practice summarized in this Privacy Statement, please send an email, with the subject heading "Privacy Statement Question," to [click.legal@clickcommerce.com](mailto:click.legal@clickcommerce.com).

To participate in certain activities and to obtain certain services offered on this website, a user is asked to provide varying amounts of personal information. Some information is mandatory while other information is discretionary. Each activity and service requires or requests different types of information in order for users to participate. Activities or services that require provision of personal information generally seek full name, email address, and phone number. We endeavor to limit our requests for personal information to information we believe is minimally necessary to achieve our stated collection purposes.

The following is a list of principal activities and services involving collection of personal information:

  * Alliance Program 
  * Downloading of free software or documents 
  * Viewing of product demonstrations 
  * Participating in web seminars or other events 
  * Career opportunities 
  * Participating in user surveys 
  * Clickconnect.com access 



## How does Click use my information?

Personal information is collected and used primarily for such purposes as processing a user's resume or considering alliance applications. The personal information provided in resumes and alliance applications is used to consider the eligibility of candidates. We may also use a user's email address, phone number or address:

  * in our internal surveys to obtain feedback on our products, our web site, or on other aspects of our business that impact you as a Click customer; 
  * to notify a user of new products or services that we think may be of interest; 
  * to send promotional materials; 
  * to provide a free email newsletter. 



If a user prefers not to receive emails or other forms of communication unrelated to Click orders and requests for services, the user may opt-out from receiving such communication. The opt-out procedure is discussed in detail below. We may also use personal information to contact a user in connection with the user's inappropriate use of our website. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise dispose of the personal information collected on our website to third parties. We may, however, disclose your personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law. We may use non-personal information such as demographic data to analyze and develop our marketing strategy. We use non-personal information to determine how you found out about us, what your interests are regarding our services, and how to further improve our site and our service towards you. We also may share non-personal information with third parties.

## What are Cookies and how does Click use them?

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use "cookie" technology for several purposes. First, we use it to track general information about our users. The information collected through cookies is non-personal information and we use this information for statistical and market research purposes. We also use cookies to establish a link between your computer and clickcommerce.com. This link assures that, when you return to clickcommerce.com, you will be able to log in without the necessity of providing your password. You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

## Does Click's privacy policy apply to linked web sites?

Our Privacy Statement applies solely to information collection practice on clickcommerce.com. This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Click has no control or influence over the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave clickcommerce.com and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

If we later change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email.
