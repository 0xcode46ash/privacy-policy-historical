# Optum Website Privacy Policy - Optum.com

### Introduction

We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important to you.  The purpose of this Website Privacy Policy is to let you know how we handle the information we receive from you through this website. Portions of this website may describe additional privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific Web pages. 

This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this Website Privacy Policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Company” refer to Optum and its current and future affiliate entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group. 

This site is intended for a United States audience.  Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the U.S.

### Cookies and Non-Personal Information

“Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather non-personal information from our website visitors such as which pages are used and how often they are used, and to enable certain features on this website. 

“Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website.  Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.  Your computer may permit you to disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website.
