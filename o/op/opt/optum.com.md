Like most Web site operators, Optum does collect non-personally identifying information that Web browsers and servers typically make available such as: (1) our Web sites may deposit a small file called a “cookie” on a visitor’s computer hard drive to personalize their experience or track aggregate site visitation statistics; and (2) our Web sites may use Web beacons in combination with cookies to help Optum identify and track usage of Optum Web sites in order to gather aggregate data related to the usage and usability of Optum Web sites. Optum will use this “Web analytics” data only as aggregate site visitation statistics or to personalize the end user experience.

Optum’s purpose in collecting Web analytics information is primarily to better understand how Optum visitors use its Web sites and to optimize visitors experience and interaction with our Web sites. Optum will only share this information with its employees, contractors and agents for the purpose of understanding and enhancing Optum Web sites and their user experience. 

Web site visitors may opt-out of the use of the Analytics and customization technology used by Optum.com sites by following this [link](http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0) \- for to the Analytics opt-out page. Note that opting out of that analytics and customization technology may impact site functionality.

Our Web sites may customize the Web site viewing experience and/or capture Web analytics by using either internal analytics software or by sending this information to vendors to help Optum analyze this data. Optum has agreements with its vendors that they will not share or use the information for purposes other than to maintain and enhance the services they provide to Optum.

Optum does not allow its employees, contractors or agents to correlate, link, or attempt to link its Web analytics data to personally identifiable information.

The visitor may disable your “cookie” information by adjusting their browser preferences on your personal computer at any time. 

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. Your IP address may also may be used to help identify visitors and to gather broad demographic information and to respond to legal requests.
