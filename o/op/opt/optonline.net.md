We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website. To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes.

To participate as a member of our general audience website, or in special events, contests, or sweepstakes, or Interactive Areas you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender ("personal information").

Non-members may also participate in any Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by Cablevision after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password. Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by Cablevision may require a different registration process.

We may also survey visitors about various topics, including how we can improve our, website and services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.

We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website.

We may also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card to another person to inform them about Cablevision activities or to send copies of articles or video appearing on the website. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-Cards.

The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you. This website does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information.

This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.

Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.

For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase and/or avail yourself of certain goods, merchandise and services through this website. Companies other than Cablevision, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "operational providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us.

In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in Cablevision's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with Cablevision, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order. However, you must read an operational providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online.
