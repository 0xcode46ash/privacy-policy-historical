The only personal information this Web site obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you to Cablevision or its affiliates.

If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information from our records.

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law. For example, we may collect personal information from a child to provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; to respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; to protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; to protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions against liability or to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
