# Privacy | InvestorPlace

**NEW  PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective as of September 19, 2016**

Available online at <http://investorplace.com/corporate/privacy/>

**_Overview_**

You should read this entire Privacy Policy, but here is a partial list of some of the key topics.  Any capitalized terms have the meanings given to them where defined in the Privacy Policy.

  * We ask you for, and use Tracking Technologies (defined below) to detect, information about you, and third parties may also do so in connection with our Service (defined below). As examples: 
    * Third parties, including advertisers and advertising services providers, may collect information about you.  They may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities.  Their privacy policies, not ours, govern their practices.
    * We do not monitor or take any action with respect to so-called browser do not track signals.
  * We may share your information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, however, we will only do so when you have a choice to opt-in or opt-out from that type of sharing. Opt-outs apply prospectively to our sharing.  To opt-out of marketing from third parties that have previously been provided your personal information, contact them directly.
  * **Your CA Privacy Rights:** California residents have certain rights regarding our sharing of certain personal information with third parties for direct marketing.  See **_Section 4_**  for more information.
  * You consent to our practices detailed in our Privacy Policy. Each time you use the Service, the version of our Privacy Policy then posted will apply to that use, so check for updates each time you access the Service.



Welcome! You have arrived at www.investorpalce.com and/or are otherwise interacting with our Service (defined below), which is owned and operated by InvestorPlace Media, LLC ( **“Company”** **“InvestorPlace”** or **“us”** ).  This Privacy Policy governs your use of any online service that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (each a **“Site”** ) (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions), and also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services that we own and control and make available through a Site and/or that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the **“Service”** ), regardless of how you access or use them, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise, but does not apply to data we receive from third parties, except to the extent we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below), and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may interact with our Service.  Also, it is limited to our practices, and our Service includes access to third party content and services we do not control.  Consult their privacy policies regarding their practices.

To the extent we provide you notice on our Service of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.  **_By using our Service_ , _you agree to our[ _Terms and Conditions_](http://investorplace.com/corporate/terms-conditions/) and consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below._**  Each time you use the Service, the version of our Privacy Policy then posted will apply to that use, subject to **_Section 11_** , so check for updates each time you access the Service.

  1. **Collection of Information**



On the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name,  e-mail address, and mailing address (“ **Personal Information** ”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender, age, marital status, income or investment portfolio size, etc. (“ **Demographic Information** ”).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including at registration and when you subscribe to newsletters and other content.  To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.  In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies ( **“Tracking Technologies”** ) that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“ **Usage Information** ”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or other device (a “ **Device** ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat such combined data as Personal Information, but we do not otherwise treat it (including IP Addresses, Device ID and other unique identifiers) as Personal Information (i.e., we treat it as Non-Personal Information), except to the extent required by applicable law.

We collect no Personal Information about our users that is not supplied voluntarily by you such as through web forms or email. We, however, may at times collect Usage Information automatically from you.  Some of this Usage Information is collected through the use of cookies and other now and hereafter developed Tracking Technologies. Many types of cookies (but not all) may be deactivated by the user at any time through features available on your Internet browser. Transparent gifs or pixels may occasionally be used for the same purpose, but these items gather no Personal Information and have no effect on how you view our Services or how you navigate the Sites.

Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by InvestorPlace and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant information to you.  Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals”.  For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, though they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user.  Further, there is not yet an industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.  Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.  For more information on “do not track” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).  For information on options related to interest-based advertising, see **_Section 7._**

InvestorPlace’s privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to current law or government regulation.

  2. **Use and Sharing of Your Information**

All of our e-letters, alerts and special notices that we send on behalf of our advisors and partners are sent only to those who have specifically agreed to our confirmed opt-in policy.

This ensures our users are properly subscribed with a working address and with the owner’s consent. Unsubscribe instructions are included at the bottom of each promotional email we send.  We typically also provide the opportunity to unsubscribe from newsletters and other content to which you have subscribed.  Some e-letter issues include advertising, typically marked as such.

We may share your email address and other Personal Information, along with Demographic and/or Usage Information, for any reason not prohibited by law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or privacy notices made by InvestorPlace at the time the applicable Personal Information was collected.  For instance, we may provide you opportunities to receive information directly from third parties such as our advertisers and partners.  If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with our partners for their own direct marketing to you, [click here.](http://u.investorplace.com/3p/)

We use it to send you the Special Reports you have requested, newsletters that you have purchased and special offers from InvestorPlace. We may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of our subscribers to companies who offer products, services or information that we believe may be of interest to you.

**(c)        You Submission of Personal Information to Third Parties**

We may provide you with registration and submission tools that allow you to submit Personal Information to a third party directly, such as to request promotional and other information from the third party.  In such case you, not we, are sharing your Personal Information with the third party, you consent to facilitation we may perform do to enable you to do so and you agree to look solely to that third party regarding its receipt and use of your data.

The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party website, platform, tool, application or other service, and accessing or display of third-party content via the Service (“ **Third Party Services** ”).  When you use Third Party Services, you are using their services and not our Service and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such Third Party Services in connection with our Service.

**(d)        Making a Purchase Through an InvestorPlace Website**

When you purchase a newsletter service online from us, we will request certain Personal Information, including your name, postal address, daytime and evening telephone numbers, and credit card number (where applicable) only for the purposes of contacting you about your InvestorPlace family of services. Individuals who do not have a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express credit card are not permitted to make purchases online.

When you purchase a newsletter or other service through InvestorPlace, you will also receive relevant bulletins from your newsletter author, announcements of web content, and information on new services provided by your newsletter author. We may also use your email address to contact you with questions about your subscription or service, or to remind you of your site password, if necessary.

**  (e)      Other Sharing of Your Information**

Your Personal Information is not shared with third parties other than as described above, except as follows:

  * With our vendors that provide services to us;
  * In connection with a merger or acquisition as set forth in Section 6 below; and
  * Where you have otherwise consented.



In addition, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of InvestorPlace or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Privacy Policy, our [**_Terms and Conditions_**](http://investorplace.com/corporate/terms-conditions/), and other applicable agreements and policies); (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations and government requests (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders); (iii) comply with our obligations and commitments to safeguard the privacy and security of your information; or (iv) prevent unauthorized, improper or illegal activities on the Service.  Further, we may disclose information about you as otherwise permitted under our Terms and Conditions or as specifically disclosed when we collect information from you.  Additionally, if you notify us that you believe your rights have been violated in connection with the Service or another user of the Service, we may disclose information about you to the extent necessary to evaluate and respond to your concern.  To the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, we have complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you.

We may share **“Non-Personal Information”** (i.e., information that is not or is modified not to be Personal Information), such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.  For instance, if we de-identify data about you, it is not treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely.  Except where prohibited by applicable law, we may share your IDs with third parties along with data (other than Personal Information) related to you and your activities as non-Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

  3. **How Can You Be Sure That Your  Information is Secure?**



We take the security of your Personal Information quite seriously and we make ongoing efforts to protect it.  However, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secured. Though we take great care to protect your personal information, InvestorPlace cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, including your portfolios on PortfolioGrader.com, and you do so at your own risk. We do not share your credit card number with other parties, other than those involved with the administration of your subscription and related transactions.

If any unauthorized use of your credit card occurs as a result of your credit card purchase from InvestorPlace, simply notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, through no fault of your own, your credit card company finds credit card fraud as a result of your credit card purchase from InvestorPlace but does not waive your entire liability for unauthorized charges, we will reimburse you for the remaining liability, up to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars ($50.00) per card. You can also take steps to secure your Personal Information. When you are finished at InvestorPlace.com, sign off the InvestorPlace site and close your browser window. This helps to ensure that someone else cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a computer that is accessible to others in a public place, such as a library, a school or your office.

  4. **Your California Privacy Rights**



We do not share personal information as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83 collected by us on the Service with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without giving you the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out as more fully described in Section 2 above.  If you are a California resident, you may request information about our compliance with the Shine the Light law by contacting us [InvestorPlace@InvestorPlace.com](mailto:InvestorPlace@InvestorPlace.com) or by sending a letter to 9201 Corporate Boulevard, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20850, Attention: Legal Counsel.  Any such request must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address or mail address.

  5. **How Can You Use the Information  Found at InvestorPlace?**



We grant our users the right to download, store or output materials from our site for their personal use only. Materials may not be reproduced in ANY edited form. Any other reproduction, transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by any means, mechanical or electronic, without the express written permission of InvestorPlace is strictly prohibited. Users wishing to obtain permission to reprint or reproduce any materials appearing on InvestorPlace may contact us at [InvestorPlace@InvestorPlace.com](mailto:InvestorPlace@InvestorPlace.com) or 1-800-219-8592. All contents of InvestorPlace and related sites are copyrighted by InvestorPlace Media, LLC.

  6. **What Happens In the Event of a  Merger or Acquisition?**



InvestorPlace is a dynamic investment advisory service publisher. As our business continues to develop and grow, it is possible that we might sell or buy other publishers, advisory services, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that InvestorPlace Media, LLC, or a substantial part or all of its assets (including InvestorPlace.com) are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.  Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose and transfer your Personal Information and other data (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change; including, in either case, during the course of any related due diligence process.

  7. **What About Advertising?**



InvestorPlace features several services that are co-sponsored by other websites and other third parties. One example of such a feature is the quote service. Additionally, our site contains links to other websites, including those of advertisers. We are not responsible for the claims or representations made by advertisers or sponsors. While these co-sponsored activities, banner ads and links originate on InvestorPlace, we do not operate them. For example, if you click on a link or banner advertisement, that click takes you out of InvestorPlace to either the service or ad provider’s site. These other sites may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies, collect data, or solicit Personal Information from you. Since we do not have control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites, we recommend that you check their privacy policies before giving out any personal information.

In addition, InvestorPlace may engage and work with service providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on our Service and/or on third-party services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” ( **“Interest-based Advertising”** ), which may include sending you an ad on a third party service after you have left our Service (i.e., “retargeting”).  You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs.  Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“ **DAA** ”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices offered through the DAA regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit [**http://www.aboutads.info/choices/**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).  Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see **_http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/_** _._   Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.  Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads ( _e.g._ , from other ad networks).  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access ( _e.g._ , mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  InvestorPlace supports the ad industry’s **_2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising_** **(** ** _http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf_** ** _)_** and expects that ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance. InvestorPlace is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

  8. **Contact Us**



We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We hope this Privacy Policy has explained what we do with the Personal Information that we collect from you, our views and practices regarding Personal Information, and how they affect you as you use our features and services, and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used.

  9. **Changes to the Privacy Policy**



We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of our Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use.  However, we will not use your previously collected Personal Information, to the extent it is not collected under the new Privacy Policy, in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.  To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.
