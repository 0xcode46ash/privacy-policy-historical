This Privacy Policy is applicable to Registered Users and Subscribers of OptionsZone.com.

Your privacy, and the privacy of all OptionsZone.com Registered Users and Subscribers is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy, based on the principles of notice, choice, access and security in the collection and use of all information regarding our members and their activities at InvestorPlace Media LLC Web sites. 

Our data collection and privacy practices are described below. This policy tells you, among other things, what information we may gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it. Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us at service@optionszone.com if you have any questions regarding its contents. 

**What information do we gather?**

OptionsZone.com may obtain three types of information from its Registered Users and Subscribers:  
1\. Registration, subscription, or application data,   
2\. site usage data, and  
3\. voluntary postings. 

**Registration, Subscription, or Application Data.** The only individually identifiable information that OptionsZone.com seeks about you is that which you are asked to provide when you register for our free Virtual Trading Tool. This information includes your name, e-mail address and other voluntary information. 

**Site Usage Data.** We collect non-identifiable information to measure how our Registered Users and Subscribers use the OptionsZone.com Web sites. This information may include statistics about the numbers and timing of unique visits to ChangeWave, repeat visits, and which pages are viewed. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **What do we do with personal information about you?**

Your registration, subscription, and Alliance application data will be closely protected. 

Many of the features on InvestorPlace Media's Web sites are designed to be "personalized" to meet the needs and interests of our Registered Users and Subscribers. To support this personalization, we need to be able to identify your account each time you log in to an InvestorPlace Media Web site. 

We may combine your application data and information about your usage of our Site with those of all or a particular group of our members, to prepare aggregated, non-identifiable profiles of our members and their activities on our Site. For example, we may track the number of our members who view certain pages or use certain features. Such information, and other aggregated information we derive from individual members' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with timely and useful information through our Site. 

With regard to our advertisers, we may provide them with non-identifiable, aggregated information about OptionsZone.com's Web site traffic. This information may also be disclosed in describing our web sites and services to prospective business partners and other third parties. However, this aggregated information about website traffic will not include personally-identifiable information such as registration, subscription, or Alliance application data or individual page-views. 

ChangeWave also reserves the right to disclose information as required by law, or to the extent that we believe in good faith that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or property.

 **Registered Users and Subscribers.** OptionsZone uses registration and subscription information to maintain records about your use of InvestorPlace Media's services, for billing purposes, and for us to occasionally send you information on products and services that OptionsZone or InvestorPlace Media LLC, our parent company, offers. If you do not wish to receive this information you may "opt out" by sending an email stating such to service@optionszone.com.

We may also occasionally provide the names and postal mailing addresses (but not e-mail addresses or telephone numbers) of InvestorPlace Media's Registered Users and Subscribers to third parties who offer products, services, or information which we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to provide this information, you may "opt out" by sending an email stating such to service@optionszone.com.

Registered Users and Subscribers who have not been receiving information from OptionsZone, InvestorPlace Media LLC or third parties but now wish to receive such information may "opt in" by sending an email stating such to service@optionszone.com.

 **How do OptionsZone's service providers use personally identifiable information?**

When a Registered User or Subscriber signs up for their services, we will share names or other contact information necessary for Strategy.com to provide their services. Strategy.com has agreed not to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their services.

 **How does OptionsZone.com use "cookies"?**

Using InvestorPlace Media's Web sites requires that you accept the use of "cookies," which are small files that our Web sites send to your Internet browser for storage on your computer's hard drive. Options Zone uses cookies to facilitate the login process for you across multiple applications on our sites, to measure traffic on our Web sites, and to "personalize" your experience as a Registered User or Subscriber, where applicable. When you register or subscribe, we assign a unique identifier to you, and we place a cookie on your computer which will remind our system of that identifier in other areas of our web sites, or the next time you visit one of InvestorPlace Media's Web sites. This cookie allows you to access all of your personalized areas of our web sites without having to log on multiple times. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site, but you will be limited in some areas of our site. The cookies alone cannot be used to identify you. Instead, your computer is assigned an identifier and that identifier is tracked using the cookie. This identifier is meaningful only within our secure database system and your personalized version of Options Zone. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers), and we have no access to, control over, or responsibility or liability for these cookies. 

We also use cookies to measure activity on our Web sites. Our plans for improvements and updates are based on which areas of our web sites are popular and which are not. Everything we learn from these measurements will be used to enrich your experience on our web sites. Options Zone does not use cookies for promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with third parties.

 **What happens to my information if I am no longer a Registered User or Subscriber?**

 **Former Registered Users and Subscribers.** Registration and subscription information is retained unless you ask us to delete it. You may request that your registration or subscription data be deleted from our system by sending a request to service@optionszone.com. 

**How is your information protected?**

We use industry-standard encryption methods to transmit data and credit card information submitted by Registered Users and Subscribers between your computer and ours across the Internet. We restrict access to any transactional portions of our web sites to computers running web browsers that support the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use this protection technology, registered users and subscribers need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher. These browsers will automatically activate the encryption technology when you log on to one of our web sites. 

Please remember that you play a valuable part in data security as well. Your passwords to access our Web sites, which you select when you register or subscribe should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished using one or more of our web sites, you should log off and exit your browser so that no unauthorized persons can use our web sites under your name and account information.

We encourage you to review these external sites' policies carefully before revealing any sensitive or personal information. 

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
