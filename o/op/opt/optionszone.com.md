## What Happens In the Event of a Merger or Acquisition?

As our business continues to develop and grow, it is possible that we might sell or buy other publishers, advisory services, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that InvestorPlace Media, LLC, or a substantial part or all of its assets (including InvestorPlace.com) are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

## What About Advertising?

InvestorPlace features several services that are co-sponsored by other websites. One example of such a feature is the quote service. Additionally, our site contains links to other web sites, including those of advertisers. We are not responsible for the claims or representations made by advertisers or sponsors. While these co-sponsored activities, banner ads and links originate on InvestorPlace, we do not operate them. For example, if you click on a link or banner advertisement, that click takes you out of InvestorPlace to either the service or ad provider’s site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Since we do not have control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites, we recommend that you check their privacy policies before giving out any personal information. InvestorPlace and InvestorPlace Media, LLC do not own, control, have access to or maintain any information collected by our co-sponsors or advertisers.
