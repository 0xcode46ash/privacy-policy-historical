**Our Commitments to You**

Excite Australia (Excite) wants to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information to provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you tell us. Our goal is to provide you with a robust experience while allowing you to control your privacy and giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. On other occasions when we provide items for purchase online, we may request your credit card number to conclude the transaction or your mailing address to ensure proper delivery. We request this information to provide our strongest value to you - a personalised online experience. Customer's who personalise our service come back more often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make us successful - so we do everything we can to make Excite your service with your name all over it and give you just the content you need.

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

**Anonymous Information** : Refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are "anonymous" to us, much like how your local bus service knows how many people take a given route - but don't necessarily know who those people are. Many of the individuals who access our services use none of the personalisation features which are available to them and are therefore anonymous to us.

**Personally Identifiable Information** : Refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address. With this information, Excite can provide a variety of personalised and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users. Examples would be the "My Excite Start Page," which uses your mailing address to customize TV schedules, weather reports and sports scores. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more valuable to you.

The choice of how much of your personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose to Excite is left completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you register for a personalised service or enter one of our sweepstakes at one of our sites.

**Our Commitments to Your Family**

Like yourself, we at the Excite Network have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Internet sites. That is why we have established the following guidelines for the way we interact with children when they access our services. 

If a customer registers with us and their birth date indicates that they are less than 18 years old, we will:

  1. Never voluntarily share their customer information with any third-party, regardless of their stated preference given at registration

  2. Never list them in any Member Directory in a manner in which their age can be easily identified




In summary, for those who register on our site who are under 18, we'll do everything we can to make sure that their information won't leave our company and someone using our site won't be easily able to look up their age. These protections are a start, but there are some actions that we cannot control and in these areas we need help from the child's parent or guardian as well. For instance, we can't stop a minor from giving their age in our unmoderated online chat sessions - but you can counsel them against taking actions like this. 

**What personally identifiable information of yours is collected?**

So that we can provide personalisation and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name, email address, or to share with us your interests and hobbies. You never have to answer these questions and you can decline this exchange of information on any site at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of such information such as a personalised stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our network.

To enable many of the features available within the Excite, we will assign to your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator™ or Microsoft Internet Explorer™) a unique identification number stored in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact on one of our Internet domains. When you visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers "Hello, I'm browser #782. What do you do just for me?" Only when you agree to provide information to our services directly, such as through registration, will we be able to know anything about you other than the random number that our server computers assign to your browser in the first place.

There is much confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they can do. Cookies are very small text files written by an Internet server to a customer's browser when information is exchanged. Cookies only contain information that the server computer assigned or "knew" in the first place and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them. For instance, Yahoo!™ utilizes cookies but Excite's servers can't read their contents nor can Yahoo!'s servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today and allow server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides personalised content to you without you having to "log in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. As cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information or transmit it to anyone. 

Cookies are implemented as part of the technology implemented by your web browser. For more information about cookies, please visit: <http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/privacy.html>.

**How is the information used?**

Our network has been designed to enable personalised services for those people who choose to use them. Many of those services that are provided for free through the Excite Network are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced services and content is dependent on our ability to provide targeted advertising for our partners and clients. Below is a description of how our visitors and advertisers benefit from our use of subscriber information: 

  1. We provide personalised content in the form of news, horoscopes, advertisements, weather reports, stock portfolios, movies, and television listings to our members.

  2. We monitor the actions of the users of our site to determine what our customers want and do not want. 

  3. We provide advertisements that support our customers' specific requests for information through key-word searches and editorial content. Do a search on "cars," for instance, and you'll usually see a banner advertisement from an automobile company.

  4. We develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use Excite for free - our advertisers - need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. 

  5. It is our policy to never send e-mail messages to members who have asked us not to do so, either at initial registration or later through an unsubscribe process. In every email from any company or Web Site of the Excite, we will remind you of your option to change your preferences regarding receipt of email communications. Additional information is provided in the What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information section below.




**Information Distribution**

If you are providing personally identifiable information within a registration page, it will only be used within the Excite Internet domains unless you choose to allow third party data sharing. Anytime we collect personalised information, we present our members with a series of choices as to how we can use this information. Should you choose to provide your information to third parties, Excite will share aspects of your information with our valued partners. These partners help contribute towards many of the free services available on the Excite Network.

Although unlikely, Excite may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. 

Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above [#personalinfo]). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect. 

Information that you provide while using products such as Message Boards and Excite Chat is available for all to see - discretion should be used in entering personally identifiable information within such forums as it may be collected by third-parties leading - this is a leading source of unwanted email, for instance. The Excite does not associate with customer records any information entered by its customers in our Excite Mail, Message Boards, or Excite Chat products.

And finally, the Excite does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those Internet domains that are part of the Excite itself. We do, however, encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one.

**What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?**

The Excite does offer you the ability to control our email contacts to you. It is our intention to give you as much control over the relationship as possible. At each registration page we ask you for the following information: 

  1. You can tell us if you want to be listed in our Member Directory. If you indicate that this is acceptable, the following information from your registration form is added to the Member Directory: Your user name, email address, city, state and gender. For your safety, your actual name and street address is never included as part of a Member Directory listing.

  2. You can tell us if you want to receive communication from the Excite - these include email newsletters announcing new features, explaining valuable new content, or announcing fun contests.

  3. You can tell us if you want to receive communication from third-party companies who offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you. 




At times, the Excite may enter into cobranding arrangements with other companies and if so, an opt-in question may be present for contact from these firms as well. Their opt-out features are specific to each organization but you should never receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All email from the Excite Network or from cobrand partners who gain permission from you to send commercial email to you will include an opportunity to opt-out of future communications.

The Excite does reserve the right to send infrequent service alert messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. An example would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned. This right does not allow us to contact you to suggest you try a new service if you have asked us not to do so and issuance of a service alert is extremely rare. 

**What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control?**

The Excite Network operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission.
