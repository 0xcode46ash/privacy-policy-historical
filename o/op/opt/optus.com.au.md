# Optus - About Optus - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy sets out the approach which Optus will take in relation to the treatment of Personal Information. It includes information on how Optus collects, uses, discloses and keeps secure, individuals' Personal Information. It also covers how Optus makes the Personal Information it holds available for access to and correction by the individual.

This policy has been drafted having regard to Optus' obligations under the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Privacy Act 1988 (including the National Privacy Principles) ( **the Privacy Act** ). Nothing in this Policy changes Optus' existing obligations under the credit reporting requirements of the Privacy Act.

This Policy is a public document and has been prepared in light of National Privacy Principle 5, Openness.

**1\. Collection**

1.1 Optus will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary for Optus to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context, "collect" means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances where the individual is identifiable or identified.

1.2 Optus collects Personal Information **primarily** to supply customers with the products and services ordered from it and its related companies. Optus also collects and uses Personal Information for **secondary** purposes including:

(i) billing and account management;  
(ii) business planning and product development; and  
(iii) to provide individuals with information about promotions, as well as the products and services of other Optus companies and other organisations.

1.3 Optus will notify individuals (including, but not limited to, our customers) of the matters listed below before collecting any Personal Information:

i) the main reason that we are collecting Personal Information (this reason will be the **Primary Purpose** );  
ii) other related Uses or Disclosures that we may make of the Personal Information ( **Secondary Purposes** );  
iii) our identity and how individuals can contact us, if this is not obvious;  
iv) that individuals can access the Personal Information that Optus holds about them;  
v) that individuals should contact our customer service department (even if they are not a customer) if wish to access or correct Personal Information collected by us or have any concerns in relation to Personal Information;  
vi) the organisations or types of organisations to whom we usually Disclose the Personal Information including Related Bodies Corporates and contractors;  
vii) where applicable, any law that requires the Personal Information to be collected (for example, information that is required to be collected for the Integrated Public Number Database which is used by directory publishers);  
viii) the consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the Personal Information is not provided to Optus.

1.4 Where it is not practicable for Optus to notify individuals of all of the Collection Information before the collection of Personal Information, Optus will ensure that individuals are notified of the Collection Information as soon as possible after the collection. Optus will provide "post collection notification" in those circumstances where it is not practicable to notify individuals about the collection of their personal information before it is collected.  
1.5 When collecting Personal Information over the telephone, it may not always be practicable to provide all the Collection Information at that time. In such circumstances, we will provide the individual with Optus' contact details, and then provide the balance of the Collection Information in a confirming letter.  
1.6 Optus will not collect Sensitive Information from individuals except with consent and only where it is necessary for Optus to collect such information for an activity or function.  
1.7 Optus will not collect Personal Information secretly or in an underhanded way.  
1.8 Optus will take steps to ensure that individuals on purchased lists are or have been notified of the information as outlined at 1.3.

**2\. Use**

2.1 Optus will obtain an individual's consent for Use of non-sensitive Personal Information for Secondary Purposes at the time of collection, unless the Use is a related Secondary Purpose which would be within the relevant individual's Reasonable Expectations.  
2.2 Optus Uses Personal Information primarily for the purposes listed in 1.2 above.  
2.3 If Optus relies on the Direct Marketing exception to Direct Market to individuals it will ensure that:  
i) individuals are clearly notified of their right to Opt Out from further Direct Marketing;  
ii) there is only one Use of the information before the Opt Out right is given and this Use applies across all Optus' Related Bodies Corporate (if the information is shared between those Related Bodies Corporate);  
iii) the individual is given an Opt Out in all further instances of Direct Marketing if they have not previously chosen to Opt Out; and  
iv) if the individual Opts Out of all Direct Marketing the Opt Out will be respected by Optus and all its Related Bodies Corporate.  
2.4 Optus will not use Sensitive Information for Direct Marketing.  
2.5 Optus may use Personal Information to avoid an imminent threat to a person's life or to public safety. It may also use Personal Information for reasons related to law enforcement or internal investigations into unlawful activities.  
2.6 Optus will not use Personal Information without taking reasonable steps to ensure that the information is accurate, complete and up to date.  
2.7 Optus will not attempt to match de-identified or anonymous data collected through surveys or such online devices as "cookies", with information identifying an individual, without the consent of the relevant individual.

3.2 Optus may Disclose Personal Information between Related Bodies Corporate. Where information is Disclosed to such a Related Body Corporate, that Related Body Corporate is bound by the original Primary Purpose for which the information was collected.  
3.3 Optus may Disclose Personal Information to unrelated third parties to enable outsourcing of functions (such as billing), where that is Disclosure or Use for a related Secondary Purpose and has been notified to individuals or where such Disclosure is within the individual's Reasonable Expectations. Individuals will be notified of Optus' usual Disclosures via the Collection Information, as outlined in 1.3.  
3.4 Optus will take reasonable steps to ensure that its contracts with third parties include requirements for third parties to comply with the Use and Disclosure requirements of the Privacy Act.  
3.5 Optus may Disclose Personal Information to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, courts or external advisers where permitted or required by law.  
3.6 Optus may Disclose Personal Information to avoid an imminent threat to a person's life or to public safety.  
3.7 Optus may Disclose Personal Information to third parties involved in the sale or transfer of assets of the business including unpaid debts.  
3.8 If a Disclosure is not for a Primary Purpose; is not for a related Secondary Purpose; or upfront consent has not been obtained, Optus will not Disclose Personal Information otherwise than in accordance with the exceptions set out at 3.1 to 3.6 above.  
3.9 Optus does not generally sell or share its customer lists on a commercial basis with third parties but if it did, it would only do so if we had the appropriate consent of the individual involved. If the consent provided is conditional, Optus will take steps to ensure (by contract) that the use of its customer list by third parties does not exceed the scope of the consent.
