### **What Information Do We Collect?**

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site, read pages or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit: 

  * internet domain (for example, Ayouragency.gov@ if you connect from a government domain, Ayourschool.edu@ if you connect from a university's domain, or Axcompany.com@ if you use a private Internet access account) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site;
  * type of browser and operating system you use to access our site;
  * date and time you access our site;
  * pages you visit; and
  * links you used to arrive at our web site (if you came from another web site including the address of that web site). 



We do not track or permanently record information about you or your visits. We use the information listed above to: 

  * help us make our site more useful to visitors;
  * learn about the number of visitors to our site;
  * learn about the types of technology our visitors use; and
  * develop procedures to better protect our site from damage or unauthorized use. 



### **Do We Use "Cookies"?**

A "cookie" is a small text file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit a web site. When you visit our web site we want you to know: 

  * we do not allow any "third party" cookies;
  * we do not allow cookies that will remain on your hard drive after you leave our web site (often called "persistent" cookies); and
  * we may place a temporary cookie (often called a "session" cookie) on your hard drive to facilitate the operation and access to some of our web pages. This cookie is erased when you leave our web site. 



### **What If You Send Personal Information To Us?**

You may choose to provide us with personal information, for example by sending an email to one of our online email boxes, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our web site. We treat your emails the same way we treat letters you send to us. 

  * If you provide us with personal information, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you requested.
  * We collect personally identifiable information (for example, name, email address, Social Security number or other unique identifier) only if you specifically and knowingly provide it to us.
  * We will only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide nor do we give it to any private organizations.
  * We do not collect information for commercial marketing.



### **What Happens When You Access OtherWeb Sites Through Links on this Web Site?**

Our web site has links to other Federal agencies. We also link to other organizations= web sites when we have a good business reason to do so. This does not constitute an endorsement of their policies or products. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy and the "cookie" policy of the new site. 

### **How Do We Ensure Site Security?**

We ensure that our web site remains available to all users by using a Government computer system that employs software programs to: 

  * monitor network traffic;
  * identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information; and 
  * prevent access that could otherwise cause damage to our web site.
