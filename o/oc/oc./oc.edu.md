**Information you provide to us:**

How Oklahoma Christian University will use the information you provide on this web site:

  1. We will not sell or rent your information to any third-party for any purpose not enumerated in this list.

  2. We may provide your information to a third-party for limited, specific OC-related solicitations for the direct benefit of the university. (For example, to compile a directory) 
  3. We may provide your information to a third-party for the purpose of sending you OC-related materials. For example, we may have a mailing house assemble a large mailing and we would provide a mailing list for that purpose.

**Information your computer sends to us:**

**IP Address:** When you browse this web site or any web site, you leave a unique signature called an IP address. That address can be traced back to your computer. We only track IP addresses when a user attempts to compromise our network security. We may assemble information about usage patterns from the IP address your computer sends to us, but we will not identify you personally.

**Cookies** : We may place a file on your computer called a "cookie" which allows us to customize the information we send to you. Our website can later read this cookie. These cookies will identify your computer, but we do not track them, nor will we use them to identify you. 

We may place a cookie on your computer that will allow us to greet you by name when you customize the alumni or admissions web sites. We could theoretically use these cookies to track when you visited, what pages you visited, and how often you visit our web sites. We do not use cookies in this way. 

**Age of respondents:**

[Federal law prohibits us](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) from accepting identifying information from any person under thirteen years of age. If you are **under** thirteen years of age, you **may not provide us** any identifying information.
