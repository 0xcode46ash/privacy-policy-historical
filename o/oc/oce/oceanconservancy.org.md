By registering for the International Coastal Cleanup on Ocean Conservancy’s website, you are authorizing us to provide your name and contact information to the Cleanup organizer who will contact you. Most Cleanup organizers are volunteers, and not staff of Ocean Conservancy.

**Internet Protocol Address:  
** We collect an IP address from all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Use of "Cookies":**   
Our Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that Web site and are used for record-keeping purposes at many Web sites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Site will not function properly when you view them.

**Security:  
** All information provided to Ocean Conservancy is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Ocean Conservancy. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

**Advocacy:  
** When responding to one of our advocacy alerts through our Site, your name and address (and email address, depending on message delivery method) is included in the message sent to the targeted decision maker. This practice is the same as if you were sending a hand written letter to government official with your name and address on it. We do not share your contact information other than in this manner and for this purpose.

**Tell-A-Friend:**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Ocean Conservancy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. Ocean Conservancy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site for which Ocean Conservancy has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.
