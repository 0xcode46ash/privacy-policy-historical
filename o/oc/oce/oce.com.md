When you want access to certain restricted site areas or place an order with us, Océ requires you to supply personally identifiable information. Océ shall maintain the confidentiality/privacy of this information disclosed by you in these circumstances, disclosing the same only to its employees who need to know such information for purposes of enabling Océ to perform the orders or for purposes as to inform you of product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services from Océ, or to any authority if required so by law. Personally identifiable information will not obtain access to any part of the public areas of our sites and will not be sold to other organisations. Océ takes reasonable steps that this policy is followed within our company to protect your personally identifiable information with secure servers, from simple name registration to encrypted financial data used in e-commerce transactions.   
Any other material, information, and ideas (Transmissions) which you transmit to this site shall be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. Besides, any personally identifiable information that is disclosed by you through for example chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or newsgroups made available to you by Océ, becomes public information. Océ shall have no obligations of any kind with respect to the Transmissions or personally identifiable information that is disclosed in these areas. Océ will be free to disclose, copy, reproduce and distribute and otherwise use the Transmissions and the ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained therein for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes.

If you do not want to be recognised please turn to your Internet Browser to remove cookies from your computer hard drive, to hold all cookies, or to receive a warning before a cookie is saved.

Océ shall not be responsible in any way for the content or the privacy practices employed of such other sites. Océ provides such "links" only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any "link" to any such sites does not imply endorsement by Océ of the content of such sites.
