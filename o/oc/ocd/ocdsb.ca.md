# Privacy - Ottawa-Carleton District School Board

**Privacy Commitment**  
The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board is committed to the careful management of personal information and protection of privacy.  The school district collects, uses, retains and discloses personal information in the course of meeting its statutory duties and responsibilities. All employees are responsible for the protection of personal, confidential, and sensitive information entrusted to them. 

The management of personal information collected by the OCDSB is done in accordance with the provisions of the Education Act, the [Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA)](https://www.ipc.on.ca/?redirect=https://www.ipc.on.ca/ "MFIPPA"), and the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), and any other applicable legislation.  Personal information will only be used for the purpose for which it is intended. The Board shall ensure that personal information is secured and protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and inadvertent destruction by adhering to safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. 

**Requesting Access to Personal Information**  


The OCDSB follows provincial legislation to protect the privacy of an individual's personal information. Upon request, individuals can access their personal information and will be given access to that information in accordance with privacy legislation, subject to any mandatory or discretionary exceptions.

The Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (MFIPPA) outlines the process for the public to access specific information from the school district. You can make a freedom of information request (FOI) by following a prescribed set of steps. You will need to complete some documentation, and pay a mandatory $5 application fee.  Depending on the request and the amount of time required to search and prepare the records, there may be a cost in addition to the application fee.
