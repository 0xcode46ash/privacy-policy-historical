# OC Connect Privacy Policy

We value our privacy and we respect your right to yours. We don't ask for any information we don't absolutely need to know and we don't share any information provided by our visitors with any third parties or use it for any sort of "marketing purposes". 

We never ask children we know to be under the age of thirteen for any personal information whatsoever without express permission from their parent or guardian. 

Our server does record each visitor's IP address, which is a number assigned to an individual computer so that the servers it contacts know where to send data. The only information available in an IP number is generally, the name of the user's Internet Service Provider and possibly the city they're connecting from. IP numbers can only be used to identify individual users by the ISP's issuing them. We use IP numbers to get a general idea of where our visitors are from. That's all we need to know. Other than that, our only use for IP numbers would be to report the occasional troublemaker to his or her provider. 

Any other information provided to us, such as e-mail address, home addr
