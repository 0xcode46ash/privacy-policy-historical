A.     We may collect your name, email or any other information you provide to us in connection with your registration for an account for the Service.  

B.     You may be automatically logged into other Services using the account you created for the Service, and we may share information across the Services.

C.     The information that we collect from your device every time you use the Service, such as device identifier, device type, language and region settings, timestamp, and calendar type we do not consider personally identifiable on its own.  If you create a user account for the Service, we may link to your user account all the information that we had previously collected in connection with your device and use of the Service.

D.     The Service may be location-enabled, and you may be sending us location information such as GPS data, which may reveal your actual location.  You will have the option to opt-out of sending such data through your device's location settings.

E.     We may collect data and analytics about the scope and duration of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.  This information includes, without limitation, characters you type, your search and browsing history, services and links you click, and pages and content you view. 

F.      If you create Content with the Service, or upload, link, or share Content using the Service, we may record the Content and associate it with a user account you have with the Service.  If you submit Content to us to be stored on our servers (or those of third-party providers with which we do business), we may collect data and information regarding the nature or composition of that content (i.e., elements in a room). 

G.     The Service may have various preferences to customize the user experience (for example, which accounts on other sites such as Twitter or Facebook that you prefer to share content on), and we may collect and maintain these preferences either on the device, on our servers, or those of third-party providers with which we do business.

H.     We may keep a record of your various actions during usage of the Service including using such methods as cookies and single pixel images. These records may be kept on your device, on our servers or on the servers of third-party providers with which we do business depending on which part of the Service you are using.  This information will primarily be used to personalize your experience and for the internal purpose of improving the Service, and only ever displayed or shared publicly in an aggregate manner.

I.       We may collect information from third party sources and associate it with your device or an account you have on the Service, for example, we may pull in your full name from Facebook or Twitter if you connect those accounts with your account on the Service.  You should review, and if necessary, adjust, your privacy settings on any third party sites prior to linking or connecting them to the Services. 

J.       If you provide us with any other information (feedback, surveys, resumes) we may collect that information as well.  If you post or upload any photos, videos, articles, or comments, we may collect those as well. 

4.      Advertising.    
  


A.     Occipital-owned or operated websites ("Occipital Websites") may use Google Analytics or similar analytic tools, to help analyze how users use the site. The tool uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website(s) (including IP address) is transmitted to Google or other third parties. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website(s) and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Occipital, Inc. We do not use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any information that personally identifies visitors to our site(s). Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. We will not associate any data gathered from the Occipital Websites with any information that personally identifies you from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website. You may prevent the collection and processing of cookie-generated data regarding your use of this website (including your IP address) by Google by [downloading this browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) and installing it.

B.     Occipital Websites may use the Google AdWords remarketing feature to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies for this purpose. By combining first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) ads are optimized and served based on your past visits to our website. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCjiWUL8zENEjJp7XPqt5520UjtX-taBxz9ktLNx2jbCn2eklCVOWHIYwr55CSovSMLEKeZ3w-oB14tgzbZdDivPlXZFEjzIJzd-prPozRBn2tlZiqk9HjH98DxSFwhuC0TMPAJrzH1CElMTDMuxYhsymR8fAzsJR6hwU6u1Z9wAPuqyZEOmAGt2Pw4tbtptetyKVXSy7x5uOlbpCtNBf8Hys1yS86_dWmm18GonKz6AZhLa6wfRGPNfqcHXH-IwvI2Z0V9n). Furthermore you can opt-out from receiving advertising based on third-party cookies (such as DoubleClick cookies) by using the tool provided on the [English webpage of NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

C.     We use a technology called Facebook Conversion Tracking. This allows us to track those visitors who have been referred through a Facebook page, application or advertisement and then contacted us through this website within a 30-day period. We will share information regarding your visit to our website with Facebook but this will not include any information specific to your application or other personal information. Facebook will use this information to monitor on our behalf the effectiveness of our advertising and applications. The information we share with Facebook will only be used in accordance with Facebook's data use policy [facebook.com/about/privacy](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy). Facebook Conversion Tracking may also enable us and our partners to serve ads on and off Facebook.

D.     We do not respond to browser-based "do not track" signals. Some third party sites who push content to our site do keep track of your browsing activities over time and across different websites when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

4.      Uses of information collected.

A.     We primarily use information collected from you to improve and personalize your experience with the Service.  We may also use your information to connect you, at your request, with partners who may be able to provide you complementary services to ours. In the event that you opt into sharing your information with a third party through the Service, your information shall be subject to their terms of service and privacy policies. Occipital disclaims any responsibility for how your information is handled by said third party. 

B.     We may use the information for support, to develop new features, and to improve the overall quality of any of our Services, and we may also use it to improve and develop similar or other services. For example, we may analyze your data to determine where the Service has difficulty scanning an item or space, or we may use it or reprocess it for our internal product testing. We may use your Content, and any derivatives thereof, to extrapolate metrics to other content and provide you with advertising or other promotional offers.

C.     We may use information such as email to communicate with you for certain necessary reasons as account creation, forgotten passwords, security announcements, and notifications related to usage of the Service. Additionally, we may also occasionally send you promotional messages.

D.     We may also display the information collected in a non-personally identifiable, aggregate form for purposes such as demonstrating usage patterns or the effectiveness of a particular feature of the Service.  Occipital may use or share any anonymized or aggregated information for any purpose in its discretion. 

E.     We do NOT sell or rent any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party; except that we may sell or transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties in connection with any merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in capital structure or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Occipital, Inc. 

F.      With your explicit, opt-in approval, we may share Content submitted or captured in the service with third parties for research or educational purposes. In the event that you decide to share Content for this purpose, you will be presented with a separate notice which describes what information will be used and how it will be displayed, and that notice shall take priority over this agreement for the information shared. 

G.     If you choose to share any information or Content (including Modified Content) in a publicly viewable format on our website or Service, we may use that information or Content (including Modified Content) for any purpose in our discretion, including without limitation our or our third party partner's marketing purposes.

5.      Information sharing and onward transfer

B.     If you decide to use third party services in conjunction with the Service, any information those third party services collect fall under their own privacy policy that you should review, since our Policy does not apply.

C.     Occipital uses third party services for a few select purposes such as email deliverability, to create Modified Content (as defined in the Terms of Use at <http://occipital.com/legal/terms>), to process payments, to conduct quality assurance testing, to provide technical support, or to otherwise facilitate your use of  or our management of the Services.  In these cases, third party service providers will be limited only to the personal information deemed necessary, in Occipital's sole discretion to provide their service and we will make reasonable commercial effort to ensure their usage is in line with our Policy.

D.     The Service may allow you to interact and share your information with others.  Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal information or data. Unless stated otherwise, Occipital disclaims any responsibility for the protection or use of your data while in the possession of any third parties with whom you choose to share.

E.     Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"), we may in the future.  We may share some or all of your information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Policy.  If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your information collected by us as described in this Policy.

F.      Regardless of any choices you make regarding your information (as described below), we may disclose information if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of us or users of the services.
