### BROWSING OCRA WORLDWIDE WEBSITES

If you visit any OCRA Worldwide Website and do not complete any online forms or communicate with us in any other way, you should note that: Members of OCRA Worldwide will not collect or retain any personal data from web visitors who view pages on our websites and do not complete online forms or communicate with us in any other way. 

Our servers will seek to place a cookie on your computer so that we may track statistics relating to new and repeat visitors and other information which is not personally identifiable. A cookie is a piece of data placed on a user's hard drive containing information that enables unique web visitors to be identified for the purposes of analysing user interaction with a website. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We do not seek to associate cookies with the completion of online forms. We use cookies to track how visitors move through our sites and how often they visit. On most browsers, you can elect to decline to accept cookies. Should you decline to accept cookies your browsing experience will not be degraded. 

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer our websites, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and utilise online forms and processes.
