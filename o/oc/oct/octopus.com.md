**Octopus privacy statement  
**Octopus respects the privacy of its users and the security of the data that users provide.  This privacy statement explains what type of information we collect from our users, what we do with that information, and how users can update and control the use of information provided to Octopus.  This policy may change in the future without further notice.  Users are responsible for regularly reviewing this policy so please be sure to check back frequently.

**What type of information do we collect?  
**Octopus’ corporate site document download registration and the Octopus Personal Edition registration require users to give us their contact information (name, e-mail address, and phone number) and company information (company name and address). We use the knowledge gained to modify products and services to meet users’ needs, the contact information for marketing and sales purposes, and the site registration form to personalize the user’s Octopus Web experience. 

Octopus also captures information from browser cookies. Cookies are files written to a user’s disk and read by the http server program so that the server program knows if the user has previously visited our site. This knowledge allows us to analyze our site, see what is successful or useful, and modify our site based on common needs.

We collect and store various kinds of personally identifying information ("Personal Information") from users for both the Octopus Personal Edition as well as on www.octopus.com for services such as unlimited use of the free Personal Edition as well as for downloads of whitepapers and data sheets (the "Service") on www.octopus.com. In addition to the information we specifically ask users to provide, we may also collect certain categories of information automatically as part of the operations of this Service, such as the Internet Protocol address of the user’s originating Internet Service Provider, or the type of browser the user is are using.  We also collect aggregate and individual information about the use of our Service, including which pages are most frequently visited, how many users visit the site daily, how long they stay on each page, and the types of content they select and view.  A brief description of the information that we collect follows:

**IP address** – The user’s IP address is a number that is assigned to the user’s computer by the Internet Service Provider each time the user logs onto the Internet. The IP address enables sites that the user may visit to send data such as the Web page to the user’s computer.  IP addresses are automatically gathered by our Web server and help us diagnose problems with our server, ultimately helping us administer the site.

**"Referrer"** \- A "referrer" is the information sent by the user’s Web browser that references the Web URL the user linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server.  This information may be used to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to users’ interests.

**Environment variables** \- Environment variables are things such as time, Web browser type, operating system or platform, and CPU speed. This information is generally used to ensure compatibility of our software with users’ systems and to identify broad demographic statistics.

**Cookies** \- Cookies are tiny text files stored on the customer's computer by the Web server and can be read only by the Web server that placed the file.  Users can set their browser to notify them when they receive a cookie, giving them the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.  Cookies are used for, among other things, remembering the state of the site when users have left it so that when the user returns, we can bring the user back into the same environment.  If the user chooses not to accept cookies, the user will still be able to use portions of the site, but the user experience will be significantly altered and some features might not function. Octopus uses [WebSideStory, Inc.](http://www.websidestory.com/) to accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information that helps us understand and analyze the Web site experience of our visitors. This information is stored in a cookie on your computer's hard drive. However, none of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall Web site or Internet usage trends. Please visit the [WebSideStory Privacy Center](http://www.websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?privacy&privacy&index). 

**GUIDs** \- A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is an alphanumeric identifier.  A GUID is used to indicate a unique installation of software and is found in many popular software applications.  GUIDs may be used for statistical purposes or to personalize the content, services, and promotions offered to the user on this site, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.  GUIDs may also be used to uniquely identify users of this site when they access it.

**Operating metrics** \- Information regarding the usage of the Software by users in aggregate such as the average amount of time spent on pages or click-throughs sent.  We may use the information to research users’ habits in aggregate and understand the popularity and effectiveness of the services we offer so we can improve them in the future.  We may also use the information on an individual basis to provide helpful tips or special offers (including paid advertising) that are targeted to our users.

**E-mail** \- We only collect users’ e-mail address during the sign up process.  If the user enters an e-mail for any other operation (such as sending a View) it is for the use of that function only and we will not store it.

In addition, Octopus will maintain the Octopus Views, communications or other content that are saved or transmitted by our users through our servers.  It is our policy not to disclose the content of private communications except as we believe necessary to comply with the law or legal process or government inquiry.

The user acknowledges that material available in publicly accessible areas of Octopus constitute public and not private communications and may be read by others without the user’s knowledge.  Users should always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about themselves or their children on or throughout the Octopus site.

**How do we use the information we collect?  
**We use user contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The user’s contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Use of browser cookies allows Octopus to provide a better, more relevant, user experience, as well as to regulate Web site functions such as the timing, frequency, and type of advertising. Cookies may also be used to automate entry into password protected parts of Octopus’ site, or to automate data entry functions, so that users don't have to reenter data with each visit.

**With whom do we share information?  
**Except as provided in this Privacy Statement and in our [Terms of Service](http://www.octopus.com/company/terms.htm), we will not share users’ personal information with any third party without their consent.  We may provide aggregate information about our users, Web site traffic, or related activity for purposes of marketing or promotion.

We may disclose information about our users if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Octopus or others.

Other companies that provide services on or through our Web site, or that advertise or link on our Web site, may use cookies or collect other information about our users when they go to their site.  Octopus does not control the collection or use of information by these companies.  Users should contact these companies directly if they have any questions about their collection or use of information about themselves.

**How is user information protected?  
**The accuracy and security of all user information is important to Octopus. While we cannot guarantee complete security, Octopus operates using state-of-the-art network, data, and physical security practices. We use industry standard procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of users’ personal information, such as firewalls, encryption, token authentication, application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network and its data. 

Access to and use of password protected and/or secure areas of the Octopus Support Web site is restricted to authorized users only. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password(s) they are given to access such areas of the site, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under their password(s). Users agree to notify Octopus immediately of any unauthorized use of their password(s). Unauthorized persons attempting to access these areas may be subject to prosecution.

**Special provisions for our non-U.S. customers  
**If the user is an individual resident of a country outside of the United States, please be aware that Octopus may collect, use and disclose personal data about the user on or throughout this Web site or as otherwise described in the Octopus Privacy Statement, or any amendments hereto.  Such data will be stored on servers located in the United States, which may have less stringent privacy practices than in the user’s resident country.  Furthermore, Octopus may transfer users’ personal data outside of their country of residence for purposes of processing their requests or providing our service or for other lawful business purposes.

**How to opt out or change information  
**Users can review or change the information they have provided to us on the registration page at any time by clicking on the ‘user profile' button that appears at the top of any page on the [Personal Edition site](http://my.octopus.com/).  From time to time, some information may be purged for system or other technical reasons at our sole discretion. 

Users may opt out of receiving information from Octopus by unselecting the appropriate fields from the user profile menu mentioned above.

**Consent  
**By using our Service, users consent to Octopus’ collection and use of information as described in this statement.  Should we change the way in which we use your personal information, we will get your consent before using your information in this new way.

**Questions or concerns?  
**Please feel free to contact us by e-mail at [privacy@octopus.com](mailto:privacy@octopus.com) if there are any questions or concerns about this privacy statement or about Octopus’ collection of user information.
