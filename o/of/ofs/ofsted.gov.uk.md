When we ask you for personal information we will keep to the law, including the Data Protection Act 1998 and we promise to:

  * make sure you know why we need it
  * only ask for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant information
  * protect it and make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
  * let you know if we share it with other organisations to give you better public services - and if you can say no
  * make sure we don’t keep it longer than necessary
  * not to make your personal information available for commercial use without your permission.



In return, we ask you to:
