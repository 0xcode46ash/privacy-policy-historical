#### Information we collect from visitors

We collect several kinds of information from visitors to oft.gov.uk depending on the part of the site being visited: email addresses, site usage information and, in a few cases, personal details such as your name and postal details if you order publications.

**Feedback**  
If you provide feedback on the OFT website through our [webeditor@oft.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:webeditor@oft.gsi.gov.uk) email address we will only use this information to develop and improve the site.

**Comments and questions**  
If you send an enquiry by email to a specific contact on the OFT website it may not always be possible for the OFT to provide the information requested directly. In such circumstances we may pass your enquiry to another government department so that they can respond to your information request.

**Email alerts  
** If you sign up to receive email alerts we will use the information you give us to provide the service(s) you have requested. We may occasionally contact email alert subscribers to help us evaluate and improve the service that we offer.

If you subscribe to the email alert service, you can correct, update or remove any personally identifiable information directly, via our internet pages. You can also inform us that you wish to cancel a subscription and we will remove you from our mailing list and delete your details from our records.

We will hold the information you have provided for as long as you require access to the service requested.
