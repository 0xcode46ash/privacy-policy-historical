 **How is my personal information secured?**

At OfficeMax.com, our secure server encrypts all payment information that you transmit to us while using our site. We use the latest 128-bit encryption technology to keep your personal information safe, including your user name, password, and credit card number and expiration date.

If your credit card provider holds you liable for some portion of the unauthorized charges, and if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted (through no fault of your own) from the use of your credit card to purchase through the secure server at OfficeMax.com, then OfficeMax will reimburse you for the liability up to a maximum of $50. 

Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution that receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.
