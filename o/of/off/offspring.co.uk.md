## Privacy Policy

At offspring.co.uk we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to progress orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status. 

We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order (for some international deliveries, this number may be given to our couriers). 

Offspring use many different industry standard security techniques to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. When you place orders or access your account information, you are connected to our secure server. We encrypt your information using SSL (secure socket layers) secure server software before it is sent to us. This ensures that your information can only be read by our secure server and cannot be unscrambled by any outside party. All credit card transactions are cleared using HSBC's banking system. 

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at www.offspring.co.uk possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. We do not sell trade or rent your personal information to others. The only time we will share you data is if you sign up to our mailing list and opt-in to receive information from companies of Offspring’s careful selection.

We will not use your information to share with outside companies unless you join our mailing list and opt-in to receive information from companies of Offspring’s careful selection.

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by offspring.co.uk. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
