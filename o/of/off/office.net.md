# Microsoft Office Tools on the Web Privacy Statement

**Microsoft Office Tools on the Web Privacy Statement**  
_This document was last updated_ _July 24, 2001_ _._

At Microsoft, we are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. Microsoft is a participant in the Safe Harbor Agreement between the United States and the European Union, and meets the Safe Harbor principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But, sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. By using this site, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

This statement covers Office Tools on the Web, including Design Gallery Live, Template Gallery, eServices, Product Updates, Assistance Center, and Download Center.

   
**Collecting information about you**  
Office Tools on the Web collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, when needed to provide a service you requested.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through public online forums, such as the Design Gallery Live Community, this information may be collected and used by others.

Information about your computer hardware and software is automatically collected by Office Tools on the Web and may be shared with other Web sites within the Microsoft family of Web sites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Office Tools on the Web for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the site.

Office Tools on the Web encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Tools on the Web so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use, and share information. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Microsoft domain.

   
**Use of personal information**  
We will use information about you for three primary purposes: 

  * To help you quickly find software, services or information on the Tools on the Web site.
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new services from Microsoft.

Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on this site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft, its Web sites, or the public.

Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

   
**Control of personal information**  
When you give us personal information, Office Tools on the Web will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

Office Tools on the Web may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues related to a product or service you requested. You can stop receiving these e-mails and delete personal information about you by following the instructions at the bottom of the e-mails.

Please be aware that this Privacy Statement and the choices you make on this site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products or services.

   
**Security of personal information**  
Office Tools on the Web strictly protects the security of personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. 

   
**Use of cookies**  
The Office Tools on the Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

When a customer visits the site, a cookie is placed on that customer's machine or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. To ensure that we are publishing content customers need and want, Office Tools on the Web collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individuals' use of the site.

   
**Use of Web beacons**  
Office Tools on the Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons -- sometimes called single-pixel gifs -- that allow Office Tools on the Web to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access personally identifiable information on the Office Tools on the Web site; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about Web site usage.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Microsoft Office Tools on the Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partner, MSN, to help Office Tools on the Web determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.

   
**Use of third-party ad networks**  
Office Tools on the Web allows third-party ad servers or ad networks to display advertisements on the Office Tools on the Web site. To do this, ad networks place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Office Tools on the Web does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

If you want to prevent one of these third-party companies from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline third party cookies or all cookies, or you may visit each ad network's Web site individually and request that you be removed from its system.

   
**Changes to this statement**  
We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Statement. For material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our Web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
