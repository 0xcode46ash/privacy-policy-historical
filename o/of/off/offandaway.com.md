Last Updated:  May 20, 2010 ****

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Off andAway, Inc. ("Off & Away") with respect to the use of our website, located at [www.offandaway.com](http://www.offandaway.com/) (the "Site").

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.  We will alert you to these changes by indicating the date that the Policy was last updated.  We encourage you to review this Policy regularly to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. 

**What Is Personal Information?**

As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address, or credit card or other account number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**

We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Site.  We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account, purchase bids or bid packages, apply used bids, make a travel reservation, fill out a form, send us an email, or request information.  This information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, contact information and credit card or other billing information. 

Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with participating in a contest, promotion, or survey on the Site.  We also collect information regarding your activity on the Site, such as your bidding history, auctions participated in, auctions won/lost, prices paid, bids used, items purchased and other similar information associated with your account. ** __**

When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected.  For example, we log information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, address of a referring website, and your activity on the Site.  We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with, or link it to, any of the identifying information mentioned above.  Otherwise, it is used only in the aggregate.

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.  Among other things, cookies help us improve our Site and your experience.  If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information.  If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services on our Site.  Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site.  **__**
