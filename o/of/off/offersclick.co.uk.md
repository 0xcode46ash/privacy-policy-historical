# Privacy Practices | Dell UK

### Privacy and Data Security

At Dell, your right to privacy and security is a major concern. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting your personal information. Please read the following very carefully.

### Dell's Privacy Policy

Dell respects your privacy. Across our business, around the world, we will only collect, store and use your personal information for defined purposes. We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you, for example, to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share product, service and company news and offerings with you. We do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal data outside the Dell family of companies with your consent, as required by law or to protect Dell, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help Dell fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. At any time you may contact Dell with any privacy questions or concerns you may have. You also may ask at any time to see the personal data you have given us and request correction or deletion. We strive to protect the security of your personal data by use of appropriate measures and processes.

### The Information Dell Collects About You

Dell only asks for specific types of personal information. We ask you to provide information that will enable us to process your purchase or provide services to you, enhance your site visit, respond to requests for information, support our customer relationship, assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your visit.

Dell may collect information when you:

  * Register on a Dell or Dell affiliate website;
  * Request a quote for products and/or services;
  * Place an order for products and/or services;
  * Request e-mail notification of your order status (called "Order Watch");
  * Request assistance from our "Product Advisor";
  * Fill out a support request or request telephone technical support services;
  * Provide feedback in an online survey;
  * Participate in promotional offers;
  * Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list; or
  * Visit a Dell website or an affiliate website



In each of the instances above, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address, IP address, phone number, occupation, industry, transactional information such as your preferences, customer and service tag number, service history, credit card information and other bank details, referrals, and other information that is needed to process your purchase, provide requested services or register you for or subscribe you to services or offers.

We may collect information relating to your use of those websites (including, for example, your IP address, the pages you view and the links and advertisements that you click on) so that we can offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Dell and better serve your needs by customising the content, services and marketing material that we share with you. 

### Dell only uses your personal information for specific purposes

The information you provide will be kept confidential and is collected and processed for the following general purposes or for other legitimate purpose provided for by applicable law.

  * To process your purchase or provide requested services
  * To fulfill requests for products and services
  * To improve our products and services
  * To contact you; and
  * To customise our communication with you and the marketing material we share with you.



### Newsletters, Mailing lists, Requests For Information

If you request, we (or another Dell entity or any agent working on behalf of Dell ) will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services that may be of interest to you. Such information may encompass alerts to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from Dell. Only Dell (or agents working on behalf of Dell) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings any longer, simply notify us by:

Please allow up to 10 business days for your email choices to take effect. Because some marketing, such as direct mail catalogues, are developed in advance, you may receive an additional catalogue after we receive your request.

### When Dell Will Share Your Personal Information

Your information may be shared with other Dell entities, agents or contractors performing services for Dell, such as Dell's Service Providers, marketing sub-contractors, financial institutes. If so, Dell will seek to ensure that the information is only used in connection with the functions these parties will be performing for Dell and that all such information is treated in a confidential manner.

Dell will disclose your personal information to the extent required or authorized by applicable law, if ordered or required to do so by a court or governmental authority as appropriate in each jurisdiction, or to ensure that we are in compliance with our legal obligations.

Dell may transfer your personal information to affiliated companies, such as Dell Computer Corporation in the United States. In order to provide for adequate protection of your personal information, we have in place contractual arrangements with such affiliated companies.

### Dell will not disclose your personal information to any outside organization for its own marketing use without your consent

Personal information regarding you (such as name, address and phone number) or your order and the products you purchase will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its own use in marketing or solicitation without your consent.

### Your rights

Upon your request and within 40 days we will inform you about the type of personal information we hold about you, the purposes for which we hold it and the possible recipients or types of recipients. Upon written request and within a reasonable period of time we will also correct, delete and/or block personal information from further processing if that information proves to be factually inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant to the purpose(s) of the processing.

### Internet Commerce

The online store at [www.dell.co.uk](http://www.dell.co.uk/) is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail, and any other information you provide us. Dell is committed to keeping the information collected on our site secure. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption, (please see Dell's [Store Security](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/topics/footer/privacy?c=uk&l=en&s=gen&~section=002) page for details on these security measures). If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may place an order without credit card information and a representative will contact you. Alternatively, you may always contact a sales representative by telephone. It has always been our policy to contact customers in the event of a potential problem with your purchase or any normal business communication regarding your purchase. 

### Customised Experience

We use technology to help us deliver customised visitor experiences. At Dell, we primarily use Dell and third party "cookies" to help us determine which service support and marketing information is appropriate to your machine and to maintain your shopping experience in our online store. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain some limited characteristics about you, such as what type of computer you are using, but beyond that, our use of cookies is intended simply to provide you with a better experience when using [www.dell.co.uk](http://www.dell.co.uk/) and to serve you advertising about Dell products and services when visiting the Dell website and other websites. Dell has no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy while using the Dell site. For more information about our use of cookies (including how to delete or refuse cookies), please [click here](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/topics/footer/privacy?c=uk&l=en&s=gen&~section=004). 

### Web Beacons

We, or third parties acting on our behalf, may use web beacons on our site, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other sites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or e-mail. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our site and our advertising in various ways, for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our site from a particular advertisement or make a purchase from our site after viewing a particular advertisement as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an e-mail message, determining when an e-mail message is opened and determining how many times an e-mail is forwarded.

The information we collect may include some limited personal information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing Dell cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customise content on our website and internal research purposes.

We do not allow third parties to place their own web beacons on our site or in our advertisements unless they are providing services to Dell and acting on our behalf. We will not share any personal information collected through web beacons with any third party, except for service providers who act on our behalf and who are contractually prohibited from any other use or disclosure of the information.

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.

### Third-Party Sites

Please be aware that other Web sites including sites that may be accessed through our site, e.g., via a hyperlink, may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party web sites linked to [www.dell.co.uk](http://www.dell.co.uk/) or any other site. We use the [symbol](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm) to mark links to third-party sites. 

### Additional Information

If you have requested to be contacted by Dell's ISP partner in order to initiate a return call, we will need to provide them with your contact details. This information will not be shared with any other party and will be forwarded to your preferred ISP partner for the sole purpose of allowing them to contact you. Personal data obtained from you is held and processed in accordance with all applicable laws and consistently with Dell's privacy policy.
