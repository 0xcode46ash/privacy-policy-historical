## Officeworks Website Privacy and Security

### Our commitment to keeping your trust

We appreciate that you may have certain concerns about how personal information is collected, used and shared. We can assure you that we will always handle your personal information securely and carefully. Among other things, we strictly comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws. 

### Why we collect information

We collect information so that we can provide you with a great service. We need this information to deliver products and services to you, to complete transactions on your behalf and to better understand your requirements and preferences.

This information also allows us to provide you with offers that are of greater interest or benefit to you.

### How we collect this information

We store your registration and ordering detail so that you don't have to re-enter your details every time you shop with us. And sometimes we add to your personal information with data from external sources. This is usually only done to verify the accuracy of the information we have, and to personalise and improve our services. Generally, the personal information we collect is supplied by you.

### What we collect

The information we collect includes your name, business name, address, delivery address, phone number and e-mail address. We also have access to purchasing information through our business partners.

### Sharing your information

We may need to pass personal details such as your name, business name and address to service providers who perform some of our deliveries. This may include major delivery companies, outsourced call-centres, mail houses and third party fulfilment contractors.

Officeworks is committed to reducing the amount of fraud it faces. Our policy is that we will investigate any cases of fraud that we identify. As a first time customer for example, you may receive a telephone call or email requesting more information/proof to confirm the details that you have supplied to us. In such cases, your delivery may be delayed by up to 24 hours. If any of the information you supply is found to be false or misleading, we will, if we deem it appropriate, report this to the appropriate authorities for them to investigate.

In special circumstances, for example if we sell our business, your information may be transferred as part of that sale. We will not use your information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide without your consent.

From time to time, we may provide data to other business partners for various purposes such as marketing research. In this situation we make it impossible to identify who you are.

If you would like to access your personal information, please email your request via [Contact us](https://web.archive.org/retail/landing/Contact-Us) or phone us on 1300-OFFICE (633 423).

### Security

We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. After all, it is in our interests to make sure you feel confident shopping with us online.

Only specially cleared team members in our Customer Service Centre and in Marketing, Stores, Finance and IT have access to our customers' personal information. Their access is subject to strict controls and procedures.

Our e-commerce sites use a security measure called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL locks all your critical information in an encrypted envelope, making it extremely difficult for this information to be intercepted. Our SSL technology is the industry standard in Internet security.
