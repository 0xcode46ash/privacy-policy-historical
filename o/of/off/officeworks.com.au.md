# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

  * This Privacy Policy is the Officeworks Ltd official privacy policy and it applies to all personal information collected by Officeworks. In this policy we explain how and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, and what controls you have over our use of it.
  * We appreciate that you may have certain concerns about how personal information is collected, used and shared. We can assure you that we will always handle your personal information securely and carefully. Among other things, we comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws.



### Collection of Information

  * Some information provided to us by customers, contractors and other third parties might be considered private or personal. We collect information so that we can provide you with a great service.

    * When you submit your e-mail address to our website mailing list;

### Use of information collected and disclosure of personal information to others

  * We may use or disclose personal information held about an individual for the primary purpose for which it is collected (e.g. provision of our services, including administration of our services, notification to you about changes to our services, record-keeping following termination of our services to you and technical maintenance) - that is, to carry on our business and provide services to our customers. We may also use such information for a purpose related to the primary purpose of collection and where you would reasonably expect that we would use the information in such a way (e.g. major delivery companies, mail houses and third-party fulfilment contractors). This information is only disclosed to persons outside our business in the circumstances set out in this policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection of the information, or with your permission.
  * In addition we are permitted to use or disclose personal information held about you: 
    * Where you have consented to the use or disclosure;
    * Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious, immediate threat to someone's health or safety or the public's health or safety;
    * Where we reasonably suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure is a necessary part of our investigation or in reporting the matter to the relevant authorities;
    * Where such use or disclosure is required under or authorised by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena, a warrant or other order of a court or legal process);
    * Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary for prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of crimes or wrongdoings or the preparation for, conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal or the implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal by or on behalf of an enforcement body.
    * Where you have requested a service (e.g. furniture installation, assembly or product rental) and we are required to disclose the information to the third party in order to facilitate the provision of the service.
  * There are some specific products and services we offer and we share your information as follows:
