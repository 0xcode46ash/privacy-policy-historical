## Our Promises to You

Thank you for visiting Officevibe. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust. Spam e-mail is the bane of the internet and we won't have anything to do with it.

## Personally Identifiable Information

We collect the personally identifiable information that you submit on the registration and user profile forms to permit you access to our site and to enable credit card verification, where applicable.

If you do not feel comfortable with others knowing this information, then leave it blank.

Generally, the information Officevibe collects helps us to communicate with you regarding media licensed from or to you. For instance, we use your email address to provide you with an email confirmation of your registration and to notify you of information concerning your media on our site. In addition, users on the site will be able to communicate with you via a confidential form on the site, but they will not know your e-mail address or other personal identification information aside from your username (and therefore will not be able to add you to spam lists, etc). We will not share, rent or sell your personally-identifiable information with any entity, subject to the provisions below. We may share your information with our vendors in connection with system maintenance and other services that these individuals or entities perform for us. In some cases, we may run a joint marketing effort with third parties.

We will only release personal information without your authorization in the following situations:

  * To the authorities when necessary to comply with the law (i.e. answering subpoenas).
  * To enforce or to apply our Terms of Use and other agreements (including our Member Agreement).
  * To protect the rights, property, or safety of Officevibe.com, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
