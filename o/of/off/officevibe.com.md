## Branding

In an effort to protect our trademark from being diluted, in accordance with USA law, we have established the following branding guidelines that discuss how our logo and icons may be used.

## Officevibe Application

NOTE: In general if you use Officevibe as part of a third party app and it comes with an Officevibe logo already built into it (e.g., our app for web or mobile), then that logo and associated branding already meets our guidelines. This guide is for reference should you want to make any changes or use the logo in a different way.

## Please don't:

Alter and display the Officevibe logo without our prior written consent. Include a version of the Officevibe logo in your app in such a way that it appears to be an endorsement of your app. Include a version of the Officevibe logo in any app that includes materials that are potentially offensive (i.e. promotes hatred or bigotry), adult only in nature (i.e. porn), or illegal in the USA (i.e. copyrighted material). Our brand is family-friendly in nature and we want to make sure there is never any external confusion about which material Officevibe does or does not endorse. Include a version of the Officevibe logo in your app that is bigger than your own logo. Include a version of the Officevibe logo in your press announcements or promotional materials without Officevibe's prior written consent.
