12. Please refer to our [U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/en-us/legal/consumer-privacy-notice) for more information about how we share information and your options for limiting our sharing.  

Note that we do not provide an opt-out choice for information uses in support of our everyday business purposes, such as to process transactions, maintain accounts, perform information technology functions, respond to court orders and legal investigations, report to credit bureaus, or offer our products and services, because these disclosures are necessary to run our everyday business.

13. OFX retains your personal information for so long as our relationship remains active and to fulfill the purposes listed in Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 (above).  Where lawful to do so, we may destroy, erase or aggregate/anonymize your personal information when it is no longer required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
