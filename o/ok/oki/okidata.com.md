# Privacy Policy Statement

Policy Effective Beginning: March 15, 1999  
Last Updated: March 25, 2008 

Privacy Policy Statement

OKI Data is committed to ensuring the privacy of information provided to us by our customers and visitors. We have developed this privacy statement to provide you with the highest level of assurance of the security and privacy of your information as it pertains to these sites ([ www.okidata.com](http://www.okidata.com/), [my.okidata.com](http://my.okidata.com/), <http://www.myokidata.com/> and [esales.okidata.com](http://esales.okidata.com/)). 

OKI Data offers various opportunities for visitors to provide information on its site. This information can be broken down into two main categories. 

  1. The first is information necessary to complete a transaction or purchase (such as name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information). 
  2. The second type is optional information to help OKI Data understand the needs and desires of its customers, and in return for which OKI Data may provide the user the opportunity to enter contests and drawings, complete surveys, and/or receive promotional offers or special notifications, among other things. (This may include such information as company size, revenue, purchasing needs, opinions, purchase intentions or history, etc.). 
  3. The third type of information is required of registered participants posting information on the Oki Printing Solutions Support Forum where selected servicing dealers may exchange information about Oki Data products and services. Dealer personnel participating must provide their full name, title, password, company name, company phone number, service manager name, and service manager phone number as a condition of acceptance; final review and approval of all registrations is reserved by Oki Data. This information is viewable by other registered forum participants and Oki Data personnel. Participants may provide content for the forum. Oki Data will monitor all submissions to the forum and will exercise complete editorial control over all content, which may be then posted in its entirety, in an edited version, or not at all. Participants may also send private emails to other participants including Oki Data personnel. The terms and conditions of the forum are reviewed and accepted prior to participation.



**Changes in this Privacy Statement**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, and/or by means of a notice on our home page. 

Use of Information

OKI Data may share non-personal, summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties (such as web development partners, PR and Marketing agencies, channel partners, logistics/shipping partners, etc.). However, for partners or third parties under contract with OKI Data, any individual customer information provided shall be used only to perform or complete a necessary transaction or function related to the customer's purchase. These transactions or functions shall be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. OKI Data will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties mentioned above, without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, OKI Data does not sell registrant information to lists. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. In some cases, OKI Data may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue. Personal information may include name, address, telephone number, etc. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [[To learn more about SSL, follow this link](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&defl=en&q=define:SSL&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title).] 

When a visitor registers, the visitor will be given the opportunity to select whether or not to be included in the OKI Data mailing list. Inclusion on the mailing list may entitle the user to receive information or updates about special offers, programs, new products and/or services. Choosing not to register means the user will not be able to receive these benefits or this information. 

Links to other Sites

This site may contain links to third party web sites that are hosting services or information under the "okidata.com" domain. Any personal information collected by these third parties will be treated with the same level of privacy and security as that which is collected elsewhere on the OKI Data web site. 

Meanwhile, links to other web sites (outside of the "okidata.com" domain) are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by OKI Data of the contents on such third-party web sites. OKI Data has no control over and is not responsible for the content of linked third-party web sites and does not make any representations, guarantees or warranties of any products or services of the third party or the content or accuracy of materials on such third party web sites. If you decide to access linked third party web sites, you do so at your own risk. 

User Control

Customers and visitors who have purchased or registered in the OKI Store at <http://www.okidata.com/> have the ability to change, edit or delete their personal information online by logging in at the [member login page](http://esales.okidata.com/IWShowMemberPage.process?fromHomePage=). If OKI Data's privacy policies change in the future and the use of a users' personally identifiable information is used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, OKI Data will post a prominent notice on this web site 30 days prior to such changes going into effect. Additionally, if at any time a user wishes to be removed from future mailings, or change any personal information on any area of the OKI Data Web site, they may send email to [webmaster@okidata.com](mailto:webmaster@okidata.com), [support@okidata.com](mailto:support@okidata.com). To be removed, type "REMOVE" in the SUBJECT field. To change information, please state existing information and the change requested in the body of the message, or call 1-800-OKIDATA to request the changes be made. 

OKI Data takes every reasonable measure to ensure that the information it gathers from the user is accurate and remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access or use. OKI Data utilizes firewall technology to help ensure the security of your private information. 

Credit Card Information

Due to the financial nature of the information provided in the OKI Store on this site, OKI Data stores credit card information separately from other contact information gathered elsewhere in the site. This is done as an additional measure of securing your financial information. Because of this, a user may be requested to input some personal or contact information more than once. 

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments the user requests through this service and are not used for marketing, sales or other purposes. All credit card transactions are handled through an encrypted system with a secure online credit card processing company. 

Dispute Resolution

OKI Data will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the use of personal information. Please address any concerns to [webmaster@okidata.com](mailto:webmaster@okidata.com) who will respond to you within three (3) business days of receipt. We ask that you provide a short explanation of the situation and a return address or phone number where we can reach you during normal business hours. 

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow us to analyze our site traffic patterns and to provide a user-friendly registration and log-in process. A cookie can not give us access to your computer or to information beyond what you provide to us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. 

OKI Data uses cookies to enhance our site and its navigation, in order to customize, personalize and enhance the user experience. For example, by using cookies, OKI Data may be able to present information to the user, based on a specific OKI product they have purchased, or be able to provide only specific information the user requests, based on the preferences they previously indicated when registering. In most places, these cookies are tied to your personal information. 

Like many web sites, OKI Data may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements. 

Log Files

Like most standard Web sites, we also use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are used only to distinguish between OKI company employees and those who are not, and are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called WebTrends that uses log files to analyze user movement and provide general site statistics. 

Further questions regarding our privacy policy may be sent to [ webmaster@okidata.com](mailto:webmaster@okidata.com).
