## Summary

The Open Knowledge Foundation family of websites collects no more data about you than most other websites.

The supporter information you provide to us will be used by us in order to maintain a register of supporters and supply you with any goods and services you have requested from our web site.

For our interactive sites such as blogs and wikis in particular, edits, comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks are published, and except in very limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this site. If you decide to comment, link, or pingback to a post, you must keep this in mind.

Under the Data Protection Act, you may at any time request a copy of the information we hold on you (for which we may charge a small fee to offset our administration costs) by writing to us (see above).

This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time to time. You may wish to revisit it regularly.

## Supporter information

Thank you again for being a supporter. The supporter information you provide to us will be used by us in order to process your support, to maintain a register of supporters and supply you with any goods and services you have requested from our web site.

## Public data and publishing

Browsing this site doesn’t reveal your identity publicly, though see Private Logging later in this document for more information.

## Author identification

When posting a comment or editing a page in the wiki, a name and email address may be required. You do not have to select your real name or use your regular email address. Your email address will not published. If you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or attempt to use a remail service.

Page edits, comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks and other activity on our websites may be identified by your IP address. These numbers could potentially be traceable to identifying information about you, whether it is your home ISP or the University or Work account where the IP address is registered. Your IP address could potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you.

If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.

If so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing service. Please see http://tor.eff.org/ for more details.

## Cookies

Our sites may use cookies. This is often as a convenience for you to enable certain site features.

You may wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you wish to refrain from revealing any identifying information, especially if you are using a public or shared computer. You may also wish to disable your browser from accepting cookies.

## Private logging

Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send quite a bit of information to the server. The webservers that host this site maintain access logs with the information that you send. This information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here. We do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.

The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.

We also use web analytics services to get a general idea of the kinds of traffic our websites get in order to provide better services and to set benchmarks for how we are doing in meeting the OKFN’s goals.

Again, if you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.

## Data release policy

Our policy is only to release the data we collect in the following circumstances:

  * As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.
  * To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
  * When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.
  * For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’s Internet Service Provider.
  * If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.
  * When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.



## No selling of information

We will not sell information collected via this site, such as your email address, to third parties.

## Information security

We make no guarantee that the information that you provide us will be secure.
