# Privacy Policy | Okada Manila

Okada Manila* values your interest, patronage, and privacy. We have, therefore, implemented policies that govern the Personal Data (as defined under the Data Privacy Act of 2012) collection, use, storage, and security practices of the Okada Manila website, as detailed below. This Privacy Notice summarizes our Company’s policies and practices that comply with Philippines Laws, and applies to all websites owned or directly operated by Okada Manila.

The Philippines may exercise privacy protection that varies with other countries. In jurisdictions outside of the Philippines where laws governing privacy differ, we endeavor to adjust our policies and practices to achieve the best practices in data privacy security and protection. Otherwise, we make no representations that our privacy policies and practices are compliant with the requirements of foreign jurisdictions.

This Privacy Notice and our data privacy policies applies to all Personal Data in whatever form (e.g., physical or digital), and processing of Personal Data in whatever manner (e.g., manual or automated) by Okada Manila. By using Okada Manila’s services and/or signing up/registering with us, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Notice, and you are consenting to Okada Manila’s collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Notice.

If you do not wish to provide your Personal Data to us, Okada Manila may not be able to provide you with products and services you request, or to tell you about the products and services we offer.

In order to better anticipate your needs, and to provide you with better service, we collect information from you in a variety of ways such as:

We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, as required under applicable legal obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.
