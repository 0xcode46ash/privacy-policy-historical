It is then not decrypted until it reaches our server. The locked padlock symbol in the bottom left hand corner of your browser tells you our site is secure. When this is displayed it means that you can safely send private information through our site. Our secure pages will not display a 'security alert' message. This means that our pages are secure and that your information is safe with us. Also, we protect our internal information from the Internet by using a Firewall (security software) on our server.
