# Privacy & Cookie Policy - McDonald's ourlounge

  


**McDonald's Restaurants Ltd ourlounge Privacy Policy**

McDonald's Restaurants Limited, referred to in this policy as "we", "us" or "our", are pleased to provide information to all of our employees and alumni about our online privacy policy. Please be assured that we use our best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this web site.

**Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used**

We only collect and use personal information, such as first and last names, addresses and email addresses from you. In addition, we may also gather date of birth and mobile phone details where you voluntarily provide this information to us.

**Sharing of Personal Information**

We may share personal information within the McDonald's Family; by this expression, we mean McDonald's Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, together with their respective franchisees and certain selected companies.

Those selected companies are either our partners who perform a function such as prize-provision within our promotions and offers, or are agencies and suppliers whom we have retained to assist us to more effectively fulfill orders, manage and conduct promotions and offers, provide technical assistance and support and perform other functions to support our marketing activities.

All selected companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions, but will only be permitted by us to use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function (which may include one to which you have expressly given your consent) and not for any other purpose.

We will only transfer personal information about you outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the extent that it is permitted under all privacy and communications legislation applicable within the UK.   By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of your information outside of the EEA.

In all cases, any use of your personal information by the McDonald's Family which use has been instigated by us (as opposed, for example, to a promotional partner), will comply with this policy.

Occasionally, with your permission and depending on the purpose for and context in which you gave that permission, we will send marketing information and news to you, for example, relating to new product offerings, loyalty schemes and clubs, discount coupons and other promotions and offers. This may include our sending to you marketing information for the products or services of a promotional partner on that partner's behalf.

However, in every case, if you do not elect to receive such communications or if you elect to discontinue receiving them, then we will not send or will cease sending them to you. Also, we reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement or regulatory investigation. Save for this, we do not sell, transfer or disclose personal information we have collected from you in connection with our web site activities, to third parties outside the McDonald's Family.

Please note that if we are, in turn, a promotional partner of an unrelated company, for example where we are not asking you to submit any personal information to us but are simply providing information on our site and there may be a link to the other company's web site where one must visit to take part in that company's promotion, offer or other activity, then the privacy policy of that other company will apply instead of ours.

Whilst we make every effort to only tie-in with reputable companies which have a similar high regard for your privacy, you should make sure you are aware of what their policies say, as we are not responsible for the policies and practices of other companies, including those of other members of the McDonald's Family.

**Access**

You are in control of any personal information you provide to us on-line. If at any time, you would like to correct the personal information we have about you or if you would like to change your preferences for contacts from us or other members of the McDonald's Family, you can change your personal information by clicking on your name once you have logged in.

**Cookies**

ourlounge uses cookies to give you the best online experience.  If you would like to know more or change your settings, please read our Cookie Policy below which explains in more detail how cookies are used.

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

From time to time, it may be necessary for us to change this privacy policy, so we suggest that you check here periodically. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retrospectively applied and will not alter how we handle previously collected information.

This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to you when you visit the ourlounge site owned and operated by  McDonald's Restaurants Limited (referred to in this policy as "we", "us" or "our") and how you can block and/or delete cookies.

**What are cookies and how do they work?**

"Cookies" are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Like most websites, we use different categories of cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience.

Depending on the purpose, we use session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

**What are the categories of cookies?**

Cookies can be categorised, following the International Chamber of Commerce guide, as follows:

**1) Strictly necessary cookies**

'Strictly necessary cookies’ let you move around the website and enable you to use features that you have specifically asked for, such as the Nutrition Calculator. Without these cookies these features would not function.

Strictly necessary cookies tend to be session cookies which are deleted at the end of the browser session.

Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the website, so if you prevent these cookies we can't guarantee how our website will perform during your visit.

**2) Performance Cookies**

'Performance cookies’ collect information about how you use our website such as which pages you visit and if you experience any errors. These cookies don't collect any information that could identify you – all the information is collected on an anonymous aggregate basis and is only used to help us improve how our website works, understand what interests our users and measure the effectiveness of our advertising. They also enable us to track the total number of visitors to our site. Most performance cookies tend to be session cookies which are deleted at the end of the browser session.

In some cases, some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties, but we don't allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above. Some of these third party performance cookies are not session based and have varying expiry dates.

We use a Double Click advertising tracking cookie to record visits to specific pages on our site. This cookie indicates which advert prompted your visit. Clicking on the following link will prevent you from receiving this cookie:

<http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/html/opt-out.html>

If you prevent performance cookies we cannot use information from your visit to improve your future website.

**3) Functionality Cookies**

'Functionality cookies’ are used to provide services or to remember your settings. This may include your user name if you have selected ‘remember me’ at a log in page. These cookies help to customise your McDonald's web experience. They also assist with the administration of certain other activities such as online prize promotions. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.

Functionality cookies, by their very nature, are persistent cookies so that we remember your computer when you return to our website.

Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties – where this is the case we don't allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.

If you prevent cookies, including functionality cookies, this may mean we can't offer you some services.  
**  
4) Targeting Cookies**

Targeting cookies collect the most information about users. These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.  
We shall not use a targeting cookie without your express consent, which we would usually obtain by asking you to register and/or opt in to a particular service.

**How can I block and/or delete cookies?**

Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.

To delete cookies on Internet Explorer 8, follow these steps:

Click to open Internet Explorer.  
Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.  
On the General tab, under Browsing history, click Delete.  
Select the Cookies check box, and then click Delete if it isn't already checked. Clear or select check boxes for any other options you also want to delete.

If you don't change any check boxes, deleting the browsing history removes temporary Internet files, webpage history, and cookies. Temporary files and cookies for your saved favourite websites are preserved.

If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select "cookies" in the "Help" function of your browser for information on where to find your cookie folder.

If you disable all cookies you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this website and some webpages make not work correctly.

**Does this policy change?**

This Policy was last updated in May 2012. From time to time, it may be necessary for us to change this cookie policy. This might be for a number of reasons; for example, it is not currently our policy to enable purchases of merchandise online via any of our websites, but if this policy were to change we would wish to use cookies to keep track of your online purchases, to keep your purchases secure and to assist you with making them. So, we suggest that you check here periodically for any changes.

**Feedback**  
If you have any questions or feedback on our Cookie Policy, please contact us at customerfeedback@mcdonalds.co.uk.
