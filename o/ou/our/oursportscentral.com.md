 **Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy OurSports Central provides this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the OurSports Central website. At this time, we collect no personal or demographic information from our visitors. Should we request such information in the future, the intended use of it will be clearly marked.

 **The Way We Use Information:**

We do not use or share any personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to those described when requesting the information, without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to specifically attract anyone under 13. 

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

Because we do not collect any personal information, there is nothing that will need to be corrected.

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please [contact us](http://www.oursportscentral.com/about/contact).
