## Safeguarding your rights

OUT-LAW.COM is part of international law firm [Pinsent Masons](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/). The privacy of our users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use your personal information and elaborates on our Data Protection notice (which is displayed at the point of user registration).

## What information do we collect?

When you register as a user, we will collect the information necessary to provide the service which includes, as a minimum, your name and an e-mail address. You will also be asked to provide your organisation name and address, but you can register without providing these details. Once you are registered, you can revisit [your profile](http://www.out-law.com/page-515) at any time to amend these details or to provide additional details.

We will also collect information from you if you complete any other forms on our site or if you contact us with comments or specific requests.

## What do we use personal information for?

We want to provide a service which is personalised to each of our visitors. We also want to give you control of what you receive as a result of registering with OUT-LAW.COM.

## OUT-LAW Weekly Round-up

If you decide you would like to receive our OUT-LAW News weekly round-up, you will receive this e-mail once per week only. Sometimes this will be sponsored by a third party, so its details may also appear on the email. However, your details will never be given to any such party without your consent.

## OUT-LAW Magazine

Those in the UK who ask to receive OUT-LAW Magazine will get this sent to them by post – so a postal address must be provided. It is sent as an electronic copy to overseas subscribers.

## Contacting you for other purposes

We will contact you about other Pinsent Masons' events and services from time to time by email, telephone, fax or other electronic messaging service – but only if you choose to provide these contact details **and** request that we contact you about events and services by ticking the relevant box in your profile. We may contact you occasionally about our surveys, special offers or competitions; but **we will never bombard you with rubbish**.

Another box lets Pinsent Masons' business partners also contact you. You don't have to tick this box. If you do, please be aware that any such third parties will be carefully selected: we will always be cautious about letting anyone else contact you – so ticking this box does not mean that we would sell your email address to spammers.

This information is used to make your visit to our site more efficient, and to help us follow browsing preferences on our site so that we can make regular improvements.
