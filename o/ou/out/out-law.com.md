## Safeguarding your rights

OUT-LAW.COM is part of international law firm [Pinsent Masons](http://www.pinsentmasons.com/). The privacy of our users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use your personal information and elaborates on our Data Protection notice (which is displayed at the point of user registration).

## What information do we collect?

When you register as a user of our site, to attend our events or receive emails from us, we will collect the information necessary to provide these services to you.  As a minimum, we will require your name and e-mail address. You may also be asked to provide your organisation name, but unless you are registering for one of our events, you don't need to provide this information if you don't want to. If you are registered with us, you can revisit [your profile](https://web.archive.org/en/newsletter) at any time to amend these details or to provide additional details.

We will also collect information from you if you complete any other forms on our site or if you contact us with comments or specific requests.

## What do we use personal information for?

We want to provide a service which is personalised to each of our visitors. We also want to give you control of what you receive as a result of registering with OUT-LAW.COM.

## OUT-LAW Weekly Round-up

If you decide you would like to receive our OUT-LAW News weekly round-up, you will receive this e-mail once per week only. Sometimes this will be sponsored by a third party, so its details may also appear on the email. However, your details will never be given to any such party without your consent.

## Your comments on our site

It is possible to add comments to some pages of OUT-LAW. In doing so, your IP (internet protocol) address and any other information that you choose to provide (e.g. your email address) will be transferred to [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/), a US-based company.

This information is not made available to users of OUT-LAW.COM but it will be transferred to Pinsent Masons. We will store this data for six months and then delete it.

We will not use this information for marketing and we will only disclose this information to third parties for the purpose of or in connection with any legal proceedings (including prospective legal proceedings) or as otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal rights or to the extent that we are required to do so by law. Its retention by Disqus is subject to Disqus’s own policies.

Comments on OUT-LAW.COM are governed by our comments policy.

## Contacting you for other purposes

We will contact you about other Pinsent Masons' events and services from time to time by email, telephone, fax or other electronic messaging service – but only if you choose to provide these contact details **and** request that we contact you about events and services by ticking the relevant box in your profile or ticking the relevant box on the seminar booking form. We may contact you occasionally about our surveys, special offers or competitions; but **we will never bombard you with rubbish**.

Another box lets Pinsent Masons' business partners also contact you. You don't have to tick this box. If you do, please be aware that any such third parties will be carefully selected: we will always be cautious about letting anyone else contact you – so ticking this box does not mean that we would sell your email address to spammers.

We automatically collect information about your visit to our site. This information is used to make your visit to our site more efficient, and to help us follow browsing preferences on our site so that we can make regular improvements.

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files that can be used by web sites to make a user's experience more efficient. This site uses different types of cookie.

We use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. **Google Analytics uses cookies** to help us to analyse how users use the site.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use OUT-LAW.COM's audio or video players, Google Analytics will try to store some additional data on your computer. This data is known as a Local Shared Object or  **Flash cookie**. This helps us to analyse the popularity of our media files. We can count the total number of times each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through. Adobe's website offers tools to [control Flash cookies on your computer](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html "Opens in a new window").

Please also note that when you register with OUT-LAW.COM, we offer you a **cookie to save your login details**. This means you will not need to use your username and password to access our content when using the computer on which the cookie is stored. However, you will still need to use your username and password to access your profile. The cookie file itself does not store your personal information.

If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. You can access them through some types of browser. Search in your cookie folders for 'out-law' to find our cookie and the Google Analytics cookie if you wish to delete them.

More information about cookies, including how to block them or delete them, can be found at [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
