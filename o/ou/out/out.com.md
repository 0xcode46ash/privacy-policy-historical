**PLANETOUT PRIVACY STATEMENT**

PlanetOut has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all PlanetOut-managed sites, including PlanetOut on the World Wide Web and PlanetOut on America Online. PlanetOut feels very strongly that private information should remain private. We will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user’s permission.  We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please email us by [ clicking here ](https://web.archive.org/action/) . We'll be refining this policy over the next several weeks, so your feedback is important. We've also asked [ TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) , an independent, non-profit privacy initiative dedicated to building users' trust and confidence on the Internet, to certify out privacy statement. 

**PLANETOUT GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:** ****

**IP Address  
** PlanetOut’s web servers and our feedback form on the web gather your IP address to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site, and to gather broad demographic information. Demographic information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user. 

****

**Cookies  
** Our website sets cookies to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password and member name so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit. A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell us to do so; your password is stored on your computer and transferred over the internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your web browser can access PlanetOut as you if you choose to store your member name and password. PlanetOut’s web servers also set a session ID cookie that is used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Session IDs cannot be traced to an individual person or member name, and are analyzed only in aggregate. Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them; be aware, however, that doing so may prevent certain parts of PlanetOut’s site from working (e.g., web chat). Other organizations which place advertising on PlanetOut sometimes have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we don’t not control. Unless you’ve saved your member name, cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (your computer will be assigned a random number); neither PlanetOut nor advertisers will know who you are..

**Registration Form  
** Membership on PlanetOut is completely optional.. PlanetOut’s registration form requires users to give contact information (for example, an email address) and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age). We use this information to send members information about PlanetOut (e.g., a weekly newsletter); members may opt-out of receiving this information. This information may be used to tailor a member’s PlanetOut experience by delivering content specific to your interests. At times, PlanetOut may rent names, mailing and email addresses to carefully selected organizations. This information is rented on a single-use-only basis. Members may opt-out of these programs by selecting "don’t share my mailing address" and/or "don’t share my email address" on our registration form. Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process is shared with advertisers and other partners. This aggregate information is not traceable to an individual user.
