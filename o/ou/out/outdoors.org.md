# AMC: About the AMC - Privacy Policy

**Information Collected During Website Usage**  
The Appalachian Mountain Club is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most portions of our website, www.outdoors.org, without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from all visits is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the Website that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. This is standard logging information collected on all websites. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.

 **Collection of personal information  
** The AMC may collect email addresses and other personal data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to www.outdoors.org. For example, our site uses forms that ask for personal information if you purchase merchandise online, apply for a seasonal job, make a donation, register for a program, or become a member.

Some of the activist functions of our site, such as the Conservation Action Network, also require registration of personal information. We use this information to make these functions more effective and provide participants with additional information about conservation issues.

The AMC makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies. For example, when entering personal address, phone number, and credit card information, we use Secure Socket Layer encryption to ensure unauthorized individuals cannot intercept and read this data over a network connection. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

 **Email Privacy Policy  
** The AMC does not sell or exchange email addresses. In some instances, we use third-party companies to help us provide products and services to you, like a service that sends out our emails and e-newsletters or an order fulfillment house. In those instances we need to share your email address with them. We require that those companies use the information only to deliver the specific product or service they are contracted to provide. It is our intention to send only email communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive. When you join the AMC, renew your membership, make a reservation, take action through the Conservation Action Network, or register for a program and provide your email address, we may contact you via email and provide information about conservation issues, activities and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you are a member of one of our e-newsletters, we may invite you to join other AMC e-newsletters.

In some cases, we use a third-party email service provider to send emails. The service provider is prohibited from using your email address for any purpose other than to send AMC-related email. Every time you receive an email newsletter, you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future emails by following the instructions provided in the email.

 **Disclosure of Other Personal Information to Third Parties  
** When you become a member of the AMC, we do not share your phone number with other organizations. Some information on our membership lists, such as your name and physical street address, may be rented or exchanged on a reciprocal basis with other organizations. This policy applies whether you apply for membership through our website or through other means. Members may opt-out of such membership list exchanges and direct mail from AMC by contacting our membership department [link]. We use third-party companies to help us provide products and services to you. In those instances we need to share your personal information with them. We require that those companies use the information only to deliver the specific product or service they are contracted to provide.

We may release personal information if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.

 **Cookies**  
Some areas of our site, including our bulletin board system and AMC Store, use "cookies." Cookies are used to save information so it does not need to be re-entered on each visit or on each page. The Store cookies keep track of user ID, last visits and items in the shopping cart. The BBS cookies keep track of last visits and last posts. No sensitive personal information is stored in cookies.

 **Questions**  
Any questions on this privacy policy may be sent to: [webeditor@outdoors.org](mailto:webeditor@outdoors.org).
