# Outsports: The Home For Gay Sports Fans and Athletes

**Outsports is a strong believer in privacy. Here is how we handle information obtained by registering on our site:**

**Information Collection and Use**  

Outsports.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

**Registration**  
In order to post to our discussion board, or be registered in our clubhouse, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to supply a user name (or "handle'') and their e-mail address. All other fields are optional, but encouraged so people know a little more about you (such as location, favorite sports, teams etc.)

**Cookies**  
The Discussion Board uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Board. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Board. The only drawback to this is that the user will have to log in each time they want to use the board. It's your choice.

**Sharing**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

Members will occasionally receive information on Outsports products, services, special deals, and a newsletter; or from Outsports partners. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. **[E-mail us](mailto:mail@outsports.com)** to get off our mailing list.

**Links**  
The Discussion Board may contain links to other sites posted by users. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Security**  
Outsports takes every precaution to protect our users' information. Only Outsports staff have access to this personal information.

**Third-party advertisers**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [ click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an **[e-mail.](mailto:mail@outsports.com)**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home Page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
