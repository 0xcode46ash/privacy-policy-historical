**Outside Online's Privacy Pledge

At Outside Online, we are concerned about your privacy. Keeping the privacy of our audience and earning and retaining the trust of our customers is good business for us. Thus, we have written this pledge to inform you about our privacy practices. 

We want to provide you with articles, information, travel opportunities, books, gear and anything else that helps you get outside. To do this, we sometimes ask you to provide personal information to us. Our philosophy is that you should have control over what kind of information you provide to us and how we use this information. 

Please take the time to review our privacy pledge and understand what we do and don't do with data that we collect from you. 

Before getting into the details, we want to let you know what you've probably already noticed if you've spent anytime on our Travel channel. We've teamed up with Away.com to expand our online offering. Away.com is the leading provider of adventure travel information and trip booking resources. Outside Online is now part of the Away Network which also includes Away.com, Historictraveler.com, and AdventurousTraveler.com. All information that you submit to Outside Online is collected by Away.com Inc. and Mariah Media Inc., the publisher of Outside magazine. 

Personal and Demographic Data Collected by Outside Online 

**

**Outside Online** may ask for your name, email address, regular address, zip code, and country when you sign up for contests, Outside Online email newsletters, and other products. During or after registration, we may ask for other personal interests (including favorite activity and destination), address, birth date, occupation, and income range. From time to time, we may present you with offers for additional products from Outside Online or subscription or other offers from _Outside_ magazine. If you do not want us to send you these offers, please send an email to privacy@outsidemag.com. 

We may also ask whether you are willing to receive special offers from partners. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of the release of information. See the section on "Sharing of Data with Partners and Other Third Parties" for further detail. 

**Personal and Demographic Data Collected by Away.com**

If you express interest in booking a trip through **Away.com** by either calling the telephone number on our site or by filling out a form on our site, Away.com will ask when you plan to travel, where you want to travel, what you want to do while traveling, how many people you want to travel with, where your trip will originate, and whether you require airfare. Away.com will also ask for a daytime phone number in case you want to be called by one of Away.com's travel specialists. 

Away.com uses this information to provide you with personalized travel services and to direct you to offers from us or selected partners that would appeal to you. You can still use the Outside Online site without providing personal information, but you may not be able to take advantage of any personalized services we may offer. 

If you purchase a product or service from Away.com, you will be asked to provide an address, phone number, and a credit card number. Unless collected elsewhere, Away.com collects this information only to complete the purchase transaction. This does not apply to purchases made on sites linked to by Outside Online (see below). 

**Sharing Of Data With Partners And Other Third Parties**

**Outside Online** may provide personal information to selected partners who we believe have offerings that would be valuable to you. If you do not want this information disclosed, please send an email to privacy@outsidemag.com. 

If you registered with Outside Online prior to August 1, 2001, we will assume that you have opted-out of receiving information from Outside Online's selected partners, unless they are offered in a message sent by Outside Online (for example, in an Outside Online newsletter which you have opted to receive). 

If you are currently receiving the AdventurousTraveler.com catalog and do not wish your mailing address shared with partners, please call AdventurousTraveler.com directly at 1-800-282-3963 to withhold your information from our partners. 

Outside Online links you to a Trip Finder service and a call center provided by Away.com that enables you to book trips run by tour operators not affiliated with Outside Online or Away.com. When you book your travel tour through Away.com, they share the information you have provided with the tour supplier and any other involved third party to ensure successful fulfillment of your travel plans. Outside Online and Away.com are not responsible for tour operators' use of any information provided to them. 

Outside Online will disclose personal information when required to by law enforcement or other appropriate governmental authorities, or if the personal information is pertinent in a legal proceeding or court action. 

Outside Online will provide aggregate, anonymous information (e.g. "55% of our members enjoy hiking") to advertisers and third parties. Such aggregate data cannot be linked to any one person. 

**Merchandise/Co-branded Sites**

**Outside Online** offers books, maps, and other products at the **Outside Bookstore**. This bookstore is run by our partner AdventurousTraveler.com. Purchases at this bookstore are made directly with AdventurousTraveler.com. AdventurousTraveler.com has its own [privacy policy](http://www.adventuroustraveler.com/PrivacyPol.asp) in regards to purchase transactions made on its store on Outside Online or directly on its site. 

**Outside Online** may also link to the websites of other companies to allow you to purchase merchandise. These sites may look similar to Outside Online, but are run by separate companies with whom we have partnered. You can tell if you are at a partner site if "outside.com" no longer appears in your browser address bar, if the word "frames" appears in the address bar (and the left-hand navigation menu no longer appears), or if the words "Powered by" or "Brought to you by" the name of partner appear anywhere on the page (including the bottom). 

Outside Online may receive a commission for any purchases you make on partner sites. To help calculate these commissions, Outside Online sends a tracking number to the partners. We do not provide personal information to our merchandise partners. Our partners will let us know what you purchased on their sites. 

Each partner site has its own privacy policy on gathering information from you. You may wish to check this policy before giving out personal information. Outside Online does not control how a partner uses information gathered on its site. 

As noted above, Outside Online contains links to AdventurousTraveler.com, a partner of Outside Online, to let you purchase books, maps, and other merchandise. You can reach the privacy policy of AdventurousTraveler.com [here](http://www.adventuroustraveler.com/PrivacyPol.asp).

**Cookies and I.P. Addresses**

As part of offering you a valuable service, Outside Online uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie is set when you browse our site. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but your user experience at Outside Online will be significantly limited if you do so.

All people who browse our site receive cookies for the purpose of tracking the number of people who visit any one page. Unless you register, we cannot identify you other than through the tracking number stored in the cookie. 

Outside Online also collects IP addresses of those browsing our sites as a complementary way of tracking site usage. We do not track any individual person's activities using IP addresses. Instead, we use this information solely to determine the number of times browsers view a page of our site. 

**Advertising Services**

**Outside Online** uses RealMedia, an advertising network, to provide ads to our site. Outside Online does **not** provide any personal information about our members or people using our site to RealMedia. Viewing ads will cause a cookie to be set in your browser.

**Children**

Outside Online is not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may use Outside Online only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Business Transfers**

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy web sites or other assets. In such transactions, customer information is usually one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Mariah Media or Away.com or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information collected on Outside Online may be on of the transferred assets. 

**Email**

**Outside Online** will not continue to send you any regular email if you do not wish to receive any. Click here to deselect any of our newsletters to which you are subscribed.

1\. We can calculate how many people were interested in the topic of an email or in a particular link of an email;   
2\. Provide personalized services that are best suited to your interests 

If you do not wish this information to be collected about you, you should unsubscribe from our emails. 

**Public Forums**

**Outside Online** makes message boards available to its audience. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**

**Outside Online** keeps all personal information in a secure server that is only accessible to designated Outside Online employees. 

If you register at our partner site, Away.com, Away.com asks you to provide a password when you register on their site. You then have the option of storing that password on a cookie set on your computer. This way, you need not type in the password when you again access the Away site. 

If the computer you are using is not for your sole use, you should click the "sign off" button located at the top of every page when you have finished accessing the site. This action prevents other people from accessing your information. When you want to access member-only areas of Away.com at another time, you will need to sign in and type in your password. You will have the option of having your password e-mailed to you if you have forgotten what it is. 

**Supplementing Information**

**Outside Online** supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. We do not further share this information with others. 

**Changes in Privacy Pledge**

As the nature of our business changes, Outside Online may need to change its privacy pledge. If the pledge is changed, this page will be updated. You will not be provided with any other notice of a change in the privacy pledge. Please check this page to see if there have been any changes.
