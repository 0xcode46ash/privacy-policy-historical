# Monadnock Research Portal Privacy Policy

Monadnock Research Portal Privacy Policy 

We are strongly committed to safeguarding subscriber privacy. 

The Monadnock Research Portal operates under the following privacy guidelines: 

The information we obtain from subscribers on this site is required to process credit card charges for subscription fees, and to manage member relations and provide services to clients. This information is never revealed, sold, or made public for any reason.

Client information, including the fact that someone is or has been a subscriber, is strictly confidential. We never disclose subscription status, or even the number of subscribers at a company or in total, to any third-party.

 **Cookies**  
Each time a subscriber logs into this site, we store a temporary 'cookie' in the browser files of that subscriber's system. This cookie is used during the online session to allow access to the Client Area, without repeatedly requiring members to re-enter login credentials.

When you log off or leave the site, the "cookie" is automatically removed.

 **External Links**  
In order to provide visitors with greater value, some of our pages provide links to third-party websites. No subscriber information or 'cookies' are provided to those third party sites.

Many sites attempt to capture visitor information when you browse those sites. Once you leave MonadnockResearch.net, we are not able to alert you to attempts by others to gather browser information. These sites may use information in a manner that is inconsistent with our stated privacy policies.

 **Private Forums**  
We provide community members with Discussion Forums on this site and elsewhere that make sharing information with other subscribers easy. To protect your privacy when posting or replying to messages on this site, your personal information and email is not revealed unless you choose to do so. You may find that questions posed anonymously may receive fewer responses. But members are never required to disclose any more information than they feel comfortable disclosing. Any information disclosed in discussion forums here or elsewhere on MR partner sites can be read by all other subscribers, or group members on the Consulting Services Sourcing and Procurement Insights group on LinkedIn. 

**Security**  
We use a variety of security measures including encryption and authentication to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information under our control. 

**Choice/Opt-In**  
Our site gives users the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us. You can be assured that we never reveal, sell, or make available your email address to anyone for any purpose. We also give members the option to opt-out of communications, and opt-out instructions are included in every communication. 

**Other**
