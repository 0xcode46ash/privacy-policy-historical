# Privacy Policy

Outright is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of personal information collected from our users. Below is our privacy policy, which outlines what information we collect, how it is used, how it is stored and protected, and how you can control use of your data.

## Information we collect about you

### Registration information

When signing up for an account with Outright, we ask for your email address and for you to create a password. These two pieces of information are used to identify you on the site and provide access to your account.

### Company/Business information

In order to take advantage of all of the features within Outright, you may choose to enter additional information about your company or business, including name and contact information.

### Anonymous usage information

Through the use of cookies, we track page-level usage of Outright across all users. All of this information is in summary form and not tied to an individual person. For example, we might track the number of returning customers who visited the reports page last week. But we would not know if it were you personally who visited the that page.

## How your information is used

The predominant way in which your information is used is to provide a tailored customer experience not only on the web site, but through other communication options (such as receiving an email reminder for estimated tax deadlines.)

We may also communicate to you via email address regarding updates the to web site/service.

We will not share or share your personal Account Information for commercial purposes. However, we may aggregate, in an anonymous manner, financial transaction data derived from Account Information and disclose such data in the following ways, none of which can be identified with you individually:

  * To other Outright users, who wish to compare business finances relative to the broader community of Outright users.
  * To members of the press and market research organizations, approved by Outright, who desire to understand more about how entrepreneurs run their businesses.



We may use or disclose your information in response to a subpoena or court order, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

If we deem it necessary, we will also use or share your information in order to investigate or prevent illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or the security of our service, violations of our terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.

## How your data is stored

Outright uses third party vendors and hosting providers to supply the necessary hardware, software, communication and related technology required to run Outright. Although Outright owns all of the code, databases and rights to the Outright application, you retain all rights to your data.

All of your personally identifiable information is stored in a database on one or more servers. While your contact information is stored normally, in plain text, your password is encrypted in a way that even employees of Outright cannot access it. This prevents others from being able to access your account.

## Control of your data

You may make changes to your personal data at any time. You may also choose to cancel your account and delete your data at any time.

## Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or postings of an annual or revised Privacy Policy on the Outright web site, and that such electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the Privacy Policy.
