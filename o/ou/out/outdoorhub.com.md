## OUTSIDE HUB PRIVACY POLICY

Outside Hub, LLC. ("OHUB") is the operator of the Outside Hub, www.outsidehub.com, and a variety of related websites and activities. As part of its business, OHUB gathers personally identifiable information on its websites as well as anonymous data regarding the website and your activities on the site. OHUB takes its privacy obligations very seriously. 

This policy outlines the treatment of information OHUB collects online. 

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information:  
Whenever OHUB collects personally identifiable about you it reserves the right to use that information for marketing the OHUB and its various activities. This is true in both the unpaid and paid sections of the OHUB site. OHUB shall use the personally identifiable data collected to undertake a variety of marketing activities including, but not limited to, email, direct mail, site personalization, telephone marketing and other digital and traditional methods of advertising and communication. OHUB does not sell or "monetize" data to 3rd parties. OHUB, however, does and will send marketing messages on behalf of its sponsors and partners. It will do so without giving any of your personally identifiable information to those sponsors and partners for their own use. 

If you want to "opt-out" of receiving marketing messages from OHUB or you wish to correct the information you have provided to OHUB, you may do so by: 

Sending an email to [info@outsidehub.com](mailto:info@outsidehub.com). In the Subject Line of the email, you must write "Opt-out" and your full name. In the body of the email, you must write "Opt-Out" along with your full name and email address. 

From time to time, OHUB will allow its Sponsors or marketing partners to offer OHUB site visitors an opportunity to "opt-in" to receive marketing information directly from that Sponsor or marketing partner. In such cases, on the registration page, an "opt-in" question will appear clearly explaining that by checking the box you agree to share your personally identifiable information with that particular Sponsor or marketing partner. If there is not a Sponsor "opt-in" question on a registration form, OHUB will not give any of the data collected to any Sponsor or partner. 

If you want to "opt-out" of receiving marketing messages from a OHUB Sponsor or Marketing Partner after you have "opted-in" to receive such messages, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to OHUB, you may do so by: 

Sending an email to info@outsidehub.com. In the Subject Line of the email, you must write "Opt-out" and the name of the Sponsor or marketing Partner from which you wish to "Opt-out". In the body of the email, you must write "Opt-Out" along with your full name and email address. OHUB does use cookies on its site to learn about the activities of its site users. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use OHUB products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many OHUB products and services do not require that you accept cookies. 

OHUB uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content, Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using OHUB's site, display the most appropriate advertising banners and content, based on your interests and activity on OHUB, estimate and report our total audience size and traffic, conduct research to improve OHUB's content and services, require you to re-enter your OHUB password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents. 

In addition to OHUB cookies, we allow certain of our Sponsors and Marketing Partners to set and access their cookies on your computer. Those companies provide auditing, research and reporting for marketing and advertising purposes. Advertisers' and researchers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the OHUB Privacy Policy. 

Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:  
OHUB's site technology has the ability to collect data other than personally identifiable information. OHUB may collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. OHUB may collect information about the site you last visited prior to OHUB or about your activity during your visit to a OHUB site. This information will not reveal your personal identity (it is anonymous), may be used by OHUB to administer the technical and operational aspects of this site, and may include identifying and using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

Material Changes to Policy:  
OHUB may make material changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you should periodically visit this page to view the current Privacy Policy. In the event of a material change to this Privacy Policy, OHUB shall send an email advising of the change to all whose email addresses we have collected and retained pursuant to the terms set forth above.
