# Privacy Statement of Oh-Barcelona.com (Open House Spain S.L.)

  * ## **Information collection**

  


Open House Spain SL obtains users information at different points throughout our website. This personal data will be stored within a file held by Open House Spain SL. The user is expected to provide true, exact, complete and current information. 

**Forms**

We request personal information on our accommodation booking form and owner’ registration form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email address, passport number and address) and in some cases financial information (such as credit card number, expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the user’s requests. If we have problems processing a booking, we use the information to contact the user.

Personal information such as name, email address, passport number, age, gender and contact details are shared with the owner of the apartment. We encourage you to contact the owner regarding the use of your personal information. The information we collect is used only for booking purposes, to notify you of your reservation status and to ask for feedback about your stay and is not shared with any third party which is not directly involved in the booking process. All credit card processing is done by Open House Spain SL.

## **Use of information**

  


**Reservations**

Users’ personal information is used only to carry out the services offered on our website. 

**Profile**

We store information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we obtain through the preferences selected by site users. Consequently, collected information is not tied to the users’ personally identifiable information. We do not share our customer profile with other third parties. 

**Third-party advertising**

No other third parties advertise on our website.

**Log files**

Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc., are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Transfer of data**

Information supplied is managed by our server located in Spain, under the protection of the Organic Law 15/1999, of 13 December, regarding the Protection of Data of a Personal Nature (LOPD). The user specifically consents to the transfer of his information to fulfil this purpose.

  *   


## **Opt-in/Opt-out**

We send an evaluation/follow-up email to clients who have booked an apartment after they have left their accommodation. Any user who does not wish to receive a follow-up email should contact us by email on the day of departure from their accommodation at info@gowithoh.com.

**Registered users and clients**

When users make a reservation or register to create an account, we set up a profile page for them. Any content and information in this area will be kept strictly private and in no case given to a third party. The user's account profile will include their first name, last name, address and other personal information necessary to make a reservation. Furthermore, they will be able to select other items such as future destinations or preferences regarding accommodation. Users can review and revise their profile information at any time.

By doing so, Oh-Barcelona will have access to all personal data a Facebook user publishes on their profile.
