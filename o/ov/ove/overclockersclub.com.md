**Privacy Statement**

 **Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect in our forum and when you signup for a contest. Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the userâ€™s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. This type of cookie is used mostly in our forum. When you signin with your userid and password you can click the button that says "Remember me". The next time you visit the forum, you will automatically be logged in, thanks to cookies. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site, but would have to enter their password and login over and over. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site, like our forum. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. Advertisers can not personally contact you in anyway whatsoever. 

**Third Party Advertising**  
The ads appearing on this web site are delivered to users by our adserver and [NetShelter](http://www.netshelter.net/), our web advertising partner. Information about users' visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. For more information about [NetShelter Network](http://www.netshelter.net/privacy/), cookies, and how to "opt-out", please got to [NetShelter.net](http://www.netshelter.net/privacy/). This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by OverclockersClub.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, affiliates, or 3rd party sites. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Overclockersclub.com, nor I are responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). Contact information will NOT be sent to 3rd party's but only for us to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior choice. 

**Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line On our site we have programs implemented to protect your email address in our forums. The only way that your email will be publicly avaliable is if you choose to "show" your email address in our forums so other users can contact you. On the Internet there are "Spam Bots", which surf the Internet and collect every email address they find and place them in a database, then they send junk email to all of these users. We have taken it a step higher in security and have blocked spam bots from our site.

 **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Contact Information** If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please go to our [contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20030603192535id_/http%3A//www.overclockersclub.com/about.shtml).
