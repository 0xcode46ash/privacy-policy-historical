DISCLAIMER: This privacy policy was written by a lawyer. This makes it only partly readable for normal human beings. So … before you start sweating, we would like you to know we do not collect, sell or rent your personal information without your explicit permission. 

This privacy policy explains how Overwolf uses the data of its users. If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Overwolf Terms of Use, which is available at [Terms of Use](http://www.overwolf.com/Terms.aspx). 

Overwolf respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Overwolf’s policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you. 

##  Personal information 

To make your Overwolf experience more personal, you may choose to (but you don’t have to!) provide us some personal information (like your email address, for example). "Personal Information" is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. We collect Personal Information that you provide to us, such as when you register for Overwolf or other services via Overwolf, post information in a blog or forum, or contact us for any reason. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with Overwolf. 

If you choose to provide Personal Information (such as your name or email address) to us, we will not share this information with third parties or other Overwolf users without your explicit permission (Yes, you must approve this! If you don’t, we will not share this information), except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order (don’t break the law and you should be just fine). We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make Overwolf more useful and to customize Overwolf and personalize its content for you. 

##  Statistical information 

"Statistical Information" is anonymous information we collect in order to understand our users better, and to improve our products. (As an example, "Statistical Information" includes how many users use Overwolf’s browser comparing to the Facebook widget). By analyzing usage we may compile certain statistical information, such as anonymous information about how users use our service and which games they play. In addition, when you use Overwolf certain statistical information may be gathered about your usage of Overwolf and used for diagnostic purposes and improving Overwolf. This information may include, for example, your device's platform (e.g., Windows 7, Windows XP, etc.); and the version of Overwolf that you are using. In addition, Overwolf records certain information it automatically receives, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, language preference, referring site, pages viewed and the order of those pages. Statistical data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Aggregate statistical information is anonymous and will not be linked to any Personal Information for provision to third parties. We may share such anonymous statistical information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion. 

##  Communities 

If you use any blogs or forums on Overwolf, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, and such information will not be considered Personal Information by Overwolf. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information (including Personal Information) in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. 

##  Cookies 

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser by a Web site. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating Web site when this visitor returns. Overwolf uses cookies to help personalize your Overwolf experience. A "persistent" cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across site visits. Also, if you log in to Overwolf, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use Overwolf. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of Overwolf may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.   
The Google Analytics features you've implemented based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). Using the Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize [Google Display Network ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). You and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to your site. How you use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics. 

##  Online Links to Other Sites 

Overwolf and Overwolf members or users can link to other websites of third-parties that provide useful information/service, or who have agreed to offer goods and services to Overwolf members (For example YouTube, Twitter, Google etc.). Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that third-party’s provider’s privacy policy. Except as described above, Overwolf is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of Web sites to which we link. Links from our site to third-parties or other sites are provided for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of each web site before providing them with personal information. To sum up - we cannot be held responsible for any third-party Web sites and accessing their content will be subject to their own privacy policies, which again - we advise you to check. 

##  Use of Overwolf by Children 

Overwolf does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and you must be 18 years of age or older in order to establish an account for Overwolf. Parents are able to set up accounts for their children. In this way verifiable parental consent is required in order to register a child under the age of 13 to be enrolled in training through the Site, and any parent setting up an account for his or her hereby represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of such child, and has the authority to provide information and render consents on behalf of such child. In the event you become aware that an individual under the age of 13 has enrolled without parental permission, please advise us immediately.
