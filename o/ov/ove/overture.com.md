# Overture - Privacy Policy

## Overture Privacy Policy 

In general, Overture does not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying information except in very specific instances, such as, for example, when you enroll as an advertiser in the Services, as defined below. Whenever we collect such information, you will have a choice regarding whether to provide it, how it will be used, and to whom it will be disclosed. The instances in which Overture does collect and use information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy. 

This Policy, or certain terms of this Policy, may not apply to you if you have entered into business agreements with Overture by, for example, entering into a contract for services such as Overture's Product Submit service. If you have entered into a business agreement with Overture, check the terms of the agreement for details. The terms of such business agreements supercede the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

Overture provides fun, easy to use services, including Overture Search (located at [www.overture.com](https://web.archive.org/d/USm/home/)) (the "Services"). The Services may also be located on third party Web sites and/or applications. The Services are made available by Overture Services, Inc. and, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "Overture"). Overture values its users and their concerns about privacy. To this end, Overture engages in consistent information practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding those practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that effort. 

**What does this Privacy Policy cover?**  
This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Overture. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information. By using the Services and our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we outline in this Privacy Policy. 

Overture may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will include the new language changes here. Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Overture provides links to Web sites operated by third parties, and also provides search results and similar services to third parties for display on their own Web sites or applications. Overture is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. 

Also, please be aware that banner ads on Overture are provided by a third party, which may collect cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These cookies are typically used to track performance of the banner ads. Overture does not determine which information will be collected by that third party. Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Banner Ads. 

**Third Party Banner Ads.**  
We use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/naiprivacy) for information on third-party advertisements served to Overture Search. 

**What information does Overture collect and how is it used? Does Overture disclose information to third parties?**  
Overture may collect any or all of the following four types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) pixel tags or (d) contact information and other personally identifying information. Overture's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties. Please note that Overture may transfer any information in its possession in connection with a sale of assets of the company, a sale of the company or a merger.  


**(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.** Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Overture may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "fly fishing." Overture collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Overture's servers collect information about the site from which you entered to enable Overture to calculate and pay its affiliates, information about the most frequently searched terms to help our advertisers provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, Overture uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services. 

**(b) Cookies.** Like many sites, Overture collects information about online behavior using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning, as well as to streamline their experiences using the Services. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. 

Overture may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. To Overture, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. 

You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. Overture may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. 

**(c) Pixel Tags.** Overture shares web site usage information about visitors to our web site with reputable third-party advertising companies for the purpose of targeting and measuring the effectiveness of our Internet advertisements on this site and other sites. For this purpose, Overture and our third-party advertising companies note some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs and web beacons). 

The information collected by Overture and our third-party advertising companies through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. For more information about our third-party advertisers, including how to opt out of their targeting programs, please visit their web sites: [Omniture](http://www.omniture.com/) (207.net), [Doubleclick](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/) ([opt-out](http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm)), [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) and [Performics](http://www.performics.com/). 

Additionally, Overture works with Yahoo! to research advertising effectiveness of our web site. Yahoo! uses pixel tags to conduct this research on our behalf. The information collected through these pixel tags is used for advertising reporting and analysis and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Information recorded through the use of these web beacons is aggregated by Yahoo! and then shared with us. No personally identifiable information about you is shared by Yahoo! with Overture as a result of this research. You may choose to opt-out of Yahoo! using this information for this research. To do so, please visit the Yahoo! [ Privacy Policy](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html). 

**(d) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.** Overture can obtain access to Personally Identifying Information, such as your name, email address, phone number, address and other contact information only (1) when you become an advertiser with Overture, provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from Overture and provide your name or return contact information, or (2) in connection with special offers or contests (such as promotions and sweepstakes). In addition, if you become an advertiser with Overture we may also require other Personally Identifying Information such as your credit card or debit card information. 

Overture may share information with partners and companies who work on our behalf to provide certain services, including email processors and delivery, research and affiliate marketing vendors. These companies are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose or from sharing this information with other companies. 

Overture may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information is not stored or used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is provided to a third party only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. Finally, you may choose to provide contact information, other personally identifying information, and demographic information in order to participate in optional surveys or contests, which are run for promotional purposes. Overture uses such information to send you information about our products and to notify you if you win the contest. Finally, from time to time, but only with your permission, Overture may provide certain of its users' registration information to selected third parties who wish to participate in special promotions offered in conjunction with Overture. Users may opt-out of receiving such communications at any time by contacting Overture. 

**Is data stored by Overture secure?**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Overture has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Overture (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that Overture will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. 

**Does Overture collect personally identifying information from or about children?**  
Overture uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration. Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy. 

**How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?**  
To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to Overture, please send an email containing your request to [privacy@Overture.com](mailto:privacy@overture.com). You must provide your full name and the email from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the email on file with Overture. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the email.
