# Overcast

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an email address and a password.

We do not send promotional emails. Your email address is only used for:

  * Logging in.
  * Resetting your password if you forget it.
  * Responding to any feedback or support emails you send us.
  * Notifying you of important account-related matters, such as security or billing problems.



We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress so we can sync this information between the website and any devices where you use the app. We also collect aggregate statistics about podcasts and podcast episodes that people subscribe and listen to.

If you enable push notifications, we need to store the token your device gives us to send them. We only ever use push notifications to initiate background downloads and notify you of new podcast episodes. We never use push notifications for marketing.

If you connect a Twitter account:

  * Episodes that you specifically “recommend” may appear in Overcast to people who follow you on Twitter, identifying you as the recommender.
  * Any podcasts you add to Overcast may appear to people who follow you on Twitter. You will not be identified as the source, although people may be able to deduce which podcasts likely came from you.
  * To provide these recommendations, we store a Twitter login token to periodically look up your Twitter username, avatar, and list of people you follow. This is a read-only token that cannot post tweets or make any changes to your account, and no other information is read or stored.
  * At any time, you can revoke Overcast’s access to your Twitter account in our app, or in your account settings on Twitter’s website.



We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.

Like most websites and apps, we also store information through the use of software that may be transparent to users. For example, we may log your IP address and general information about your browser or device.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Overcast’s functionality.

We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.

For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS, and passwords are not stored: they are [hashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) using advanced, well-researched methods. (At the time of writing, [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) is used, but that may be upgraded to a more advanced algorithm in the future such as [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) without notice.)

## Accessing your information

You may access or change your information or delete your account at any time by logging into the app or website.

## Third-party links and content

Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [privacy@overcast.fm](mailto:privacy@overcast.fm).

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date below.
