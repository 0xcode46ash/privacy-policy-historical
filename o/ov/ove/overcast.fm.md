# Overcast

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## History of changes

  * **July 16, 2014:** First published.
  * **February 26, 2016:** Added Fabric crash reporting and analytics.
  * **September 6, 2016:** Added premium subscriptions and ads; reorganized analytics.



## Information we collect

When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an optional email address and a password.

We do not send promotional emails. Your email address, if supplied, is only used for:

  * Logging in.
  * Resetting your password if you forget it.
  * Notifying you of important account-related matters, should they arise. (To date, no email has ever been sent for this reason.)



We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress so we can sync this information between the website and any devices where you use the app. We also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics about app and site usage and crashes, and which podcasts are most subscribed and listened to.

If you enable push notifications, we need to store the token your device gives us to send them. We only ever use push notifications to initiate background downloads and notify you of new podcast episodes. We never use push notifications for marketing.

If you connect a Twitter account:

  * Episodes that you specifically “recommend” may appear in Overcast to people who follow you on Twitter, identifying you as the recommender.
  * Any podcasts you add to Overcast may appear to people who follow you on Twitter. You will not be identified as the source, although people may be able to deduce which podcasts likely came from you.
  * To provide these recommendations, we store a Twitter login token to periodically look up your Twitter username, avatar, and list of people you follow. This is a read-only token that cannot post tweets or make any changes to your account, and no other information is read or stored.
  * At any time, you can revoke Overcast’s access to your Twitter account in our app, or in your account settings on Twitter’s website.



If you upload files to Overcast, we need to store them until you delete them.

We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.

Like most websites and apps, we also store information through the use of software that may be transparent to users. For example, we may log your IP address and general information about your browser or device.

### **Premium subscription asking to share email, ZIP code, etc.**

If you subscribe to Overcast Premium in the app, an Apple system dialog may ask you to optionally share your email address, postal code, or other information with Overcast.

**We don’t want this data, and we encourage you to decline.** We may already have your email address for login purposes if you chose to share it with us, but we don’t care who you are or where you live.

But at the time of writing, Apple does not offer Overcast a way to opt out of this data collection, and it will be available to us from anyone who opts in. If we ever access this data, we will never use it for marketing purposes or disclose it to any third parties.

### **Additional information collected by anonymous analytics**

Overcast’s iOS app includes limited components of [Twitter’s Fabric](https://fabric.io/) to provide crash reporting and basic analytics to help us improve the app. These are aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features.

Overcast does not share your email address or any other personal data with Twitter. Other data, such as podcasts being played or shared, may be shared anonymously for aggregate statistical analysis to further improve the app.

### **Additional information collected by in-app ads**

Overcast’s iOS app includes [Google AdMob ads](https://www.google.com/admob/). Google may use the advertising identifier from your device(s) to infer interests, demographics, and other data to show you more relevant ads. Your device advertising identifier can be disabled or reset [by following these instructions from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074).

Overcast does not share your email address or any other personal data with Google. Other data, such as podcasts and genres being played or subscribed to, may be shared anonymously for ad targeting.

Becoming a Premium user disables all advertisements and sharing of targeting data.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Overcast’s functionality, except as specified above for analytics and in-app advertisements.

We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.

For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS, and passwords are not stored: they are [hashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) using advanced, well-researched methods. (At the time of writing, [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) is used, but that may be upgraded to a more advanced algorithm in the future such as [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) without notice.)

## Accessing your information

You may access or change your information or delete your account at any time by logging into the app or website.

## Third-party links and content

Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [privacy@overcast.fm](mailto:privacy@overcast.fm).

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date above.
