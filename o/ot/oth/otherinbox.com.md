# Privacy Policy | OtherInbox

Effective March 5, 2013

We recently updated our Privacy Policy. Our goal is provide a clear explanation of why and how information is collected. Please take a couple of minutes to read it, starting with the short summaries on the left. If anything is unclear, let us know. Thank you!

Thank you for taking the time to read our Privacy Policy. We want you to be fully informed about the information we collect, how it is used, shared, and protected, and the choices you have with it.

The mission of OtherInbox and our parent company, Return Path, Inc. (Return Path), is to make email better for everyone. We build products to make your inbox a safe and manageable place filled with email you want to receive and nothing more.

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Our business depends on the trust of thousands of companies and millions of people. Violating that trust is simply not an option. The following will give you a full understanding of privacy and data at OtherInbox. After you read it, please let us know if you have any questions at [privacy@otherinbox.com](mailto:privacy@otherinbox.com "Drop us a line"). We’ll be glad to help.

## What information do you collect?

We collect information about the commercial email you receive (such as the sender and subject line), remove any personal data, and combine it with data from millions of other messages to help make email better for everyone.

With your permission, OtherInbox connects to your email account and scans messages in order to organize and categorize email and/or to assist in unsubscribing from selected companies. As part of that process, we index commercial email received from companies like Amazon, Groupon, Facebook, and Old Navy. We retain data from these commercial messages, including the commercial sender’s name and its email address, subject line, message content, and whether the email was opened, moved, forwarded, clicked, or marked as spam. We also store the unsubscribe link if present.

From this collection of commercial message data, we remove all personal information, such as recipient name, recipient email address, postal address and other unique identifiers – specifically any Personally Identifiable Information about you. “Personally Identifiable Information” is data (for instance, an email address) that can be used to uniquely identify, or can be combined with other data to uniquely identify, a single individual.

We combine the remaining information with anonymous data from millions of other users. We make every effort to ensure that no part of the anonymized data can be traced to a specific email account or individual.

### Registration Data

When you start using an OtherInbox application, we store the IP address and country based on your Internet connection for help with troubleshooting and determining where our products are used.

### Cookies

Like most sites, we store cookies on your machine to save session information and make it easier for you to access the OtherInbox site and applications, as well as to provide statistics on how the site is used. The cookies are not used to store personal information or retain historical data. You can choose whether to use cookies with this site or any site by adjusting your browser preferences. Please note that disabling cookies may affect your experience of the site.

### Clear Gifs

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier which are included in HTML-based emails to let us know whether an email has been opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communication. You can always adjust which emails you receive within your app settings or opt-out by following the instructions included in each message.

### Information from Children

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, nor is our site or products targeted toward children. If you believe we have collected such information through our service, please notify us at [privacy@otherinbox.com](mailto:privacy@otherinbox.com "Contact Us") so that we may delete the information.

## How do you use collected information?

We use collected information to make OtherInbox applications useful for you.

We use collected information to meet our users expectations for how the products should perform and to diagnose system issues.

### Product Functionality

In order to provide OtherInbox’s services effectively, users grant access to their email accounts. With the user’s permission, OtherInbox scans, processes, moves, and stores commercial email messages. Depending on which OtherInbox services are selected, this information is used to create reports, move or modify messages, classify messages, extract useful information from messages, and to provide other services, such as unsubscribing. OtherInbox may also add functionality to the emails. OtherInbox never shares any information about you or your personal email messages with a third party.

### Troubleshooting

Information, including IP addresses, may be used to research and resolve a specific issue encountered while using an OtherInbox product, or to assist in troubleshooting a broader problem. Only OtherInbox employees tasked with resolving the issue have access to the information and only for that purpose.

## How do you share the information you collect?

We share anonymous, aggregated non-personal information with third parties to improve spam filters, help stop phishing attacks, and encourage companies to follow email best practices.

### **Non Personally Identifiable Information Sharing**

#### Improving Email with Return Path

We collect aggregate, anonymous information to improve the health and safety of the email ecosystem more broadly through our parent company, Return Path. The aggregated and anonymous data is shared with and utilized by Return Path and its clients to make email better for everyone, including:

  * Improving spam filters.
  * Detecting and helping stop phishing attacks.
  * Providing feedback to senders about their campaigns so they can adopt best practices.



### **Personally Identifiable Information Sharing**

Except for the limited situations listed here, we do not share your personal information with third parties.

#### Agents and Service Providers

To provide the service to you, we may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain specialized services such as data processing or other technology services. In such instances, those businesses may process data on our behalf, but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose.

#### Change of Control / Asset Transfer

In the future, OtherInbox or our parent company, Return Path, may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. In the event that the assets of OtherInbox in whole or in part are acquired by a third-party, we will notify you as described in the “Changes to this Policy” section of the policy if there are any changes to the way personal information is handled.

#### Legal Compliance

We may share user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is desirable or necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our users’ rights or property, OtherInbox or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. You agree that we may disclose user information to law enforcement when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. We will also surrender information if we are served with a subpoena.

## How do you secure and protect the information?

We are vigilant in protecting our users’ data. Access is monitored and limited to specific individuals.

OtherInbox utilizes commonly accepted and applicable industry-standard security technology to protect the transfer and storage of personal information. We continually evaluate, test, and improve our security infrastructure and processes.

Access to Personally Identifiable Information is limited to trained and authorized individuals for the purposes of fulfilling the service to you and troubleshooting system issues. Access is monitored for any potential concerns or violations.

## What communications do you send via email?

We will send emails based on your application settings. We may also send emails to all users or in response to a question you’ve asked.

As someone with an active OtherInbox account, we will send you service-related email messages, which are not promotional in nature, on occasions when it is necessary. Similarly, if you request assistance with the site or one of our products, we will communicate with you through email until we have addressed your questions.

Some products include features that rely on email communication. For example, Organizer users receive the Daily Digest via email. You can customize these features by adjusting the email settings within the app.

Finally, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to additional newsletters or promotional communications sent by email. You can opt-out of specific email communication at any time by following the instructions in those emails.

## Can I opt-out?

Yes, you can choose which emails you receive and unsubscribe from specific lists. You can also deactivate your account and request that all of your data be removed.

Yes. At any time, you can [deactivate your account](http://my.otherinbox.com/accounts "OtherInbox Account Settings") and request that we delete any and all Personally Identifiable Information that has been collected and stored. You can also email [privacy@otherinbox.com](mailto:privacy@otherinbox.com "Email any questions") or send a letter to the address below.

Aggregated, anonymous data is an essential part of our products. The data power sophisticated tools that help make email better, and allow us to offer OtherInbox products for free. At this time, the products cannot be used without participating in the collection of that data. If and when that changes, we will update the policy to reflect that.

You can opt-out of specific email communication we send by following the instructions in those emails. Some products have email settings within the apps that you can customize for your purposes. Please note that you will continue to receive system messages in response to your actions (resetting a password, for instance) and legal notices so long as you have an active OtherInbox account.

## Changes to this Policy

The Privacy Policy may change. We’ll notify you if it does.

The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting an announcement on our homepage and by changing the “Effective” date of this policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. By continuing to use the site and OtherInbox apps, you agree to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. If we ever change our policy to share personal data w/ third parties, we will notify you directly by email and seek your affirmative consent to continue participation. If at anytime you do not agree to these terms or changes to the policy, you may opt-out as noted in the Can I opt-out? section above.
