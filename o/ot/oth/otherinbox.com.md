The Organization Collecting Information at this Website
The mission of Return Path and its subsidiary companies is to make email better for everyone.
We build products and provide services to make your inbox a safe and manageable place filled
with email you want to receive and nothing more.
Our products and services include Context.IO (a product of our subsidiary, DokDok, Inc.),
OtherInbox, and Motley Bunch. We operate and own the websites (the “Sites”) located at:
    http://context.io/
    http://www.otherinbox.com/
    https://www.motleybunch.com
Through these Sites, we provide various email management and information products and
services through which users who register with us may analyze and manage email messages
received and better understand relevant data such as purchase and other information from
their email stored in their personal email accounts.
The Information We Collect and Use


We refer to the above products and services, as well as any of our other current or future
products and services, collectively as the “Service.” Any information provided to us through
the Service will be retained and used solely for the purposes of fulfilling your request for
information, fulfilling a request through a Site or Service feature, performing and carrying out
the Terms of the Service, performing or improving our Service, developing a new Service or
communicating with you as a user of Return Path’s services.
Registration Information
Registration for the Service may not required to simply view a Site. If you elect to register for a
Service, Return Path asks you for information that enables us to provide the Service. You will
be registering with Return Path on the form provided and such registration may require you to
provide contact information such as your name, username, password, and email address.
Service Usage Information
We collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association
with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal
information for any purpose. For example, when you use our services, we may collect data
from and about the commercial electronic mail messages, transactional or relationship
messages that are sent to your email accounts so that we can better understand the behavior
of the senders of such messages, as well as better understand our customer behavior and
improve our products, services, and advertising, and if we do disclose such messages, all
identifiable personal information will be removed prior to any such disclosure. If we do combine
non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as
personal information for as long as it remains combined.
The services Return Path offers are:
    Context.IO:
         Developers
             Your privacy, and that of your users, is of the utmost importance to us. Both your
              business and ours depend on the trust of thousands of companies and millions of
              people. Violating that trust is simply not an option. Just as we strive to be clear,
              we want you to fully inform your customers and users about the information you
              and we collect, how it is used, shared, and protected, and the choices they have
              with it. Please note that the Context.IO Developer Terms of Service contain some
              specific obligations applicable to you regarding your privacy and data practices.
              These obligations include things such as ensuring that you are publishing a
              sufficient privacy policy to your End Users, that it is available to your users for
              review in a sufficient manner, and that specific disclosures exist which allow for
              the Context.IO Services to be utilized within your mobile or web product or


          service. If you are a developer and have powered your mobile or email application
          with Context.IO, please review your Developer Terms of Service
    Service End-Users
         If you are an email user using a mobile or email application powered by
          Context.IO, please review the following. With your permission at sign up or use of
          the application, Return Path and Context.IO collect personal information and
          provide and market our products and services to our users when you register with
          us. This includes but is not limited to your name, email address, your username,
          and password. Context.IO may also collect Personal Information from visitors
          when they communicate with us about our services and products or during other
          transactions or interactions. Context.IO will use Personal Information to provide
          services and products requested by you and to enable its vendors and contractors
          to provide and assist Context.IO in the marketing and provision of such services
          and products to you. We also use it to improve spam filters, detect and help stop
          phishing attacks, help companies adopt best practices, and analyze how people
          interact with commercial email. You may opt-out at anytime for Context.IO data
          collection practices at http://optout.context.io or marketing information via the opt-
          out link contained within the email.
 Motley Bunch:
    With your permission, Return Path connects to your email account(s) that you choose
     in your sole discretion to link with the Site. Return Path then provides a service
     whereby our servers scan your mailbox for commercial messages and purchase-
     related emails from your inbox for those connected accounts and organizes them into
     your personal catalog. By connecting your email account(s) to our service, you grant
     us permission to access and use, from your email, purchase and shipping-related data
     and other information such as product names and identifiers, order identifiers, items
     purchased, tracking numbers, name, account number, as well as information
     regarding your shopping preferences such as product wish lists, order history, tracking
     number, open and clicks, what you bought, how much you paid for it, where you
     bought it, and marketing preferences. From this collection of commercial message
     data, we will then remove or replace all personal information such as recipient name,
     recipient email address, postal address and the other unique identifiers – specifically
     any Personal Information – with non-identifying data points and may share that non-
     personal information with third parties for purposes of performing analytics and market
     research.
 OtherInbox:
    With your permission, Return Path connects to your email account(s) that you choose
     in your sole discretion to link with the Site. Return Path then provides a service
     whereby our servers scan your mailbox to inventory, organize and categorize email


          and/or to assist in unsubscribing from selected companies. As part of that process, we
          index information about commercial email companies who have sent you email.
          Examples like FROM domain, FROM IP Address, Message Subject line, Message
          Date, and Message Body URLs. We retain data from these commercial messages,
          about the commercial sender, including their name and reply email address, Message
          Subject line, and message content and unsubscribe link (if present). We also retain
          user usage data points, including whether the email was opened, moved, forwarded,
          clicked, or marked as spam. From this collection of commercial message data, we
          remove or replace all personal information with non-identifying data points, such as
          recipient name, recipient email address, postal address and the other unique
          identifiers – specifically any Personal Information about you – and store it. We may
          then share that non-personal information with third parties for purposes of performing
          analytics and market research.
Aggregate Information
From time to time, we may collect general, non-identifiable personal, statistical information
about the use of the Sites and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on
the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We
collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”,
which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate
visitor data in order to describe the use of the Sites and Service to our existing or potential
business partners or other third parties (such as Google Analytics), or in response to a
government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way
personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Sites.
We may store your personal information along with your files and data on a third party server
such as Amazon Web Services; or we may use a third party analytics tool to learn how you are
using our Sites.
In cases where you use a mobile device to access our Sites, we will receive information about
the location of your device. In some cases, even if you are not using a mobile device,
information about your general location may be discernable from your device’s IP address or
the URLs we receive. If you access or use our Sites or Services with your mobile telephone,
we may collect your telephone number.
Cookies and other Tracking Technologies
Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Return Path, Inc. and
our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are
used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site
and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive
reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as
aggregated basis. We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference),


tracking for marketing purposes, and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at
the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to
use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
      Log Files
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream
data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
      Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our
advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to
gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you
advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this
information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by
clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you
out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
Profile
We store information that we collect through cookies and clear gifs to create a “profile” of your
preferences. We tie your personal information to information in the profile to provide tailored
promotions and marketing offers or to improve the content of the Sites for you.
We do not share your personal identifiable profile with unapproved third parties. We undertake
to ensure that your personal information is kept strictly confidential and is not disclosed to third
parties without your permission. Details will be used only by our staff and/or approved agents
to support the necessary terms and conditions for use of service such as service providers
under contract who help with our business operations and technology services. Our contracts
dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services
they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
Retention of Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period applicable by law. We will make good
faith efforts to delete the data if you contact us by following the instructions at the beginning
and at the end of this Privacy Policy, provided Return Path is not required to retain it by law or
for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are
extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. We will retain


your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If
you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide
you services contact us by completing this simple online form.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Except for the limited situations listed here in this Privacy Policy, we will not share
your identifiable personal information with unapproved third parties. To the extent we are
legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are
required to provide your personal information to unapproved third parties as part of legal
process.
Agents and Third Party Service Providers
To provide the Service to you, we may sometimes use other approved third party businesses
or affiliates to perform certain specialized services such as data processing or other
technology services. Your information collected through the Return Path Service may be
stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Return Path,
approved third party businesses, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Return
Path may transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Data, to affiliated
entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other
countries or jurisdictions around the world. They are not permitted to retain or use your
information for any other purposes other than what is defined as the service in our Terms of
Use and this privacy policy. If you are located in the European Union, Switzerland or other
regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note
that we may transfer information, including Personal Data, to a country and jurisdiction that
does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the
transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Return Path or its parent,
subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of
information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
Change of Control / Asset Transfer
As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of
our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in
such transactions. Thus, in the event that the assets of the Company in whole or in parts are
acquired by a third-party, customer information, including any visitor information collected
through the Sites or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a
corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets our users will be
notified in accordance with the “Changes to this Policy” section of the policy if their personal
information is provided to the new corporate entity or asset purchaser.
Legal Compliance
As we stated, Return Path values our relationships with our Users and are committed to
respecting and protecting your Usage Information. Return Path can however disclose Users’
Usage Information for legal or regulatory reasons, including in response to subpoenas and


court orders. Return Path can also use Usage Information to investigate fraud and to prevent
violation of our Terms of Service and unlawful use of our network, services and other Users.
Return Path also reserves the right to disclose member information in special cases when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring
legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally or unintentionally) Return Path’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or
anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Return Path also reserves the right to
disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
it.
