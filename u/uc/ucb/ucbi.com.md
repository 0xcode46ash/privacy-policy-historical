Privacy Statement

**United Community Banks, Inc.**  
Our financial institution is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information. Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer information collected and shared in today's marketplace. Consumers are concerned about the impact this development has or might have on their privacy and reputation. We are sensitive to these concerns. We want to serve consumers as effectively and conveniently as possible. But we also want our customers to be confident that their relationship with our financial institution is treated with the appropriate confidentiality. We therefore commit to customers that we will take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of the information shared with us. Our customers are protected not only by state and federal laws but even more importantly by our commitment to them. 

**Confidentiality and Security of Nonpublic Personal Information** \- We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

**Nonpublic Personal Information We Collect** \- We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency



We have established internal procedures and controls to ensure personal and account information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with customary and reasonable business standards. We also have established procedures to correct any inaccurate information in a timely manner. If you discover any information we have about you which is incorrect, please notify us immediately.

**Nonpublic Personal Information We Disclose** \- We do not disclose information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as outlined in this policy or as permitted or required by law.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting act we are allowed to share our information concerning your account history and transaction experience between our affiliates. We do not share information between our affiliates that was provided to us by third parties (such as credit report from a credit bureau or employment history from your employer) unless you have given us permission to share the information. We share information with our affiliates so that we can provide you with the best services our company has to offer. Our affiliates include our mortgage company, Investment Company, and our affiliate banks.

Sometimes we find it necessary to enter into an arrangement with an outside company to provide support services for our company (imprinted checks, printing and mailing loan coupon books, on-line banking, etc.). These companies are contractually required to adhere to the same standards of keeping your information confidential and secure as we are. They are not allowed to use your information for their own marketing purposes or for any other intended services.

In order to provide you with quality products and services, we will occasionally enter into joint marketing agreements with respectable companies to provide products on our behalf (such as credit cards or insurance). We may disclose to these companies information we receive from your application such as your name, address, assets or income. We may also share information about your transactions with our affiliates or us. Again, the partners must agree to strictly safeguard your information, and they are not allowed to disclose your information to anyone else without our permission.

In accordance with standard banking industry practices and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we share customer information with reputable consumer reporting agencies.

We also disclose information as permitted or required by federal and state laws, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.

Except as described above, we do not share customer information with anyone unless you expressly authorize or request it in writing. Our policy for protecting customer information applies to both former and current customers, and regardless of whether your account is active or inactive.

**Notify Us of Inaccurate Information We Report To Consumer Reporting Agencies** \- Please notify us if we report any inaccurate information about your account(s) to a consumer reporting agency.

**Your privacy on our website is also very important to us**. When you sign up for Internet Banking or Internet Bill Payment, we will request personal information about you and your accounts with us. This allows us to process your request accurately and ensure that an unauthorized individual does not access your accounts. We have safeguards in place to ensure that this information is protected and that our website is secure.

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss them with you.
