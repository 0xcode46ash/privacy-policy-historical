## UCS Privacy Statement

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. We have developed the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online. 

**Website Usage  
** Most areas of our site are accessible without having to provide personal information of any kind. Some of our services do, however, require some form of identification, which the user is free to provide (or withhold) voluntarily. Submission of a registration form that includes the user's phone number or email address implies the user's consent to being contacted by UCS, but we will not share this information with third parties.

UCS also collects aggregate website browsing information including (but not limited to) IP address, domain name, page views, and Internet browser. This information is used to improve our website and will not be disclosed to third parties.

**Cookies  
** Like most websites, UCS places a "cookie," or small text file, in the browser files of visitors to our site. This cookie is used to collect website traffic information and does not collect personally identifiable information about a user. Nevertheless, users retain the right to reject our cookie.

**Collection of Personal Information  
** UCS may collect personal information (such as the user's email address) when it is voluntarily submitted to www.ucsusa.org. Submission of such information implies the user's consent to being contacted by UCS, but we do not share our email list with third parties.

If you become a financial contributor to UCS, your postal mailing address may be exchanged with other organizations. We do not sell or exchange email addresses. Exchanging membership lists with other like-minded groups extends the reach of our work by helping us recruit new members. Members may opt out of such list exchanges at any time by sending an email including your full name and address to our membership department([member@ucsusa.org](mailto:member@ucsusa.org)).

UCS stores member information on secure servers. We accept credit card donations via a secure server only.

If you use the UCS action center to submit comments to a government agency your comments, name, mailing and email address _may_ be posted on the agency's web site in accordance with agency public records policies.

**Privacy Policy Changes  
** UCS continually examines the best options for maintaining a high level of privacy on our site. From time to time, therefore, this privacy policy may be changed. Your use of the UCS website after the date specified below constitutes your agreement to our terms.
