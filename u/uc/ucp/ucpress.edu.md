##  **Online Privacy Policy**

The University of California Press, on behalf of the Regents of the University of California, is the sole owner and operator of this site which includes the sites for University of California [Books](https://web.archive.org/books), [Journals](https://web.archive.org/journals), and the [SCAN](https://web.archive.org/scan/) Project. 

Our Web server automatically recognizes only the domain name of each visitor to our Web site, not the e-mail address. This information is used to help improve the site's functionality. We make use of Cookies technology in our shopping cart, but that information is stored on the visitor's computer, not on our server. The shopping cart accesses that information to allow the visitor to collect items in a personal shopping cart, remove them, change them, and add to them indefinitely without making a purchase. The shopping cart keeps track of the visitor's selections and calculates charges. The information stored in Cookies is never collected, reviewed, or in any way made use of except in the automated processing of the customer's submitted order. (If you would like to know more about Cookies, please see [more about Cookies](http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/HTTP/Protocol_Specification/Persistent_Cookies/) from Yahoo.) If a customer places an order, that name and street address are stored in our order processing system (e-mail addresses are not stored) and the customer may receive follow-up mailings from us with information on new titles or upcoming events. If a customer does not wish to receive such mailings or does not wish to have his or her name made available to other similar organizations, it is requested that we receive notification in writing at the address below. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our online privacy policy, please contact us:
