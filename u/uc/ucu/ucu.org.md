# Privacy Policy - University Credit Union, Los Angeles, CA

  |   


#### Privacy Policy  


University Credit Union (UCU) places a high priority on keeping member information confidential and secure. We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and financial affairs. We understand the need to safeguard sensitive information about you that you have entrusted to us. The following is UCU's Privacy Policy for Member Account Information and for Internet usage. 

****

**Member Accounts Guidelines**

The Credit Union and our affiliate, UCU Financial Center Inc., understand the importance of protecting the privacy of our members. As such, we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of each member's financial records consistent with state and federal laws. The following sets forth our policies regarding our use and protection of your financial information. During the course of business we collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;
  * Information we obtain when verifying the information we receive from you;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others;
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.



Generally, we may share all information that we may collect from you as described above, with third parties to complete transactions and maintain accounts and related records (such as data processing transactions and records). We may also share such information with select nonaffiliated third parties if: 1) you request or authorize it; 2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you; 3) the information is provided to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act; or 4) the disclosure otherwise is lawfully required or permitted.

Also, we may enter into agreements with other businesses to provide support or services to us or for one or more of our products, such as mailing houses that assist us in delivering your statements and other promotional materials. Under certain circumstances we may also enter into joint marketing agreements with other financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers, and insurance companies and agents. Before entering into relationships with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our membersı information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws.

Furthermore, we may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to other nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties not described above as permitted by law.

In addition, the Credit Union is affiliated with a Credit Union Service Organization, UCU Financial Center Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of UCU. The Credit Union and UCU Financial Center Inc. work together and share information about your accounts to provide the products and services you want.

In addition to safeguarding you as an active member, if you decide to terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this notice.

Because of the limited way we share information with nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties, we are not required to provide you with the opportunity to opt-out from the disclosure of information to such third parties.

We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. Our employees access information about you when needed to administer your accounts, to provide requested services, or in response to a legally valid outside request or order (such as a subpoena). In addition, our employees may also access information to exercise our rights under the law or pursuant to any agreement with you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

We strive to ensure that our records contain accurate information about you. If you see any inaccuracies in your statements, please call (310) 477-6628 or e-mail us at ucumail@ucu.org. We will promptly investigate and make any necessary changes to update your records.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), it is the Credit Union's practice to share Transaction/Experience Information (as defined by the FCRA) with its affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to the extent permitted by law.

We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our active members with copies of our new policies at that time.

**Internet Guidelines**

**Protecting Online Applications**  
When you apply online for accounts or use the Home Branch online banking service, you provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your application. To ensure that your information remains confidential, all sessions are established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts and decodes all data transmitted only between your browser and the UCU server. For more information on security and recommended browsers, please see the [Home Branch Security](http://www.ucu.org/hb_security.htm) on our Web site.

It is recommended that when using a browser containing any personal data, that you end the browser session so other users or persons do not have access to your personal information.

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**  
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, UCU employs software programs to monitor Web site traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or modify information, or otherwise cause damage.

UCU also uses software programs to collect statistical information about the use of UCU's Web site and applications contained therein. Programs are used to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. No personal information, such as your name or address is collected or used for this analysis. We collect no information that would identify you personally, unless you give your authorization for us to retain that information. Any data automatically stored is kept as the confidential records of the credit union and is not sold or distributed in part or whole to any third party. 

**Use of Cookies on the UCU Web Site**  
UCU only utilizes the use of [cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20020609132901id_/http%3A//www.ucu.org/hb_faq.htm#4) in its Home Branch application.

**Information Collected from E-mails and Web Forms**  
UCU uses personally identifiable information from an electronic mail message containing a question or comment or from a form that e-mails us information to fulfill a request for information or to respond to your requests. UCU reserves the right to store these requests to assist us in following up or maintaining service quality of requests or to provide us with information for future improvements to our Web site. We may forward your electronic message or request to other employees who are better able to respond to your particular need. We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide. UCU may keep e-mail addresses or data that you personally authorize us to keep (for internal marketing or promotional purposes). UCU does not give, sell or transfer personal information to third parties, unless required by law.
