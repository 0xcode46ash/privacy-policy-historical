You can choose to decline acceptance of all cookies, but your ability to browse certain pages of the site may be reduced. The cookies used by Uploadcare are intended to enable or facilitate communication, to enable the services requested by users to be supplied, to recogniяe users when they re-visit the site, to secure payments which users may make, or other preferences necessary for the service requested to be supplied and to enable Uploadcare, internally, to carry out analyses on hit rates and browsing experience so as to improve content, to track email open rates, click rates, and bounce-back rates at individual levels.

By default, cookies are not installed automatically (except for those cookies needed to run the site and Uploadcare’s services, and you are informed of their installation by a clickable banner with a text description). In accordance with the regulations that apply, Uploadcare will require your authorization before implanting any other kind of cookie to your local storage.

## SECURITY

Within the framework of its services, Uploadcare attributes the very highest importance to the security and integrity of its customers’ personal data.

Thus and in accordance with the GDPR, Uploadcare undertakes to take all pertinent precautions in order to preserve the security of the data and, in particular, to protect them against any accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, corruption, unauthorized circulation or access, as well as against any other form of unlawful processing or disclosure to unauthorized persons.

To this end, Uploadcare implements industry standard security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized disclosure. In using industry recommended methods of encoding, Uploadcare takes the measures necessary to protect information connected with payments and credit cards.

Moreover, to avoid in particular all unauthorized access, to guarantee accuracy and the proper use of the data, Uploadcare has put the appropriate electronic, physical and managerial procedures in place to safeguarding and preserving the data gathered through its services.

Notwithstanding this, there is no absolute safety from piracy or hackers. That is why in the event a breach of security was to affect you, Uploadcare undertakes to inform you thereof without undue delay and to use its best efforts to take all possible measures to neutralize the intrusion and minimize the impacts. Should you suffer any loss by reason of the exploitation by a third party of a security breach, Uploadcare undertakes to provide you with every assistance necessary, so that you can assert your rights.

You should keep in mind that any user, customer or hacker who discovers and takes advantage of a breach in security renders him or herself liable to criminal prosecution and that Uploadcare will take all measures, including filing a complaint and/or bringing court action, to preserve the data and the rights of its users and of itself and to limit the impacts.
