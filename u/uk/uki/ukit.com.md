# uKit â€” Privacy policy

This website is owned and operated by the uKit Company. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us, because we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

 **Information Gathered by uKit**

uKit gathers two types of information about users

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions when creating a uKit account such as your name or email address.
  * Information uKit gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our websites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does uKit provide any information about an individual user to a third party except as required by law.



uKit gathers user data during the following processes:

 _Optional Voluntary Information_

We offer free services which require provision of certain personal details by users in the following cases:

  * Signing up on the uKit website to use the provided services  
When creating an account, the user is required to provide a full name, email address, country, date of birth, sex, and enter a password. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Any files uploaded or created in the uKit website builder are in fact public and are thus publicly accessible unless they are stored in places with restricted access.
  * Polling  
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and so that we can see what our audience thinks about important issues. Poll results are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. uKit may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
  * Surveys  
uKit may occasionally conduct optional user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We may sometimes share the aggregated demographic information from these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.



 _Underage_

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

 _User Tracking_

uKit tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our websites. However, we do not correlate this information with the data about individual users. uKit analyzes overall usage statistics by a user's domain name, country, browser type, and operating system, reading this information from the browser (information contained in every user's browser).  
uKit tracks the search queries which users enter into our Search fields, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our websites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather count the overall views of each page. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

 _Cookies_

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this website to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. uKit also uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).  
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this website. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polls and surveys and to log into the Dashboard.

 **Use of Information**

uKit uses information voluntarily given by our users to add new features and improve the existing ones based on the needs and interests of our users.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our websites are most popular based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather count the overall views of each page. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search queries entered into the Search field as one of many measurements of what interests our users.

uKit creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This allows us to more effectively tailor services to our users. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with the applicable law or valid legal process.

 **Sharing of Information**

uKit uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help us better understand our audience's demographics. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with the applicable law or valid legal process.

 **Security**

All payment procedures of uKit operate on secure data networks protected by industry encryption standards. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

 **No Spyware/Adware**

We have a strict policy against spyware and adware applied to all uKit users. Any such activity by uKit users leads to immediate termination of their accounts without any notice.

 **Refund Policy**

During the Guarantee Period (14 days) uKit guarantees a full refund to the User upon the User's request. The refund request shall include a significant reason for the refund. All requests will be processed and resolved individually. If you think that you should be refunded, please contact us.  
Upon expiration of the Guarantee Period a refund is not possible.

 **Your Consent**

By using this website, you agree to collecting and use of the described information by uKit. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
