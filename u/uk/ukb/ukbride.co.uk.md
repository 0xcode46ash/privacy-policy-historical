# Privacy Policy

## Data Protection

UKbride has been created by Whitespace Publishers Ltd Ltd and Web On High. The site is populated under its Editor and Data Controller, [Rob Davis](mailto:julian@lincolnshirepride.co.uk), of Whitespace Publishers Ltd. 

In all cases where you provide personal information, we will use this information to deliver the services you have requested, and for our internal administration and marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third party companies.

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 including a right to request a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we will charge an administration fee of Â£5.00). You also have the right to ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free). To make such a request, send an email to [julian@lincolnshirepride.co.uk](mailto:julian@lincolnshirepride.co.uk) including the email address that you registered with along with your full postal address and postcode.

This privacy policy may change without notice, therefore, it may be useful to check back periodically to note any changes.

## Personal Information

The site stores personal information by those creating an Eternity membership login name and password. Information pertaining to this will be kept on our servers along with details you submit both relating to your wedding planning and to those who you have entered into our My Guest List, My Table Plan and My Address Book. Brides may send you an email if you choose to publish your website via the site.

Information will not be passed onto third party businesses by ourselves unless you have indicated that you allow us to do so, but you may choose to email suppliers and other businesses or contact other brides and grooms on the site yourself.

UKbride does not automatically capture or store personal information, other than logging the user's IP address and session information such as the duration of the visit and the type of browser used. This is recognised by the Web server and is only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which Web on High and Whitespace Publishers Ltd may compile to evaluate site use.
