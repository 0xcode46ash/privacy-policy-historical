# UK Property Shop: Privacy Policy

##### Privacy Policy

The National Directory of Estate Agents, published by UK Property Shop, provides a free Enquiry Service to help you contact estate agents listed in the Directory. Your requirements will be forwarded immediately by email to each agent that you select and we will also send you an email to confirm what we have done. Agents who subscribe to one of our membership services are authorised exclusively to receive your email address and telephone numbers; other agents receive only your name and postal address contact information.

As an extension of our Enquiry Service we may also provide a Product Request service, so that you can ask any of our chosen associate partners to contact you; when you tick the box next to any of the companies listed, we will email your contact details and requirements direct to them. In addition, we may pass your details to other selected individual companies that we think could help you in the process of moving home and we may also add your details to our own mailing list so that we can contact you in the future. When you use any of these free services you agree to opt-in to these mailing lists, however you are under no obligation to purchase products that may be offered.

When you use the Enquiry Service for the first time, we may place a 'cookie' on your own computer. A cookie is a small file that can be accessed only by our own computer system and contains just your registration details; we can then use the cookie to retrieve your details automatically each time you carry out a new search and decide to contact more estate agents. However, if you access UK Property Shop using a shared computing facility, you may wish to disable this feature within your own browser. We sometimes use ad-servers such as DoubleClick to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our website, who may also use cookies in the process of serving their advertisements, but it will not collect any personally identifiable information about you; for more information about DoubleClick and how to opt-out please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

Other than in the circumstances referred to here, we will not sell or distribute your personal information to any other party. UK Property Shop reserves the right to make enquiries about any visitor to our website in order to verify that the information supplied by us is used only for the purposes for which it is authorised. Please also see our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203025312id_/http%3A//www.ukpropertyshop.co.uk/conditions.shtml).

Thank you for visiting UK Property Shop.
