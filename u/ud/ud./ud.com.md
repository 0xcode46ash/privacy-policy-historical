# United Devices, Inc. (TM) - Privacy and Data Security Policy

Privacy and Data Security  


United Devices understands that privacy is a serious concern for its Participants, and wants to be very clear regarding its policy on privacy issues. We want Participants to understand what information we collect, and how it will be used. First, you should understand that you can assist UD in accelerating science without providing information any more personal than your E-Mail address and zip code. No name or street address is required. We do, however, need certain basic information regarding your machine in order to run our projects, which we will obtain automatically when you download our software. Under no circumstances will your E-Mail address be provided to advertisers or any other third parties. Information about your machine may be provided to UD's customers (whose data your machine is processing), but will be released in aggregate form only, with no information to identify the individual owners of the machines. 

If you elect to enter our sweepstakes or participate in other incentive programs, you will need to provide additional information (name, address, and contact phone) so that the contests or promotions can be administered (if you won a prize we'd need to know how to find you!) But again, this information is for UD internal use only and under no circumstances would it be revealed to any advertiser or third party, other than our contest administrator - and they have agreed to abide by our policy as well. 

You can request the individual information UD has collected about you via the Internet by E-Mailing [webmaster@ud.com](mailto:webmaster@ud.com). Any factual inaccuracies in this information may be corrected by contacting [webmaster@ud.com](mailto:webmaster@ud.com). 

On our Web site, we utilize standard technology, commonly known as "cookies", to help us deliver a customized experience to Participants. Our primary use for cookies is to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to your machine. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. Our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience when using our Web site. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our policy, please contact us at [webmaster@ud.com](mailto:webmaster@ud.com).
