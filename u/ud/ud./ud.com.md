# How It Works : Member Privacy and Security - United Devices, Inc.™

Member Privacy and Security  
  


[](https://www.truste.org/validate/10269) If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [member services](https://web.archive.org/contact/member_services.htm). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

Our Members have placed great trust in us to allow our project applications to run on their systems, and this is a trust we return and foster. United Devices understands that privacy is a serious concern for its Members. We don't want to be invasive on either a personal or technical level. Our agent runs unobtrusively in the computing background and is not invasive. And we treat our members with the highest level of personal respect: we don't open members up to security risks, unwanted spam, or invasion of privacy.

What We Collect from Members  
  


When Members first register with us, we give them the opportunity to decide what kind of news and information, if any, they wish to receive from us. We also let Members change those preferences at any later date. We will not sell, rent, or in ANY way distribute a Member's name or email address to any third parties other than our promotions administrators to notify winners-and they also must keep that information private. 

In order to run our projects, United Devices needs certain basic information regarding a Member's machine; our software detects this information automatically upon download. This information about a Member's machine may be provided to United Devices' customers or to certain companies we partner with, but will be released in aggregate form only, with no information to identify the individuals. 

Neither United Devices and our customers will ever access any information on a Member computer or identify anything else for which you use your computer. 

Members must complete the promotion registration section of the member registration to be legally entered into our sweepstakes or promotions. This information includes: first name; last name; street address; city; state; zip code; country; birth date; telephone (optional) and gender (optional). This information is used to assess eligibility and contact you if you win. 

The United Devices web site provides members with a feature to send an e-mail message to a friend, telling them about United Devices. The recipients e-mail address is only used for sending the e-mail and is not stored. 

The United Devices web site provides visitors with e-mail forms to send inquiries to various departments (Sales, Business Development, Public Relations, Events, Suggestions, Member Services and Technical Support). The information provided is only used to answer the inquiry or respond to the request. 

Members are asked to create a member name when they install the UD Agent. This member name is maintained in the member registration form and used to identify each member on the UD web site and on any scoreboards. 

Tracking Technology  
  


We use standard tracking technology on our Web site, commonly known as "cookies," to help us deliver a customized experience to Members. Our Web site will save a small temporary file on your computer only while you are visiting our site; it will be removed when you exit the United Devices Web site. Our primary use for cookies is to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to a Member's machine. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about individual members-we don't. If you have questions or concerns regarding our policy, or if you want to request the individual information UD has collected about you via the Internet, contact us at [member services](https://web.archive.org/contact/member_services.htm).
