# How It Works : Member Privacy and Security - United Devices, Inc.™

The United Devices Member Policy   


[](https://www.truste.org/validate/10269) If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should first contact [member services](https://www.ud.com/company/contact/member_services.htm). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

United Devices' Community Members have placed great trust in us to allow our project applications to run on their systems, and this is a trust we return and foster. We treat our members with the highest level of personal respect: we don't open members up to security risks, unwanted spam, or invasion of privacy. Here is our policy:

United Devices assures Members that applications will not damage their systems or invade their privacy in any way. Our agent runs unobtrusively in the computing background and is not invasive. It cannot detect or change any other files or material on Members machines. It can only update project-specific data in its own files.

United Devices Members will always be told what projects they are running. They also will have access to Web pages outlining which organizations are providing the project applications and explaining those projects. Members always have the option of opting out of a project. United Devices offers the opportunity to win prizes and other rewards to thank our members who choose to run our commercial applications in addition to non-profit projects. 

Members will be able to control how much of their system resources are used by United Devices and will be given user preference options on a wide range of factors, including:   
  


To protect Member privacy, Members are asked to create a member name when they install the UD Agent. This member name is maintained in the Member profile and used to identify each member on the UD web site and on any scoreboards.

We use standard tracking technology on our Web site, commonly known as "cookies," to help us deliver a customized experience to Members. Our Web site will save a small temporary file on your computer only while you are visiting our site; it will be removed when you exit the United Devices Web site. Our primary use for cookies is to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to a Member's machine. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about individual members — we do not.

In order to run our projects, United Devices software automatically detects certain basic information from a Member's machine; this includes info about the Member's processor speed, and set preferences regarding disk space, memory and times to run the projects on the machine. Members will have access to the information about the properties that are measured by the UD Agent and for what purpose this information will be used.

United Devices may provide aggregate member information such as average computing power and geographic dispersion to partners or customers. The information will be released in aggregate form only and, no personally identifiable information will ever be released. Neither United Devices nor our customers can access any other information on a Member computer or identify anything else for which a Member uses his or her computer.

To be legally entered into our sweepstakes or promotions, Members must complete the promotion registration section of the member registration. This information includes: first name; last name; street address; city; state; zip code; country; birth date; telephone (optional) and gender (optional). This information is used to assess eligibility and contact you if you win.

While United Devices will store the e-mail addresses of all Members in its database for prize and promotion distribution, we will not sell, rent, or in ANY way distribute a Member's name or email address to any third parties other than our promotions administrators to notify winners-and they also must keep that information private.

United Devices gives Members the opportunity to decide what kind of news and information, if any, they wish to receive from us. We also let Members change those preferences at any later date.

The United Devices web site provides visitors with e-mail forms to send inquiries to various departments (Sales, Business Development, Public Relations, Events, Suggestions, Member Services and Technical Support). The information provided is only used to answer the inquiry or respond to the request.

The United Devices web site provides members with a feature to send an e-mail message to a friend, telling them about United Devices. The recipients e-mail address is only used for sending the e-mail and is not stored.

The United Devices web site contains links to other web sites, this privacy statement applies only to the United Devices web site. Please review the privacy statement of any site before submitting your personally identifiable information.

Any change in information usage practices will be posted on this Privacy Statement. If there is a change in our information usage practices that affects your Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify you by e-mail and provide an opportunity for you to opt-out by sending a message to [member services](https://www.ud.com/company/contact/member_services.htm).

If you have questions or concerns regarding our policy, or if you want to request the individual information UD has collected about you via the Internet, contact us at [member services](https://www.ud.com/company/contact/member_services.htm).
