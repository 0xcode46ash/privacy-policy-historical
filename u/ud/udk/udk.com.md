### Information We Collect

### _Information You Provide Directly to Us_

You may choose to provide personal information (such as your email address) through our Epic Sites. Here are the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit.  We also tell you how we may use the information. ****

  * **Email Alerts**

You may sign up to receive email alerts about: (1) technical updates to the Unreal Engine 3 UDK or (2) surveys, contests, promotions, and other news sponsored by Epic and sometimes by Epic’s business partners and other third parties; (3) subscription registration; (4) user surveys; and (vi) registration for online multi- or single-player gaming, either through the Epic Sites or through the game itself.  If you wish to sign up, we ask for your email address.  We use this information to send you the alerts and information you request.  We may also contact you regarding account status, changes to this Notice or our Terms of Service to confirm your registration or for any other business reason related to your use of Epic Sites. 

  * **Membership Information**

When you register for membership on an Epic Site, we may ask you for additional information, such as your name, birth date, gender and zip code. We may also ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand your preferences and tailor the Epic Sites to suit you better. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the Epic Site and our efforts to your interests. 




### _Information We Collect by Automated Means_

We obtain certain information by automated means when you visit one or more of our Epic Sites, such as your computer’s locale and time zone as well as certain information about your operating system, service pack language, processor name, count and speed, SSE capability, memory size and speed, hard drive size and free space, video card driver and description, vendor id, device id, and resolution.  We may gather data about the areas of the Epic Sites you visit or access. We do not use any of this data to identify you or where you "as an individual user" go on Epic Sites.  However, we may use and share this data in statistical, aggregate, non-personal form to understand our users as a group, the hardware and software they prefer to use and how they use the Epic Sites. **   
**  
Like many companies, we also automatically collect information through “cookies”.  Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites.  Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  We use cookies, for example, for authentication purposes and to measure session activity on the site and determine which areas and features of the site are the most popular.  Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies.  Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our site features. 

### Information We Share

We may share personal information we collect on this site with partners and with service providers that perform services on our behalf.  These partners and service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.  We require our service providers by contract to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they process on our behalf. 

We may share information that is not personal information -- meaning non-personal, aggregate, or summary information that does not identify you individually -- with other third parties not mentioned in this Policy. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice. ****

### Your Choices

Subject to applicable law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward.  You may exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below. **  **

### Access and Correction

Subject to applicable law, you have the right to request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in the information, and have the information blocked or deleted, as appropriate.  The right to access personal information may be limited in some circumstances by local law.  Please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.  Please include your name, email address and postal address in your request.

### How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing.  ****

### Links to Other Sites

The Epic Sites provides links to other sites for your convenience and information.  These sites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Epic.  Linked sites may have their own privacy policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites.  We are not responsible for the content of any websites that are not affiliated with Epic, any use of those sites, or the privacy practices of those sites. ****

### Children’s Privacy

This website is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the site.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on the site, we will delete the information from our records.
