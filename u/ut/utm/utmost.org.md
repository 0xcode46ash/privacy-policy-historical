Any personally identifiable information (name, address, telephone number(s), and/or e-mail address) that you submit to us is used only for the purpose for which it was given.
  2. **Collection and Use of Personal Information.** Depending on how you use the Site, we may ask you to share personally identifiable information (“ **Personal Information** ”) with us. It is your choice whether you share any Personal Information with us, however some parts of the Site may not be available without sharing Personal Information. Personal Information includes any information that identifies, or can be used to identify, contact or locate you. Some examples of when we ask for and collect Personal Information include: 
    1. **When creating an ODB account.** When creating an account you will provide your e-mail and mailing address and may also elect to provide preferential and interest-based information. This allows us to send you updates, contact you regarding announcements, system updates, new ministry products and offerings, and other information.

  4. **Information Collected.** We collect information from you in several different ways on the Site.

To deliver you the product(s) or service(s) you requested, we may need to disclose Personal Information to any of our global ODB offices and affiliates. 
    1. We have entered into agreements with trusted agents and business members who provide support services and equipment necessary for ODB and its ministry associates to provide their products and services. We may share data with these trusted agents and business associates. For example, if you make a purchase from us, the information you provide will be collected by our processing agent, and your credit card information will be provided to our credit card processor so that we can complete the sale. Please do not submit information that you do not wish to have shared.
    2. We collect anonymous 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) through Google Analytics. We use this information to improve and personalize the Site. We may also use this information to identify opportunities to tailor content to an audience(s).

    4. ODB and DHP are non-profit ministries supported by the gifts of faithful friends and members. We do not send any direct gift solicitations to our contacts or anyone on our mailing list.
