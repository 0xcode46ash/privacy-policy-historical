This privacy statement was last updated on 2/1/06 and also applies to other domain names associated with this Web site: (RBC.org/DHP.org and other domain names registered with RBC Ministries).  


**PRIVACY STATEMENT**  


Information collected on this site will be used according to the following guidelines:  


  1. **Personal Information Policy.** RBC.org is an online Web site of RBC Ministries (RBC), publishers of _Our Daily Bread,_ and itsÂ affiliates Discovery House Publishers (DHP) and ChristianCourses.com. RBC Ministries maintains a strict ministry-wide policy that we will never sell, rent, or otherwise give your private information to other organizations, commercial or non-profit. The only exception would be to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of RBC Ministries, our users, or others. Any personally identifiable information (name, address, and/or e-mail address) that you submit to us is used only for the purpose for which it was given.

  2. **Contact Us.** We use the Contact Us forms located on various areas of the site to allow you to contact us directly with any questions, comments, or requests you may have. This information is used to respond to your questions, comments, and requests. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. We do not provide any information to third parties.

  3. **Logged Files and Cookies.** When you log onto the Internet, your ISP automatically assigns an IP address to your computer. Web servers identify your computer by its IP address, and we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our Web site, and to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the Web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

  4. **Information Collected.** When becoming a RBC member, you will provide your e-mail and mailing address. This allows us to send you monthly updates, contact you regarding announcements, system updates, new ministry products and offerings, and other information. RBC may also collect individually identifiable information (such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number) from all who purchase products offered in connection with RBC.org, RBC Ministries, or any of its publishing divisions. The information is used to (a) deliver products and services; (b) analyze and monitor visitor and customer activity; (c) promote and support the products and services offered; (d) help plan the future development of the site and the products and services offered; and (e) develop a knowledge base regarding Web site users and customers.

    1. We have entered into agreements with trusted agents and business members who provide support services and equipment necessary for RBC.org and its ministry associates to provide their products and services. We may share data with these trusted agents and business associates. For example, if you make a purchase from us, the information you provide will be collected by our processing agent, and your credit card information will be provided to our credit card processor so that we can complete the sale. Please do not submit information that you do not wish to have shared.

    2. Occasionally, we may send out surveys. This information will be used entirely by us to improve our products and services.

    3. RBC and DHP are non-profit ministries supported by the gifts of faithful friends and members. We do not send any direct gift solicitations to our members or anyone on our mailing list. However, we maintain the right to change this gift solicitation policy in the future as directed by the RBC Ministries governing board.

  5. **Security.** Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority at RBC.org. We use commercially reasonable means to protect the integrity of its Web site and the confidentiality of collected data. Our employees are aware of our privacy and security policies and your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs. However, we cannot provide absolute assurance against, and will not be liable for, any breaches of confidentiality due to system failures or unauthorized access by third parties.

  6. **Restrictions.** The RBC.org Web site membership is intended for users who are 18 years of age or older. If you are not 18 years of age or older, do not submit any information to us.

  7. **Update User Information**. Reasonable access to personally identifiable information will be provided within 60 days at no cost to the user. If access cannot be provided within that timeframe, we will provide the user a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.

  8. **Links.** The site contains links to other Web sites. We encourage you to visit these Web sites to learn about their privacy policies as theirs may differ from ours. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any Web site you may visit.
