**Utne.com Privacy Policy**

WE PLEDGE NEVER TO ABUSE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS.

  * We will NEVER sell or exchange users' names or email addresses to any other party or organization, without the explicit permission of the user.
  * We provide a service, parts of which are free to end-users, and that is partly supported by sponsorships and advertisers. Sponsor messages and advertising are clearly labeled as such, and are never separate messages.
  * To attract sponsors and advertisers, we may request demographic information from our users that helps us match appropriate advertisements. However, the demographic information will only be distributed to the sponsors in aggregate form. We will NEVER release a user's individually identifiable information.



**IMPORTANT NOTE** : Utne makes its **_print magazine subscriber list_** available to reputable organizations that may interest our readers. If you do not want to receive these mailings, send us your mailing label with instructions.

Utne.com's goal is to provide readers with the information they want and need. To do that, we may gather some general information about those who access our sites. We may place a "cookie" on users' computers, which enable us to determine the user's operating system, browser type and version, Internet Service Provider, top-level domain, and other general information. Users have the ability to configure their browsers to refuse acceptance of cookies, but doing so may render parts of the Utne.com website inoperable for that user. 

**Personal Information**

We will only collect personal identifying information that users voluntarily provide to us in registering for services (such as subscription registration, enewsletter, surveys, and entering contest entry forms. We may use that personal information editorially to improve and customize our content or we may send users occasional promotional messages about Utne's products and services. Users can revoke their consent at any time to stop their information from being used for marketing and promotional purposes by sending an email request to [Michael Fraase](http://www.utne.com/cgi-bin/udt/fdc.collector?client_id=utne&form_id=maileditform&link_id=80), or they can simply opt not to register for special services, surveys, and contests.

Utne.com will limit internal access to user information to employees responsible for conducting business with our customers.

This policy applies only to sites under the utne.com domain. We do not control the privacy policies of Utne.com partner sites, those of our advertisers, or any other sites to which we may link.

**Advertising**

All advertising is published upon the understanding that the advertiser and the agency assume full and complete responsibility and liability for advertising submitted, printed, or published.
