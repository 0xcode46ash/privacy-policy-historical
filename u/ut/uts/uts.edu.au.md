# UTS: Privacy Statement

The purpose of this statement is to let users of this web site know what information is collected about them when they visit this site, how this information is used and if it is disclosed. 

**Recording your visit**

When you look at this web site, we make a record of your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes: 

  * Your server address. 
  * Your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc). 
  * The date and time of your visit to the site. 
  * The pages you accessed and documents downloaded.

  * The type of browser you used. 



No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the University's logs. 

Some sites use "cookies" to track a particular user's access to a site. Cookies are not used on this site to gather personal information about users except when they are used within a specific web-based application for session management purposes. 

**Recording your e-mail address**

We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent. 

**Collecting personal information**

There are some electronic forms on this site that you can use to request more information from the University. When we require you to enter personal information, we will only do so to allow us to respond to your request. 

We will not collect or solicit personal information via this site which would be unlawful, unnecessary or unrelated to the functions or activities of the University, or unfair or unreasonably intrusive. 

**Publishing personal information**

We will only publish personal information on this site if it has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge or if you have consented to the disclosure. When giving such consent you should be aware that information published on this site is accessible to millions of users from all over the world, that it will be indexed by search engines and that it may be copied and used by any web user. This means that, once the information is published on this site, we will have no control over its subsequent use and disclosure.
