# UTS: Privacy Statement

The purpose of the UTS Privacy Statement is to let visitors to the UTSWeb know what information is collected about them when they visit, how the information is used, and whether or not it is disclosed. 

As a public sector agency, the University comes under the [Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/papipa1998464/) and the [Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hraipa2002370/). As part of the University's commitment to the management of personal information, the University has developed a Privacy Management Plan which is currently under review. The University also has a [Policy on the Management and Protection of Student Information](http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/policies/studentinfo-policy.html). Further advice is available on [Privacy at UTS](http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/privacy/index.html).

**Recording your visit**

When you visit the UTSWeb, UTS makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes only: 

  * Your server address. 
  * Your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc). 
  * The date and time of your visit to the site. 
  * The pages you accessed and documents downloaded. 
  * The previous site you visited. 
  * The type of browser you used. 



No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the University's logs. 

Some sites use 'cookies' to track a particular user's access to a site. Cookies are not used on this site to gather personal information about users except when they are used within a specific web-based application for session management purposes. 

**Recording your email address**

Your email address is only recorded by UTS when you send the University a message, and it will only be used for the purpose for which you provided it. UTS will not use your email address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it or add it to a mailing list without your consent. 

**Collecting personal information on the UTSWeb**

Some parts of the UTSWeb provide electronic forms that allow you to request particular information from the University. Personal information is only requested in order for UTS to respond to your inquiry. 

We will not collect or solicit personal information via this site which would be unlawful, unnecessary or unrelated to the functions or activities of the University, or unfair or unreasonably intrusive. 

Where particular personal information is requested, the request will be accompanied by a specific privacy statement that indicates the purpose of the collection and how the information will be managed and used. 

**Publishing personal information on the UTSWeb**

UTS will only publish personal information on the UTSWeb if it has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge, or if you have consented to the disclosure. When giving such consent you should be aware that information published on the UTSWeb is accessible to millions of users world-wide, that it will be indexed by search engines, and that it may be copied and used by any web user. This means that once information is published on the UTSWeb, UTS has no control over its subsequent use and disclosure. 

If you wish to have personal information about you removed from the UTSWeb, contact the [UTS Privacy Officer](http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/privacy/help-advice.html).
