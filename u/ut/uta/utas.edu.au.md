This statement explains the type of information collected from users of University of Tasmania (UTAS) websites, and how that information is used and disclosed. UTAS respects personal privacy and is bound by the _Personal Information Protection Act 2004 (Tas)_. More information on how UTAS collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information can be found in the University’s [Privacy Policy](http://www.utas.edu.au/policy/alpha.html).

When you visit a UTAS website, the web server automatically records your visit and logs the following information:

  * the browser’s internet address
  * the user’s domain name
  * the date and time of the visit
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded
  * the previous site visited
  * the type of browser used.



UTAS websites do not generally use cookies, although some specific applications and services do.

This information is collected for internal use by UTAS for marketing, audit, statistical and security purposes, as well as to provide and improve its website services. UTAS may, for example, use the information to determine main visitor locations and interests for marketing purposes; inform website development and design; identify compatibility issues; or to identify and pursue misuse of its website services.

Any personal information collected through this process will not be disclosed outside UTAS unless required or permitted by law.

This statement applies only to general website browsing. Additional authenticated websites and services (such as blogs and online teaching areas) may be available to UTAS staff and students and certain other users. Personal information you enter in accessing and using these services may also be collected and may become publicly accessible information. Use of these services is subject to applicable UTAS policy and any service-specific privacy statements and conditions.

You have the right to access your personal information held by UTAS in accordance with the _Freedom of Information Act 1991 (Tas)._
