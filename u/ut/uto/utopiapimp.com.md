**Privacy Policy for Utopiapimp.com**

 _Personal/User information_

Your personal information (email address, etc.) and user account information will never be given out to third parties. Your email will only be used to send you confirmation information about your registration at utopiapimp.com as well as instructions if you ever choose to reset your password. Additionally, I (the administrator and creator of Utopiapimp.com) might contact you via email if a previous arrangement to do so has been established, or if I need to deliver time-sensitive information to you (such as details about moving to Utopiapimp.com's beta-testing server).

Your user information cannot be seen by anyone else, including your kingdom mates. This includes user settings, your username, as well as what other kingdoms your user account may be associated with. 

_Kingdom intelligence/information_

A kingdom's repository of information and intelligence can only be viewed by that kingdom, and cannot be viewed from anywhere else. Furthermore, the monarch of that kingdom can grant access to kingdom information on a per user basis, so only the users chosen by the monarch can have access to kingdom info. This is done as a security measure to allow a reasonable amount of control over new provinces and defectors/defectee's access to kingdom intelligence.

I will never access a kingdom's information unless that kingdom has reported a bug or issue with a feature of Utopiapimp.com. In that case, only information pertinent to the bug/problem is looked at, and everything else is ignored.

A kingdom's and its users' information may be used for anonymous statistics gathering. This is an opt-in procedure, so no users or kingdoms are included in this process by default. A full and updated list of how this information is used can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050414141554id_/http%3A//utopiapimp.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Dmisc/index.php?page=misc/manual&manpage=stats). In summary, though, these statistics will only be used to either provide additional functionality to Utopiapimp.com users or to provide anonymous, aggregated details of activity trends. The only exception to this policy is the number of kingdoms currently using Utopiapimp, which is listed on the front news page.

A kingdom's identity will not be exposed to any third parties. There is no evidence outside of a kingdom's account that details whether or not a kingdom uses the Utopiapimp, unless stated by a member of the kingdom in areas such as the public forums.

_Cookies_

Web-browser cookies are used on the site for two purposes. The first is to allow a customized experience within the Utopiapimp.com by remembering which account you are currently logged in to. The second use is an optional one: auto-login. If chosen, this cookie will contain data which will allow your browser to automatically log itself into the Utopiapimp.

_Website statistics_

There are only two types of statistics gathered by the website. The first set are summaries of website traffic and activity that are automatically generated by statistics packages that often come with web hosting accounts. The website will occasionally turn on timing statistic, which will measure how fast webpages are generated; this is done in order to pinpoint slow pages and provide a faster experience to the user. Both of these sets of statistics are only availabe to myself, and no one else.

_Contacts_

You are more than welcome to contact me if you have any questions about this privacy policy or about anything else on the website. I can be reached via the quick feedback system located on the bottom of this web page. If you prefer instant messenger, I am on aim (molesquirrel), icq (12184913), or msn (msn@molesquirrel.net). Lastly, I have a small irc channel (#utopiapimp) on the irc server irc.utonet.org .
