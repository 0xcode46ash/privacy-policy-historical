# UTC | Privacy Statement

We know that your privacy is very important to you. When you place orders on our site, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to the UTC WEBSITE. We will collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail or those who create accounts on the UTC WEBSITE. We also collect aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The administrators of the UTC WEBSITE are making every effort to minimize and safeguard the personal information associated with each user account that resides on the system. Only the user's Name, City/Town, State and Country will be displayed to other users. 

Those using the system should be careful to do nothing that might compromise the privacy of users. All information posted within the UTC WEBSITE should conform to the University of Tennessee's Privacy of Student Records Policy at: <http://www.utc.edu/Administration/Records/ferpa.php>.
