The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) respects your privacy. The University's main web page does not collect personal information about visitors. In particular, we do not use "cookies" to collect information.

Personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means will be used only for purposes necessary to serve your needs.

The service may involve redirecting your inquiry, information or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs. 

We may use server logs to collect information concerning your Internet connection and general information about your visit to our Web site. This information may be used to analyze trends; to create summary statistics for the purpose of determining technical design specifications; and to identify system performance or problem areas.

Some web pages at UTD may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each web page that collects information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you how that information is used.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your use of this Web site, please contact the [Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@utdallas.edu).
