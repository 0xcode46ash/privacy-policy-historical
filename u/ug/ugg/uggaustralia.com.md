Privacy

Deckers Outdoor Corporation Privacy Policy

The Deckers Outdoor family of product lines (UGG Australia, Teva and Simple Shoes) and accompanying websites (uggaustralia.com, teva.com and simpleshoes.com) takes the protection and proper use of your personal information seriously. We respect your privacy, and take great care to safeguard information in our possession. Your preferences for use of your information are our highest priority. 

### What personal information about our customers does Deckers Outdoor gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Deckers Outdoor websites. Here are the types of information we gather:

  * Information you give us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide voluntary information. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our websites, and communicating with you. 

  * Automatic information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses a Deckers Outdoor website. We use this information to remember you once you have logged into your account and to remember your shopping cart. No personally identifiable information is stored in the cookie. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Deckers Outdoor websites if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. 

  * E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive notice of your activity within an e-mail from Deckers Outdoor if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please log-in to your account to change your preferences, or call us at 1-888-432-8530.

  * Information from other sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.




### Does Deckers Outdoor share the information it receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We share customer information only as described below. 

  * Agents: We employ other firms to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are contractually obligated to protect personal information.

  * Protection of Deckers Outdoor and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Deckers Outdoor, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 

  * With your consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 




### How secure is information about me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account, password and to your computer. Be sure to log out of your account when finished using a shared computer. 

### Which information can I access?

Deckers Outdoor gives you access to information about your account and your interactions with Deckers Outdoor for the purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. You may log-in to your account or call us at 1-866-896-3708 to update personal information or change preferences. 

### What choices do I have?

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of promotional offers. 

  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please change your preferences by logging into your account, or calling us at 1-888-432-8530. 

  * Our California customers, in accordance with California Civil Code Section 1798.83, may request certain information regarding our disclosures, if any, of personally identifiable information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please call us at 1-888-432-8530. We will attempt to provide you with the requested information within 30 days of receiving your request.

  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to experience the full functionality of Deckers Outdoorâ€™s family of websites.

  * Click here to explore products that offer anonymous browsing. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet. 




### Children

Deckers Outdoor does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may shop at Deckers Outdoor websites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions 

If you choose to visit Deckers Outdoor, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the states of Arizona and California. If you have any concern about privacy at Deckers Outdoor, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
