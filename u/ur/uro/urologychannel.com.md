## Personal Information Remedy Health Media Collects From You

If you are receiving Remedy Health Media publications and promotional messages via postal or e-mail, this is due to your having registered to receive such messages online or to your having returned a business reply card to Remedy Health Media upon which you included certain Personal Information and indicated your interest in receiving such communications. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean information that can be used to identify you, including, but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address; (d) a telephone number; (e) age/birth date; or (f) personal health information. Remedy Health Media collects Personal Information from you through online registration, business reply cards and online surveys and questionnaires that you submit. 

This Website makes forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users (collectively, "Additional Services"). Please remember that any information that you may post in these Additional Services becomes public information when you post it and the use thereof is not within our control. Please exercise caution and discretion when posting Personal Information in these Additional Services.

A user may be required to submit his/her name and e-mail address to post a question in the Additional Services. This information is not used by Remedy Health Media, unless the user registers for an Additional Service, in which case the Personal Information submitted shall be retained in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Passwords are retained only when a user registers for an Additional Service. Each Additional Service may have additional terms applicable to the use thereof ("Additional Terms") and by registering for or participating in such service, you agree to be bound by such Additional Terms.

All users of the Website are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we have the right to refuse or revoke your right to use our Website and/or reject and delete any entry you make, if we have reason to believe information you provide to us is or may be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

We attempt to reply promptly to these requests and may, in our discretion, file comments submitted to improve the Website and any Additional Services, or review and discard the information. 

## How Remedy Health Media Uses Personal Information

Remedy Health Media may use your Personal Information to send postal and/or e-mail communications to you, including communications sent on behalf of its advertisers and other partners. If you indicated your interest in receiving health or medical information from third parties, then Remedy Health Media may share your Personal Information with such third parties. Remedy Health Media does not share your Personal Information with any third parties other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy. Remedy Health Media may use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as performing market analysis and analyzing and managing its business.

Remedy Health Media may provide subscriber subscriber information in aggregate, de-identified form (i.e., in a manner that the data cannot be traced back to you) to its advertisers and other parties. Remedy Health Media at times may share Personal Information (name and physical address) with third parties for marketing and fundraising purposes.

Remedy Health Media may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Information where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process (for example, Remedy Health Media may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), to protect the security or integrity of its databases or the Website, to protect Remedy Health Media's business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition (see below), to protect and defend the rights or property of Remedy Health Media, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to your use of the Website.

Remedy Health Media may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on its behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, information technology support, maintaining and removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on Remedy Health Media's behalf shall have access to its usersâ€™ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for Remedy Health Media but are not permitted to use your Personal Information for other purposes. All Remedy Health Media contractors operate under federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy.

The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at the Website, Remedy Health Media assigns an identification number to that e-mail address and deploys a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to the Website using the same PC, the cookie allows the Website to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on the Website (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), Remedy Health Media may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in its user database. Remedy Health Media may use the Personal Information stored in its database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Website; and/or (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user.

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a website. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Remedy Health Media may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Website and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Remedy Health Media reserves the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely. Remedy Health Media at times links the data collected through the means described in this paragraph with your Personal Information for purposes of customizing messages to you and customizing Website content for you. At no time will Remedy Health Media share cookie-related, action-tag-related and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.
