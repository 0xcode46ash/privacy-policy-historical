###  Safe and Secure Shopping

##  Is it safe to use my credit card? 

Yes, shopping at uRead.com is 100% safe. Credit card payments are processed through the Axis Bank (formerly UTI Bank) payment gateway. Axis Bank is one of the biggest and most trusted banks in India. Internet Banking and other payments are processed by CCAvenue. We are also adding other payment gateways like PayPal which are the most secured gateways globally. Axis Bank uses the latest encryption technology to protect your credit card information. It encrypts your credit card number so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. Furthermore, Axis Bank also asks you to enter the CVV (Credit Verification Value) number on your credit card. This is a 3 digit number which follows your credit card number and is given at the back of the card to ensure that the person entering the card number has the physical plastic card with him/her. You can be assured that uRead.com offers you the highest standards of security currently available on the Net so as to ensure that your shopping experience is private, safe and secure. 

##  Does uRead.com store my credit card information?

URead.com does not collect or store your credit card/bank account information at all. Axis Bank/CCAvenue authorizes the transaction directly without any information passing through us.
