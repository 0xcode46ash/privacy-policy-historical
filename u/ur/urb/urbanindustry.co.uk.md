This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site:

###  1\. What information does Urbanindustry.co.uk collect from you?

Urbanindustry.co.uk collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customised experience while using our site.

###  Personally Identifiable Information

This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, enter contests, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, delivery address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, Urban Industry can fulfil your orders and provide you with personalised service.

###  Non-Personally Identifiable Information

This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

###  2\. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Urban Industry's visitors with a superior customised online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.

Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the postcode and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Urbanindustry.co.uk visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. Urban Industry also completes research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customise our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or a web site analysis agent that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.

###  3\. We gather information in the following ways:

###  Shopping

We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site, to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect information from visitors to our site regarding the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com or .co.uk), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit or order, the number of visits and orders, the number of visits per browsing session, the server type, the operating system and browser type used to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms entered on our site.

###  Ordering

When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.

###  Contests

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available. You consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information as a condition of your participation.

###  Newsletters & Promotional E-mails

We may offer free newsletters, and promotional e-mails as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current promotions and deals. To unsubscribe from Urban Industry emails please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every Urban Industry email.

###  Contact Information

If you contact Urbanindustry.co.uk or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, e-mail address and order information in order to send you a reply.

###  Cookies

We use cookies in the operation of our website which can be deleted by accessing your internet options. Please see our section on Urbanindustry.co.uk's use of cookies for more information.

###  4\. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information

We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us. During the online ordering process you can review, change, or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you should not expect that all of your Personally Identifiable Information will be completely removed from our backed-up databases.

###  5\. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information

Email: We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials and new additions to the Urban Industry.com site. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to info@urbanindustry.co.uk. After doing so, Urbanindustry.co.uk users will not receive future promotional emails unless they open a new account, enter a contest, or sign up to receive newsletters or emails.

###  6\. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information.

When you access your account information, the information is kept on a secure server and data is encrypted. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorised access by physical security means.

###  7\. Privacy Policy changes

If Urbanindustry.co.uk makes changes to any terms or conditions in the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and to whom we will disclose it. We may change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at any time, and any changes will become effective immediately.
