[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.urbanthreads.com&sealid=101)  
  
---  
  
**Urban Threads** has created this privacy statement to demonstrate my commitment to your privacy, and my pledge to keep your personal information secure. The following is information that **Urban Threads** gathers and uses:  
   
  
**TrustE**

**Urban Threads** is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site [http://www.UrbanThreads.com](http://www.urbanthreads.com/). Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact  
Niamh at [support@UrbanThreads.com](mailto:support@UrbanThreads.com) (or use the [online Contact Urban Threads form](http://www.urbanthreads.com/form_contact) at [www.UrbanThreads.com](http://www.urbanthreads.com/)). 

If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php> TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with **Urban Threads** to resolve your concerns.

**Registration**

**Urban Threads** requires that shoppers register with a real email address, name, and original password chosen by you. The email address is required so that I can contact you about designs that you have purchased. The name is required to avoid any potential confusion with payment. A password is necessary for shoppers to access the products that they've purchased, and use the unique and persona parts of my site, such as the basket, list of faves, and past purchases.

Shoppers at **Urban Threads** are assured that their email address, name, and password is never shared with any third party. I keep your information private and secure, and it is not shared, sold, exchanged, or traded with anyone else.

After registration, shoppers will receive a confirmation email with their email address and password that they can keep for their records.

**Cookies**

**Urban Threads** uses cookies to keep track of how shoppers use the website. This information is used for website improvements. The cookies are removed from your computer when you sign out of **Urban Threads**. 

If your web browser is set to not accept cookies, you may still browse through the website, use all areas of the site, and purchase products.

**Urban Threads** uses persistent cookies for shoppers' convenience. These persistent cookies are tied to personally identifiable information. If a shopper's web browser allows persistent cookies, the shopper will be automatically signed into the site at every visit.  
  
**Third-Party Cookies**

A session cookie from [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) (the issuer of **Urban Threads's** security certificate) is used on pages that display the seal of authenticity. The cookie does not collect any information, and is used to aid in displaying **Urban Threads's** validation page when shoppers click on the seal.  
  
**IP Address**

**Urban Threads** has the ability to track and record IP addresses. This information is not shared or given to any third party. It's used to help diagnose problems with my server, and to administer the website. I run reports that show how many visitors come to my site each day, and from which part of the world. The information that's gathered gives me a good idea of which web browsers are most popular, and which parts of the world my visitors are coming from.

No personal information (name or email address) links any visitor to any IP address. All the data that is gathered by tracking IP addresses is used for the sole purpose of improving my website and products, and is not shared with anyone else.  
  
**Promotional Mailings and Newsletters**

Email newsletters are sent every Friday with information about new designs and projects. 

All shoppers can choose not to receive weekly updates by filling out the Contact Urban Threads form at the website, or by replying to one of the promotional emails and requesting to be removed from the promotional emails.  
  
**Ordering**

**Urban Threads** uses a shopping basket/order form for shoppers to purchase products. The site collects billing and financial information (credit card numbers and security codes). Financial information that is collected is used only to bill the shopper for the products requested. This information is used only for that purpose, and is never shared with any other person or company. No credit card information is stored in your profile or in any other area of the site.

We use a secure third party to process credit cards. No credit card information is stored for any use other than processing the transactions. 

If a shopper wishes to purchase a gift certificate for someone else, I'll ask for the name and email address of the person getting the certificate. This information is used to send an email to the person to notify them of the certificate code.  
  
**Links**

**Urban Threads** contains links to other websites. **Urban Threads** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the other websites. As privacy practices may vary at other sites, please review each site's privacy statement.

  
   
  
**Security**

**Urban Threads** has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alternation of your personal information under our control. The security certificate is provided by [GoDaddy](https://seal.godaddy.com/verifySeal?sealID=201954842703dfa46b41011f6e8536b957ce3942843567420). There is a seal of authenticity at **Urban Threads** and the purchasing page. Click on the seals for information about the security certificate.
