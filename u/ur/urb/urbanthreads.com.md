# Embroidery Designs at Urban Threads - Privacy Policy

**UrbanThreads.com** has created this privacy statement to demonstrate my commitment to your privacy, and my pledge to keep your personal information secure. The following is information that **UrbanThreads.com** gathers and uses:  
   
---  
**Registration**

**UrbanThreads.com** requires that shoppers register with a real email address, name, and original password chosen by you. The email address is required so that I can contact you about designs that you have purchased. The name is required to avoid any potential confusion with payment. A password is necessary for shoppers to access the products that they've purchased, and use the unique and persona parts of my site, such as the basket, list of faves, and past purchases.

Shoppers at **UrbanThreads.com** are assured that their email address, name, and password is never shared with any third party. I keep your information private and secure, and it is not shared, sold, exchanged, or traded with anyone else.

After registration, shoppers will receive a confirmation email with their email address and password that they can keep for their records. 

  
   
**Cookies**

**UrbanThreads.com** uses cookies to keep track of how shoppers use the website. This information is used for website improvements. The cookies are removed from your computer when you sign out of **UrbanThreads.com**. 

If your web browser is set to not accept cookies, you may still browse through the website, use all areas of the site, and purchase products.

**UrbanThreads.com** uses persistent cookies for shoppers' convenience. These persistent cookies are tied to personally identifiable information. If a shopper's web browser allows persistent cookies, the shopper will be automatically signed into the site at every visit.  
  
**Third-Party Cookies**

A session cookie from 

[_Authorize.net_](http://www.authorize.net/) (the issuer of **UrbanThreads.com's** security certificate) is used on pages that display the seal of authenticity. The cookie does not collect any information, and is used to aid in displaying **UrbanThreads.com's** validation page when shoppers click on the seal.  
   
**IP Address**

**UrbanThreads.com** has the ability to track and record IP addresses. This information is not shared or given to any third party. It's used to help diagnose problems with my server, and to administer the website. I run reports that show how many visitors come to my site each day, and from which part of the world. The information that's gathered gives me a good idea of which web browsers are most popular, and which parts of the world my visitors are coming from.

No personal information (name or email address) links any visitor to any IP address. All the data that is gathered by tracking IP addresses is used for the sole purpose of improving my website and products, and is not shared with anyone else.  
  
**Promotional Mailings and Newsletters**

Email newsletters are sent every Friday with information about new designs and projects. 

All shoppers can choose not to receive weekly updates by filling out the Contact Me form at the website, or by replying to one of the promotional emails and requesting to be removed from the promotional emails.  
  
**Ordering**

**UrbanThreads.com** uses a shopping basket/order form for shoppers to purchase products. The site collects billing and financial information (credit card numbers and security codes). Financial information that is collected is used only to bill the shopper for the products requested. This information is used only for that purpose, and is never shared with any other person or company. No credit card information is stored in your profile or in any other area of the site.

We use a third party (

[ _Authorize.net_](http://www.authorize.net/)) to process credit cards. No credit card information is stored for any use other than processing the transactions.

If a shopper wishes to purchase a gift certificate for someone else, I'll ask for the name and email address of the person getting the certificate. This information is used to send an email to the person to notify them of the certificate code.
