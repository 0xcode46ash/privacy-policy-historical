   **The Fair Information Principles**

Our Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy legislation in Canada. It incorporates the following 10 principles:  


  * Collecting your personal information - Urban Barn only collects information necessary to conduct its business, including marketing and promoting its products, as well as understanding your interests and preferences to serve you better.
  * Accountability - Urban Barn is responsible for maintaining and protecting your personal information under its control. Accountability for this function is with the Director, Sales and Store Operations and the Marketing Manager.
  * Identifying Purpose - Urban Barn will let you know the purpose for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.
  * Consent – Your knowledge and consent are required before Urban Barn is allowed to collect, use or disclose your personal information. Where possible, Urban Barn will obtain consent directly from you at the time of collection. After having provided consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time by providing reasonable notice to the Marketing Manager. If you wish to stop receiving email marketing communication from Urban Barn you can simply hit the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our emails at any point in time.

  * Accuracy of Personal Information - Personal information is kept as accurate, complete and up to date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. You are encouraged to provide updates to your personal information as changes occur.
  * Safeguarding Personal Information - Your personal information, whatever its form, will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. The safeguards will protect your personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. The measures of protection include:
  * Physical measures, for example, locking filing cabinets and restricted access to offices;
  * Organizational measures, for example, security passes and limiting access to the personal information on a “need-to-know” basis; 
  * Technological measures, for example, the use of passwords and encryption; and
  * Procedural measures, for example, the shredding of sensitive personal information.
  * Access to Personal Information - You may request a copy of your personal information held at Urban Barn by submitting a written request to the Marketing Manager at our head office (please refer to our website for the address). Acceptable proof of identification is required before such information is given out. The Marketing Manager will respond to your request within 30 days. If you feel the information we have about you is inaccurate, you may request that it be reviewed and, if inaccurate, changed, by contacting the Marketing Manager.
  * Challenging Compliance - An individual can challenge compliance with the above policy by providing written details of the challenge to the Marketing Manager.
