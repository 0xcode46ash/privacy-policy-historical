When we use service providers, we use contractual means to help ensure your personal information remains secure in a manner consistent with this policy and applicable laws. If you do not wish us to provide your personal information to a service provider you can advise us, however, we may not be able to provide you with an associated service or product. 

In some cases, we may be permitted or required by law to disclose personal information.
