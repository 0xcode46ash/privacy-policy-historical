Privacy Policy
Urban Barn has created this privacy statement because we are committed to respecting your
privacy. We recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of all personally
identifiable information that our customers share with us.
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices that apply to
information collected on our website (www.urbanbarn.com), from purchases, and in our stores.
Collecting Your Personal Information
When you visit one of our stores to make a purchase, or if you participate in a contest, promotion
or survey, we may collect information from you, such as your name, email and postal addresses,
and phone and credit card numbers.
There may be times, such as when you subscribe to our email newsletter, whether online or in
person, at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name,
telephone number, email address, gender, occupation, personal interests, etc. Whether or not to
provide such information is completely your own choice.
We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit our web site, and analyze this
data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous.
Using Your Personal Information
We use personal information, such as a purchaser's name, email address, postal address,
telephone number and credit card information, to fulfill merchandise orders. We may also use
order information to contact a purchaser when necessary, such as when a delivery may be
delayed or when an ordered product is out of stock.
We use the personally identifiable information you provide for internal purposes, such as
confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics,
informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from
Urban Barn.
We will only disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it.
Links to Other Web Sites
Our web site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties, over which
we have no control. Privacy policies on linked sites may be different from our privacy policy. You
access such linked sites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked
site before disclosing your personal information to any of these sites.
Policy Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a
notice on our web site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The
new policy will apply to all current and past users of our web site and will replace any prior
policies that are inconsistent. This policy was posted in July 2005.
