Social media resources include, but are not limited to, social networks, discussion boards, bulletin boards, blogs, wikis, and referral functions to share web site content and tools with a friend or colleague. 

Urban Airship may collect Personal Information to enable individuals to use online social media resources offered either by Urban Airship or a Third Party. We may also enable you to use these social media resources to post or share Personal Information with others. When using social media resources, you should take into careful consideration what Personal Information you share with others. 

If you use on online social media resource offered by a Third Party ("Third Party SMR") through the Services, you acknowledge that Urban Airship may be able to access any information you make public through such Third Party SMR (such as your username, comments, posts and contacts) and other information your privacy settings on such Third Party SMR permit Urban Airship to access. Urban Airship will comply with the terms of this Privacy Statement and the privacy policies applicable to the social media resources it uses. 

####  Direct Mail and Email Marketing 

Individuals who provide us with Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from Third Parties, may receive periodic emails, newsletters or mailings from us with information on Urban Airship or our business partners' products and Services or upcoming special offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer the option to decline these communications at no cost to the individual by following the instructions in Section 3 below. 

####  All Internet Users - Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, and Interest-Based Advertising 

#####  Cookies 

Like many other websites, Urban Airship or its business partners may employ a cookie, or small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to "identify" visitors, each time an Individual initiates a session on the Company's Sites. A cookie is set in order to identify visitors; tailor our Sites to you; measure and research the effectiveness of our Sites' features, offerings and advertisements; and authenticate users for registered Services. Cookies can only access Personal Information that you have provided on our Sites and cannot be accessed by other sites. Individuals also have the ability to delete cookie files from their own hard drive at any time by clicking on the Privacy or History tab typically found on the Settings or Options menu in your internet browser. However, please also be advised that cookies may be necessary to provide access to much of the content and many of the features of Urban Airship's Sites. 

#####  Pixel Tags/Web Beacons 

Urban Airship may use "pixel tags," also known as "web beacons," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the browser type and language; the device type; geographic location; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we or our Third Party-service providers may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email. 

#####  Analytics Information 

We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Sites, and to develop website content. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit [ www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ ](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) . You can opt out of Google's collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to [ http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout ](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) . 

#####  Interest-Based Advertising 

Through our Sites, Urban Airship may in the future allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect anonymous, non-Personal Information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Urban Airship related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." 

####  Mobile Devices 

Urban Airship may provide websites, applications and online resources that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Urban Airship will collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use such websites, applications or online resources, like a device identifier, location, user settings and the operating system of your device. 

Mobile versions of Urban Airship's Sites may require that users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of the website may be associated with user accounts. In addition, Urban Airship may enable Individuals to download an application, widget or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Urban Airship to enable you to access user accounts and to enable Urban Airship to track use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool. Urban Airship may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to the Company to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement or in other notices Urban Airship provides. 

####  Anonymous and Aggregated Information 

Urban Airship may use your Personal Information and other information about you to create anonymized and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Sites or other online Services, or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors' interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Urban Airship may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Urban Airship and with Third Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you. 

###  Choice/Modalities to Opt Out 

You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Statement. 

####  General 

Where you have consented to Urban Airship's Processing of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by following the instructions in this Section 3. Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out. Note that, due to the nature of the Services, you may have to provide the email or other identifying value that is associated with your Personal Information in order for Urban Airship to segregate out the use and retention of such Personal Information. 

Prior to disclosing Sensitive Data to a Third Party or Processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual, Urban Airship will endeavor to obtain each individual's explicit consent (opt-in). Where consent of the individual for the Processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, Urban Airship will comply with the law or contract. 

####  Email Communications 

An "Unsubscribe" button will be provided at the top or bottom of each email communications sent by Urban Airship so that you can opt-out. However, we may continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or Services you have requested in response to such request. We may need to send you certain communications regarding the Urban Airship programs and Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications - e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Statement. 

####  "Do Not Track" 

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Urban Airship should interpret DNT signals. Therefore, Urban Airship does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device. For information about "do-not-track", visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/). 

###  Onward Transfer 

####  Information We Share 

Urban Airship does not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement or as you explicitly consent. Urban Airship endeavors to require third parties to which it discloses Personal Information to protect Personal Information using substantially-similar standards to those required by Urban Airship (and at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles and this Privacy Statement). 

#####  Service Providers 

Urban Airship may share Personal Information with our service providers that we have retained to perform Services on our behalf including (i) provision of IT and related Services; (ii) provision of information and Services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; and (iv) customer service activities. Payment information will be used and shared only to effectuate your order and may be stored by a service provider for purposes of future orders. 

Urban Airship has executed appropriate contracts with our service providers that prohibit service providers from using or sharing your personal information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements. 

#####  Business Partners 

From time to time, Urban Airship may partner with other companies to jointly offer products, services or programs (such as webinars, events or downloadable content). If you purchase, specifically express interest in or register for a jointly-offered product, service or program from or through Urban Airship, the Company may share your Personal Information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our business partners. Urban Airship does not control our business partners' use of shared Personal Information and their use of such information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service. 

#####  Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others 

We may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, court order or legal process; (ii) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (iii) under the discovery process in litigation; (iv) to enforce Urban Airship policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Urban Airship; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. 

In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes - e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities. 

#####  Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions 

We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Should such an event occur, Urban Airship will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. 

#####  International Transfers 

Urban Airship primarily stores Personal Information sent or collected via or by Urban Airship in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. To facilitate the Company's global operations, the Company may transfer, store and access such information from around the world. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Urban Airship, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations. 

#####  Data Protection Addendum 

While the data protection, privacy and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy, including offering a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) to our agreement. 

#####  Privacy Shield Framework 

Urban Airship complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Urban Airship has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Urban Airship commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Urban Airship at: privacy@urbanairship.com 

If your Personal Information was received in reliance on either Privacy Shield Framework and you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider JAMS, at no cost to you, at [ https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield ](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield) .

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Urban Airship is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

###  Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure and Restriction 

####  Your Personal Information 

You may seek confirmation regarding whether Urban Airship is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or has been Processed in violation of applicable data protection laws. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may use the email address set forth in Section 8 of this Privacy Statement to request access to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Urban Airship. Such requests will be Processed in accordance with local laws. Although Urban Airship makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Urban Airship is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others' privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual's privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Urban Airship determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Urban Airship will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information. 

####  Customer Data 

As a data processor for our Customers, Urban Airship Processes data that may include Personal Information of Users ("Customer Data"). Urban Airship will not review, share, distribute or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the agreements between us and our Customers, or as may be required by law. If Personal Information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us by a Customer as Customer Data and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Customer directly. Because Urban Airship personnel have limited ability to access Customer Data, if you wish to make your request directly to Urban Airship, please provide the name of the relevant Urban Airship customer. We will refer your request to that Customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

###  Security 

The security of all Personal Information provided to Urban Airship is important to us, and Urban Airship takes reasonable steps designed to protect your Personal Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Urban Airship strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to Urban Airship.

Urban Airship does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16).

If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16) in relation to the Services, we will promptly delete that information. 

####  California Privacy Rights 

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the Third Parties to whom we have disclosed their Personal Information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of Personal Information disclosed to those parties. Urban Airship does not share Personal Information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.

Urban Airship encourages you to review the privacy policy of any company, website or digital property before submitting your Personal Information. Some Third Parties may choose to share their users' Personal Information with Urban Airship; that sharing is governed by that company's privacy policy, not this Privacy Statement.
