# Privacy & Security for UrbanDecay.com

Welcome to **www.Urban Decay.com** (the " **Site** "), a website operated by the Urban Decay Cosmetics, LLC (" **Urban Decay** ", " **we** ", " **us** ", or " **our** "). We provide our users (collectively, " **you** " or " **your** ") with an e-commerce marketplace to learn more about and purchase our products, as well as a number of related services (collectively, the " **Services** "). We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site or whether you making a purchase.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase " **Personal Information** " in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase " **Anonymous Information** " in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

**Children**  
The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. When the Site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services. Additionally, if you are under 18, you may not purchase any products from the Site.

**How We Collect Information**  
**Personal Information**  
In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to process your orders, to provide the Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you register or order products. To create an " **Account** " with a user name, we require that you provide certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. We may also ask you to provide certain optional Personal Information, such as your age and gender, to help us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services.

One type of Personal Information we may collect when you purchase products through the Site (regardless of whether you have an Account) is " **Payment Information** ", which means the information necessary to process your order. Payment Information may include the following: (i) your name as it appears on the credit card, (ii) the credit card type (VISA, MasterCard, American Express or any other issuer then accepted by Urban Decay), (iii) a valid credit card number; (iv) the date of expiration of your credit card, (v) your billing address, and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card. However, we offer alternative means of paying for orders such as PayPal, through which Urban Decay will not collect any Payment Information from you. Either way, we will also need to collect your shipping address to process any order.

If you have an Account, we will store your Payment Information, unless you request us not to do so (for information about making this request, please see the section below regarding deleting and changing your information). If you do not have an Account, when you purchase products with your credit card, we collect your Payment Information to process that transaction (but only temporarily â€“ we do not store your information longer than is necessary for us to process the transaction).

To receive our newsletter, you must provide your email address. When you communicate with us through our Site or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services you are able to use.

If a third party buys you an e-GiftCard to our Site, we will ask for your email address from the party paying for your e-GiftCard. If you do not wish for us to collect or hold information about you that you did not provide to us, please see the section below regarding deleting and changing your information. If you are the party buying an e-GiftCard, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any Payment Information necessary to process that order (unless you opt to pay with PayPal).
