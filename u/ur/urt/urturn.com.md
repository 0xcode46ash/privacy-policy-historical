  2. urTurn's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you share with us, and to help you make informed decisions when participating in the urTurn Application.  Even so, as urTurn grows and technologies change, so will our policies.  If you have comments or suggestions as to urTurn’s Privacy Policies you may send the same to contact@urTurn.com.
  3. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the Privacy Policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice within the urTurn Application. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your User account. 



**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CONTENT** | Back to top

  1. The Information We Collect. When you install and participate in the urTurn Application, we request or are provided access to various types of your personal information. 

a. We are provided with personal information that you knowingly disclosed to the host web platform (i.e. Facebook, Myspace (coming soon), etc.), which may include your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended, and any other personal or preference information provided to the hose web platform; 

b. When you install any urTurn App, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Users. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about you. We use session ID cookies to confirm that Users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the User closes the browser; 

c. When you participate in any urTurn Application or any urTurn Auction, information, such as bids placed, Auction Items bid upon, winning bid amounts, and other transaction details are collected and stored by us; 

d. urTurn may also collect information about you from outside sources such as newspapers, blogs,  and other users of the Program ("Public Information") (information described in 1(a)-(d) above is collectively "User Information"); 

  2. Use of Content and Information. By participating in the urTurn Application, you consent to have your User Information Content transferred to and processed in the United States, and used in the following manner: 

a. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature; 

b. We may occasionally use your User Information to send you notifications regarding new services offered by urTurn that we think you may find valuable. 

c. We may send you urTurn-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the urTurn Application. You will usually be given the opportunity to opt out of such emails by a link contained in the e-mail, however, urTurn reserves the right to send you notices about your User account even if you opt out of email notifications. 

d. We may use your User Information without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating statistics regarding the users of urTurn and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you the urTurn Application.  We may also use this data for research and educational purposes.  

e. We may use Public Information to make the urTurn Application more beneficial and customized to you.

f. Generally we do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission, unless such marketers are partners or affiliated with urTurn. Otherwise, we share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the urTurn Application, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example, we may provide User Information to service providers to help us bring you the urTurn Application. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as in redemption fulfillment, to send out email updates about urTurn, to remove repetitive information from our User lists, or to process payments for products or services and UrPoints transfers. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your User Information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we will implement reasonable contractual protections limiting the use of that information to the urTurn specified purposes. 

g. We may be required to disclose User Information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the urTurn Application or using the urTurn name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. 

h. We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other urTurn Application offers. We may offer or provide services jointly with other companies on urTurn. You can tell when another company is involved in a service provided on urTurn, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that service. 

i. If the ownership of all or substantially all of urTurn were to change, your User Information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your User Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy. 




**LINKS** | Back to top

The urTurn Application may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave any urTurn Application to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by urTurn. 

**THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS** | Back to top

Advertisements that appear within the urTurn Application are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to Users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. urTurn does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers may have access to your contact information stored on the host web platform and you are advised to read the privacy policy of the host web platform. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by urTurn and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

  2. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share User Information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the information you post in the urTurn Application will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in the urTurn Application or the host web platform.
