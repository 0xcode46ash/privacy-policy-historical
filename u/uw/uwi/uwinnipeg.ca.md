# Access and Privacy at UWinnipeg - The University Of Winnipeg

## The University of Winnipeg

The University of Winnipeg is committed to providing access to information while also protecting the privacy of its students, employees, and of citizens. Two pieces of legislation govern access and privacy at UWinnipeg:

The **Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)** requires that public bodies make recorded information available to members of the public. It also ensures that personal information contained in records is protected. Click [here](http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/fippa/public_portal_home.html) for more information about FIPPA from the Government of Manitoba.

The **Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)** ensures that individuals can request access to their health information and that trustees of this information are collecting, using and disclosing information in a manner that protects privacy. The University of Winnipeg is a trustee of personal health information that is contained in student records, employee records, and records related to health-related disciplines and services on campus. Click [here](http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/phia/index.html) for more information about PHIA from the Government of Manitoba.

The FIPPA Coordinator manages the University's compliance with the Act, both in coordinating responses to applications for access to information and in assisting the UWinnipeg community in ensuring proper collection, use and disclosure of records and information.
