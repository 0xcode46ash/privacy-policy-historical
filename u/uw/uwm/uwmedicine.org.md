This section explains your rights and some of our responsibilities to help you. 

**Get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record**

  * You can ask in writing to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and other health information we have about you. Ask us how to do this. 
  * We will provide a copy or a summary of your health information. We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee. 



**Ask us to correct your medical record**

  * You can ask us to correct health information about you that you think is incorrect or incomplete. Ask us how to do this. 
  * We may say “no” to your request, but we will tell you why in writing.

  * You can ask us to contact you in a specific way (for example, home or office phone) or to send mail to a different address. 
  * We will say “yes” to all reasonable requests. 



**Ask us to limit what we use or share**

  * You can ask us **not** to use or share certain health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. 
    * We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would affect your care. 
  * If you pay for a service or healthcare item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. 
    * We will say “yes” unless a law requires us to share that information.
