## Protected Health Information

This Notice applies to protected health information (PHI) created or received by the Providers in this Notice that identifies you; relates to your past, present or future physical or mental condition; relates to the care provided; or relates to the past, present or future payment for your healthcare. For example, PHI includes your symptoms, test results, diagnoses, treatment, health information from other providers, and billing and payment information relating to these services. This information often contained in your medical record, among other purposes, serves as:

  * A means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your care. 
  * The legal record describing the care you received. 
  * A means by which you or a third-party payer (such as health-care insurance) can verify that services billed were provided. 
  * A tool to educate health professionals. 
  * A source of data for medical research. 
  * A source of information for public health officials. 
  * A source of information for facility planning. 
  * A tool we use to improve the care we give and the outcomes we achieve. 



Understanding what is in your record and how your health information is used and disclosed helps you to:

  * Ensure accuracy in the record. 
  * Better understand who, what, where, and why others may access your health information. 
  * Make a more informed decision when authorizing disclosures to others. 



* * *

## Use and Disclosure of Your Protected Health Information Without Your Authorization

We may use and disclose PHI without your written authorization for the following reasons: 

**To Provide Treatment.** For example:

  * Your doctor uses your PHI to find out whether certain tests, therapies, and medicines should be ordered. 
  * Nurses may need to know and/or discuss your health problems to care for you and to understand how to evaluate your response to treatment. 
  * We may disclose your PHI to another one of your treatment providers in the community. 
  * We may disclose your prescription information with pharmacies and health plans to improve patient safety and reduce healthcare costs. 



**For Payment Purposes.** For example:

  * We may use PHI to prepare claims for payment of services you have received. 
  * If you have health insurance and we bill your insurance directly, we will include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, the procedures performed, and supplies used so that we can be paid for the treatment provided. 



**For Healthcare Operations.** We may use and disclose your PHI to support daily activities related to healthcare, for example, to monitor and improve our health services or for authorized staff to perform administrative activities. 

**To Train Staff and Students.** For example, our teaching physicians review PHI with medical students. 

**To Conduct Research.** An institutional Review Board (IRB) will review each request to use or disclose your PHI to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of research subjects. In some cases, your PHI might be used or disclosed for research without your consent. For example, we might look at medical charts to see if people who wear bicycle helmets get fewer injuries. We might use some of your PHI to decide if we have enough patients to conduct a cancer research study or include your information in a research database. In these cases, the IRB will determine if using information without your authorization is justified and makes sure that steps are taken to limit its use. In all other cases, we must obtain your authorization to use or disclose your information for a research project. We may share information about you used for research with researchers at other institutions. 

**To Contact You for Information.** Your PHI may be used to contact you call you or send you a letter to remind you about appointments, provide test results, inform you about treatment options or advise you about other health-related benefits and services. 

**To Conduct Fundraising.** The Providers may use basic demographic information limited to your name, date of birth, address, phone number, health insurance status, the dates you received services, department of service information, treating physician information, and outcome information to contact you for fundraising activities. We will not prohibit or condition treatment or payment on whether you choose to receive fundraising communications. We raise funds to expand and support health-care services, educational programs, and research activities related to curing disease. We will not sell, trade, or loan your information to any third parties, but the Providers may share it with third parties working directly for one of the Providers. These third parties must agree to protect the confidentiality of your information. If you do not wish to be contacted as part of our fundraising efforts, please notify us at:
