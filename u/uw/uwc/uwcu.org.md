# Your Privacy Is Important to Us - UW Credit Union (UWCU, University of Wisconsin Credit Union)

Thank you for choosing UW Credit Union to assist you with your financial needs. It is our mission to provide you with excellent solutions and service, as well as to protect your personal financial information.

We are committed to maintaining the highest level of integrity in the protection and use of private member information. In fact, we follow strict business practices that exceed what is legally required.

> **Selling member information** —we never do it.
> 
> **Outside partnerships** —any outside vendor we do business with is required to keep your information private. Any joint marketing partner must keep your information confidential.

This notice details our practices in the collection and use of private information. We’ve also used this opportunity to share with you some helpful tips on protecting your identity.

We appreciate your confidence and the opportunity to serve you.

## Information Collected

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * UW Credit Union applications and forms you’ve submitted to receive a service;
  * Your transactions with UW Credit Union; and
  * A consumer reporting agency



## Disclosure of Information Collected

As permitted by law, we may disclose the nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties:

  * Financial service providers, such as insurance companies and securities broker-dealers.
  * Non-Financial companies, such as consumer reporting agencies, data processors, check/share draft printers, financial statement publishers/printers, plastic card processors, direct marketers, government agencies and mailhouses.
  * Financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, and other companies that perform marketing services on our behalf.
  * Non-affiliated third parties for the purposes of processing and servicing transactions that you request or authorize.



## Confidentiality and Security

To protect our members’ privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell this information to other third parties.

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

If you leave UW Credit Union, we will not share any collected information about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.

## Protect Your Identity

Protect your account numbers, plastic card numbers, personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords. Never keep your PIN with your card. The PIN can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.

Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. Beware if someone calls you requesting information about your UW Credit Union account. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.

Keep your information with us current. If you change your address or phone number, please let us know. It is important we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately.
