# US Lacrosse Privacy Policy

If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy statement, you should first contact Sara Noon, Managing Director of Membership, at [**snoon@uslacrosse.org**](mailto:snoon@uslacrosse.org) or at 410.235.6882 ext. 114.

  **The organization collecting the information.**  
US Lacrosse (USL) is the sole owner of the information collected on its sites and through other means. We will not sell, share, rent, or otherwise disclose this information to other parties other than as disclosed in this statement.

Please be aware that [**www.uslacrosse.org**](http://www.uslacrosse.org/) contains links to other sites and that USL is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. We encourage our users to take appropriate precautions when leaving our site and read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.

**What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our web site and how is it used?**  
USL collects membership information from our users at several different points throughout our web site and from other sources. This section describes these points of collection.

**Membership Registration**  
In order to become a member of USL, an applicant must first complete a membership registration form. During registration an applicant is required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, date of birth and classification. This information is used to create a membership card and to contact the member about topics in which he/she has expressed an interest. All information is required unless otherwise stated on the membership form. This privacy policy governs both members who apply online or otherwise. Financial information is never shared inside or outside our organization, except as necessary to process membership.

**Event Registration**  
In order to register for an event through a USL web site, an entrant is required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, as well as information about his/her event(s)—which may include age, etc. USL sends information about entrants (such as name, age, address, event entered, etc.) to event management personnel so they can properly and accurately prepare team lists and conduct the event. 

**Merchandise Order**  
We request information from customers on our merchandise forms. A customer must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used to fill customers' orders and process payment. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer. Customers' names and addresses may be shared with third parties necessary to process, fulfill, or ship orders. Financial information is never shared inside or outside our organization, except as necessary to process the order. 

**Contests and Surveys**  
From time to time, we conduct contests or surveys. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary, and thus the user has a choice about whether or not to disclose the information requested. 

**Log Files**  
We use standard server log files to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This log file information is not linked to personally identifiable information, and all information gleaned from log files is used only in the aggregate. 

**Other Collection Points**  
We may also collect information from people through other means such as the telephone, by e-mail, by fax, on paper, and in person. This privacy policy governs the use and disclosure of that information as well.

**With whom may the information be shared and other kinds of disclosures.**  
We occasionally share information with other USL entities and third parties. This section describes what information we share and with whom.

**Sharing with USL entities**  
USL Chapters receive reports about members in their chapters, including name, address, phone, e-mail address, etc. This information is used to contact members about general-interest matters and specialized topics in the same manner as described in Section 2 above. Chapters may occasionally share aggregated demographic information with their partners and advertisers. Again, this is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

USL Chapters are required to abide by the national USL privacy policy. Certain chapters may have their own privacy policies, but these will always be more restrictive, never less, than the national policy. In the event that a chapter has a more restrictive policy, that chapter's policy will apply to the individual chapter. In this event, please refer questions first to the chapter, then to the national office. 

**Sharing with non-USL third parties**  
For elite athletes, we also share information from your profile and other sources with the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF) and the International Federation for Women's Lacrosse Association (IFWLA) for administrative purposes. This helps athletes avoid re-entering their information for each organization. These organizations' respective privacy policies govern the use of your information for their purposes. 

USL occasionally enters into partnerships with other organizations to provide valuable services to the lacrosse community. When USL provides the services or collects information from such services, this privacy statement will govern the use of such information for the partnership. 

When someone signs up for an event, we pass on the necessary information (name, address, age) to the event management personnel. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of entering the person in the event. However, this information may be used to create programs, and results for the event which may include entrants' name, home city and state, age, etc. USL has advised event management personnel that if they plan to use this information for purposes other than entering a person in the event, they must notify USL. USL will in turn notify entrants, and entrants will have the option of being excluded from such other purposes at the time of registration. 

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and an outside printing company to print certain publications, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies are directed not to retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose. 

We occasionally share aggregated demographic information with our corporate sponsors, suppliers, partners, and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

From time to time, we also provide postal, phone and e-mail lists to USL corporate partners for the specific purpose of offering discounts or programs which we think might be of interest to our members. These companies will be provided information through a bonded membership is directed not to use these mailing lists for any other purposes or to disclose them to any third party. Members may opt out of inclusion in such lists by contacting us at [**uslacrosse@uslacrosse.org**](mailto:uslacrosse@uslacrosse.org). 

We will also share information to prevent fraud, to respond to legal process, or otherwise as required by law.

**Other kinds of disclosures of personal information**  
USL employees, may have their name, address, fax number, phone number, and e-mail (work and/or home for each) listed both on the web site and in print for contact purposes. Any person who accepts an official position with USL agrees to have his/her contact information made available to USL’s members and the public.

Elite athletes and Hall of Famers may have their biographies posted on the USL web site or otherwise published by USL. These people agree to have certain information about themselves communicated to the public, including, but not limited to, name, home city and state, age, educational background, etc. The names of elite athletes who are subject to drug testing may also be posted on our web site and reported to the media. 

**Children**  
In cases where USL collects personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18, we require parental consent before collection is completed. For example, the USL membership application requires a parent's or guardian's "signature" before it will be accepted. The signature on the application evidences the parent's or guardian's consent to have the child's information used as an aggregate collection. Individual information about children under 18 will not be shared; however information regarding their parents (name, address, e-mail, and phone) can be shared and are subject to this policy.

**The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under USL's control**.  
USL takes every reasonable precaution to protect users' information: however USL can not guarantee that your information is 100% secure. When users submit sensitive information, the information is protected both on- and off-line. 

When registration forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard encryption software (SLL). While on a secure page, such as our membership application, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers (i.e. Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer) appears locked. If not locked, any information a user submits is not secure, and USL will not be responsible for the loss or theft of such information. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also make every reasonable effort to protect users' information off-line. Access to users' information, not only the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our organization. Only those employees who need the information to perform their job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices and are reminded about the importance we place on privacy. 

USL makes every reasonable effort to safeguard sensitive information by regularly reviewing our security standards and practices to protect against unauthorized access. If you have any questions about the security of our web site, you can send an an e-mail to [blogue@uslacrosse.org](mailto:blogue@uslacrosse.org).

  **What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.**

**Choice and opting in/out**  
We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to confirm their membership status. Members may opt out of various mailings by following the instructions provided at the bottom of e-mail messages, or by contacting our Membership Services group either by e-mailing us at [**uslacrosse@uslacrosse.org**](mailto:uslacrosse@uslacrosse.org) or by calling 410.235.6882 ext. 102. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your address, phone, e-mail address, etc.), this can be changed by the user by contacting the Membership Services department at the US Lacrosse national office. 

For elite athletes, biographies are updated throughout the year, and any inaccuracies may be corrected by notifying Brian Logue, Director of Communications at [**blogue@uslacrosse.org**](mailto:blogue@uslacrosse.org). Such changes will be reflected in the next release of the athlete biographies. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If USL changes its privacy policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage for at least seven days so users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point USL decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, users will have a choice whether to opt-out from such use.
