### U.S. Naval Institute Privacy Statement

When an individual visits the U.S. Naval institute website, our web server automatically logs the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider, but not the individual's e-mail address. There is no information stored in our server logs that would allow us to identify visitors to our site. We do not utilize "cookies"; that is, except for the web pages cached by your browser, our server does not write any information to any storage device attached to your personal computer, nor does it retrieve any information previously stored on your personal computer. If you use our secure online server to order merchandise, we ask that you submit the minimal amount of information needed to process the order: your name, shipping address, telephone number, credit-card number, and e-mail address. This information is encrypted via transit over the Internet. Once it arrives at our server, which is protected behind an Internet "firewall," it is forwarded immediately to our customer-service department for processing and deleted from our server. We use this information in order to contact you should a problem arise with your order. We do not use this information to promote other products or services to you. Should we, in the future, decide to use information collected during the ordering process to promote the U.S. Naval Institute or Naval Institute publications or products, we will state so clearly on all order forms. The customer will always have the option to request that his or her information be excluded from any such use. This option will be made available via a check-box or similar device prominently located on all order forms. All such requests will be honored. We will never provide any information collected during the purchasing process to any third party.

When an individual elects to join the Naval Institute using our secure online membership form, additional information is collected in order to help us better meet the needs of our membership community. This information is also encrypted via transit over the Internet, and immediately forwarded to our membership department upon arrival at our protected server. If you have questions about how information supplied during membership submission is utilized, please [e-mail](mailto:nkunkel@usni.org?subject=Questions%20About%20Information%20Supplied%20During%20Membership%20Submission) us.
