The Site does not collect personally identifying information from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you specifically and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information. Information is collected through the completion of on-line forms, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, user names, passwords, or other personal information. We do collect aggregate information such as pages visited, which is necessary for us to be sure that our site functions correctly. 

**Cookies**

This website uses “cookie” technology. “Cookies” are encrypted strings of text that a Web site stores on a user's computer. This website requires the use of a cookie to keep information you enter on multiple pages together. Some cookies are “session” cookies that expire when you close your browser. We also use “persistent” cookies to measure usage of various pages on our website and to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access. These persistent cookies are our cookies and will remain on your computer unless deleted by you. We do not use cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with us. You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this); although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on our website.

  * Information we receive from you, such as on applications or other forms. 
  * Information about your transactions we secure from our files, or from our affiliates or others.

We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our website and how we can enhance your experience, its contents and functionality to meet your needs and personal interests. We will also log the webpage visitors were on before visiting us, and use that data to formulate statistical models.   
On occasion, we may make information collected on the Site available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the REDC family of companies. We may also share or sell, as allowed by law, information to other companies who we believe may have products and services of interest to you.

**Law Enforcement**

If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency, as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.

**Links**

The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites to which we link. Users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in public forums, such information may be collected by others and may result in receiving unsolicited messages. We strongly encourage you to be aware that when you leave our site you should read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Security  
**  
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for sensitive data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. We also use SSL on other select pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

After information reaches the Site, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of the Site. If you are interested in learning more about our security measures please contact us at the address above.

**Data Quality, Access, and Updating Personal Information**

The Site will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information and data is complete, accurate, and timely for the desired purposes. If your personally identifiable information changes (such as phone number), is inaccurate, or if you no longer desire the services, you should contact the Company to correct or update the information.

**Choice/ Opt-out**

From time to time, we may send users e-mail, e-mail newsletters, or website news updates alerting you to new features, products, promotions, or services pertaining to the website. Users who no longer wish to receive materials from us may opt-out of receiving these communications by choosing a "do not contact" option or by contacting us at the address above. We will gladly comply with all requests for removal. 

Opt Out Procedure: In compliance with the Can-Spam Act of 2003, on each email transmitted by the Site, there are instructions for opting out of receiving future emails. Such instructions may include, without limitation: (a) clicking a link on the email which sends a reply to the sender’s server instructing the server of the sender’s desire to opt out of future emails, or (b) instructions for mailing a written request to be removed from future emails. All requests to opt out of future emails will be respected.

**Notification of Changes**

In the future, we may need to change the privacy statement for the Site. All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we may share it with anyone. This statement was last updated September 23, 2008.
