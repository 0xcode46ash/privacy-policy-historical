# PRIVACY POLICY

THANK YOU for visiting the Postal Service's Web site and reviewing our privacy commitment to you. Your privacy is of great importance to us and our Web site has been developed with that in mind. We recognize your right to know what information is being collected about you and how that information will be used, as well as our obligations to limit collection and protect what we do collect. 

_Our Internet privacy policy is:_

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site. 
  * We collect personally identifiable information (name, email address, or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. We collect the information to respond to your inquiry, or to assist in providing you USPS products or services in which you have expressed an interest. In some cases, the personally identifiable information you provide will be used to merely respond to your electronic inquiry and will not be maintained. If we ask you to provide personally identifiable information in order to take advantage of a postal product or service, and we maintain that information, we will give you a Privacy Act statement before transmission of your information to us. It will tell you the purposes for collecting the information and the potential uses of it. Without further express consent from you, the Postal Service will: 1) use the information solely to respond to your inquiry or provide the requested product or service; and 2) will not provide the information to any third parties, except entities assisting the USPS in providing products and services you request ("service providers"). 
  * We collect information for statistical purposes, as the Postal Service sometimes performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site. Except for service providers, we will disclose this information to third parties only in aggregate form. 
  * The Postal Service uses cookies (a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of the site) for limited purposes that enable your use of and improve the functionality of our Web site. We gather certain information about your visit to our Web site, but this information does not identify you personally.

_Information Collected and Stored Automatically_

If you do nothing during your visit but browse our Web site, read its pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically through the use of standard web server log files. This information is anonymous and **does not** identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit: 

  1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site; 
  2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  3. The date and time you access our site; 
  4. The pages you visit; and 
  5. If you linked to the Postal Service Web site from another Web site, the Internet address of that Web site. 

We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, and technical information that will enhance ease of use, such as, the types of technology our visitors use and system performance or problem areas. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. 

_Information collected from e-mails and on-line forms_

Most of our Web pages allow you to send us an e-mail. If your e-mail message includes personally identifiable information, as for example in an electronic mail message containing an inquiry, we will use that information to respond to your inquiry. In addition, in some cases it may be used to provide information or to fill your order for postal products and services in which you have expressed an interest.  
Remember that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you should send it by mail unless our Web site indicates the particular site is secured. 

_Information from Children_

From time to time as part of a special Postal Service promotion, such as stamp collecting, we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will do so only with parental notice and consent. In doing so, we will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating, and will fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

_Security -- Detection of unauthorized intrusions_

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. 

_Significant actions when information enters a System of Records_

Some of our Web sites allow you to purchase postal products and services or request information electronically. In those instances, we will collect the information needed to fulfill your order or request, just as though your order or request had been made on paper. That information will be maintained and protected in accordance with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which means that it will be secured in transit to us and once received. Before transmitting the information to us, you will be given a Privacy Act statement that tells you the purpose for collection and the potential disclosures that may be made of the information you provide. We will let you know those circumstances in which it may be necessary to make a disclosure-such as to fulfill your order, to a government agency for law enforcement or other official need, or to congress on your behalf. Under the Privacy Act, we are barred from otherwise disclosing the information. 

_Choice - Opt-in_

If you provide express specific consent, the Postal Service may use data collected to notify you of other USPS products or services in which you may be interested. 

_Access_

You have the right to review any of your personal information the Postal Service has collected from you by contacting the program that provided you the product or service you requested. The Postal Service will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request.
