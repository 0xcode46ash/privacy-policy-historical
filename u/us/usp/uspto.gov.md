# Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the United States Patent and Trademark Office website and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is simple: we collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

Submitting personal information is **voluntary**. When you **voluntarily submit** information, it constitutes your **consent** to the use of the information for the **purpose(s)** **stated at the time of collection**. See the [Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579)](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202160203id_/http%3A//www.uspto.gov/web/doc/privacyacttext.htm) for more information on your rights under the Privacy Act.

For the protection of users of our Web sites, we have safeguards in place to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts to access or cause harm to information and systems. 

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: 

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

> The USPTO web server collects and saves only the default information customarily logged by World-Wide Web server software. Specifically, for each http request received, the **date and time** , the **originating IP address** , the **object** requested, and the **completion status** of the request is collected and saved.
> 
> We analyze these logs monthly to determine the traffic through the server during that month in hits, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages of interest during each month. We may also analyze accesses to particular pages to determine US versus non-US use, government agency versus private use, and other statistics that may be of value to us in establishing priorities and allocating resources in order to better accomplish our dissemination mission. 

**E-mail** submitted to USPTO is saved in accordance to Department of Commerce policy and NARA guidelines. If you choose to provide us with personal information in e-mail, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We do **not** collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do **not** store any personal information independent of the e-mail message, create individual profiles with the information you provide, or give it to any private organizations. We do **not** collect information for commercial marketing. 

**Links to Other Sites**

> Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we link to private organizations, with their permission. Before leaving our website, a page will appear informing you that you are leaving our server. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. 

**Kids Pages**

> We are especially concerned about protecting the privacy of children. We hope parents and teachers are involved in childrenâ€™s Internet explorations. We respect the need to protect the identity of any children who participate in an Internet exhibition of their work. We do not request any information from children on the Kids Pages. We do, however, sometimes encourage them to participate in contests, but such participation is carried out through postal mail. [Click here ](http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ahrpa/opa/kids/kidcontest.html) for more details on contest rules and regulations. 

**FirstGov Search**

> We utilize **FirstGov.gov** to perform searches of our webpages. When you request a search, a **memory resident** (session) **cookie** is generated to maintain the search query information during the search session with FirstGov. When you complete the search, the cookie terminates.

**Site Survey Instrument**

> We use a **memory resident** (session) **cookie** to store a page counter to trigger our website customer satisfaction survey. A **voluntary** survey instrument collects responses to a standard set of questions and forwards them along with the location of the web page that you were viewing when the survey was activated to **FORESEE RESULTS** for aggregation and reporting purposes. **No** information regarding what you were doing on the website or what other pages you visited during your session is collected. When you exit the USPTO.GOV website, the cookie terminates. See [About the USPTO.GOV Site Survey](http://www.uspto.gov/main/sitesurvey.htm) for more information.

**Privacy Act Systems of Records**

> Where this site requests information that will be stored in a **Privacy Act system of records** , an individual Privacy Act notice is provided. Should there ever be a need to use information for a purpose other than one already provided for under the Privacy Act, we will give you **specific instructions** on how you may **consent** to such use. **You are never required to give such consent**. 
> 
> Information stored in any Privacy Act System of Records is handled as set forth in the applicable System of Records Notice in order to preserve its security and confidentiality. Privacy Act System of Records notices are available at: [http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/PrivacyAct.shtml](http://www.uspto.gov/cgi-bin/exitconf/internet_exitconf.pl?target=www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/PrivacyAct.shtml)

**Use of Cookies on TEAS and OEMS:**

> We use memory resident cookies on our TEAS and OEMS systems to maintain browser session integrity. **No** personal information is gathered and it is **not** stored on your hard drive. When you exit our site, the cookie terminates.
