USP respects the privacy of its customers and takes its responsibilities regarding the security of customer information very seriously. USP is committed to providing professional and valuable service while safeguarding privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all USP websites.

This Privacy Policy has been created to explain the way in which USP uses personal data. This information will help you to decide whether or not to provide USP with personal data.

USP may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. USP will notify you of all material changes through the USP website prior to any change being implemented.

Personal data is any information that allows you to be identified. The types of personal data USP collects may include your name, title, employer, address, telephone number, email address, and fax number. USP collects personal data from you through the use of registration forms, direct personal contact with you (for example, over the telephone), and every time you email us your details. USP will only use your personal data where it is necessary to do so because it is relevant to USP's dealings with you or where it is has your consent. This includes but is not limited to billing, customer service, and network management. USP may use your personal data for direct marketing, including offers for USP products and services, and for customer surveys. USP will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. If, at any time, you object to USP's use of your personal data for direct marketing or to the media in which such material is being sent, you may choose to unsubscribe to its receipt.

USP will not disclose or share your personal data with any other third party without your express consent, unless this is necessary to provide the services or products which you requested when providing us with your personal data, or as required by law.

You understand and agree that "perfect" security does not exist anywhere, including on the Internet. When you send credit card information to USP over the Internet, USP encrypts this information between your computer and our server. Other information you send to USP, including email messages, will not be encrypted unless USP advises you otherwise. USP may use "cookies" on its websites. A "cookie" is information that a website puts on your hard drive so that it can remember pieces of information about you when you next visit the website or a related website. USP uses cookies to record personal data about you when you use an USP website in order to facilitate your future activities. USP will not share personal data sent in a cookie with third parties. If you prefer not to receive cookies from USP's website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser but this may impair your experience of USP's website. USP has appropriate technical and organizational security measures intended to prevent unauthorized or unlawful disclosure or access to or, accidental or unlawful loss of or destruction, or alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or access to, or other damage to your personal data. These measures are intended to ensure an appropriate level of security in relation to the risks inherent in the processing and the nature of the personal data to be protected. Your personal data will only be accessible by select members of staff within USP.

USP will only keep your information for as long as we are either required to by law, or as is relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. You may contact USP at any time if you would like to correct, update, supplement or delete personal data. You may also contact USP at any time to opt-out of receiving communications from USP at the point where USP requests information about you.
