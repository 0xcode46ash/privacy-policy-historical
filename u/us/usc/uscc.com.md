### Sharing of your Confidential Personal Information

U.S. Cellular does not sell your Confidential Personal Information for any purpose other than to enforce our rights under the Terms of Service or as expressly stated in this Privacy Statement.

###  Accessing your Confidential Personal Information 

We ask customers and their Authorized Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. If you or your Authorized User contacts us via phone, you will be asked to provide information in order to authenticate you as an authorized party on the account before we are able to assist you with account information. You or your Authorized user will be asked to present a valid government issued photo ID when requesting account information while at a retail store.

Access to call detail or text message detail is available only by registering for online access to billing information through My Account, calling and requesting a copy to be sent to the customer's billing address of record, or obtaining a copy by visiting one of our company owned retail stores.
