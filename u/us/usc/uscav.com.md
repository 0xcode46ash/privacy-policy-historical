# Privacy Policy

### Our Commitment to Privacy

At U.S. Cavalry, customer satisfaction is our goal. We are committed to ensuring your privacy as a customer.

To better protect your privacy, we provide this policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### The Information We Collect

When placing an online order, requesting a catalog, or ordering a gift certificate, we collect the following information: name, company name (optional), address, phone number, e-mail address, gift message (if applicable), and credit card information. In cases where your order is being sent as a gift, we do collect the recipient's name, company name (optional), address, and phone number.

When you send us an e-mail or use the form on the 'How to Contact Us' section of our Customer Service page or the 'Help Desk', we collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail content.

We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other information that you submit on our 'Refer UScav.com to a Friend' Page.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information on our surveys, nor is the survey data that we do collect associated with any information you submit while placing an order with us.

### Online Advertising and Cookies

When you visit our website, a "cookie" is placed on your computer to tell us which parts of our website were viewed.  **This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer** , all it does is give us anonymized information and says "this person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page." Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. If you do not wish to see ads from uscav.com you can opt out in several ways:

Among information collected are Age, Gender and Interest Categories.  **Please note that this information is NEVER merged with your personally identifiable account information.  **We can only view the grouped data which cannot be associated with any particular individual.

For better privacy controls, Google has created a [browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) to allow you to opt out of Google Analytics.
