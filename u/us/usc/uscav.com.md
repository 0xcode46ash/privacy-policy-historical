# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy

At U.S. Cavalry, customer satisfaction is our goal. We are committed to ensuring your privacy as a customer.

To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and most of our other pages including those pages where personally identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect

When placing an online order, requesting a catalog, or ordering a gift certificate, we collect the following information: name, company name (optional), address, phone number, e-mail address, gift message (if applicable), and credit card information. In cases where your order is being sent as a gift, we do collect the recipient's name, company name (optional), address, and phone number.

When you send us an e-mail or use the form on the 'How to Contact Us' section of our Customer Service page or the 'Help Desk', we collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail content.

We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other information that you submit on our 'Refer UScav.com to a Friend' Page.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information on our surveys, nor is the survey data that we do collect associated with any information you submit while placing an order with us.

### Online Advertising and Cookies

As part of an effort to show only the most relevant information to our customers, uscav.com uses Google AdWords Remarketing. When you visit our website, a "cookie" is placed on your computer to tell us which parts of our website were viewed. **This cookie does not in any way identify you or give access to your computer** , all it does is give us anonymized information and says "this person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page." Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. If you do not wish to see ads from uscav.com you can opt out in several ways:

1\. Opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads).  
2\. Opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

### Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reports

To better understand our visitors, uscav.com has enabled the _Demographics and Interest Reports_  feature of Google Analytics. This feature helps us segment our audiences to understand which products are relevant to our visitors. Among information collected are Age, Gender and Interest Categories. **Please note that this information is NEVER merged with your presonally identifiable account information.  **We can only view the grouped data which cannot be associated with any particular individual.

For better privacy controls, Google has created a [browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) to allow you to opt out of Google Analytics.  

## How We Use The Information

The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your order and in improving your overall shopping experience with us.

When you send us an e-mail or use the form on the 'How to Contact Us' section of our Customer Service page or the 'Help Desk', we use the information you submit to address particular questions and/or problems you may have with our web site or your order.

We do not sell or exchange e-mail addresses with third parties.

We occasionally make our list of names and mailing addresses (but not e-mail addresses) available to companies and organizations whose products and activities may be of interest to you.
