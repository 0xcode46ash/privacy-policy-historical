# USC Fashion & Designer Clothes for Men & Women

At USC Ltd we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to progress orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience. Please read on for more detail about our privacy policy.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

**  
** When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status. 

We also ask for your telephone number which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order (for some international deliveries, this number may be given to our couriers). 

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 

We personalise your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about the merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store. 

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to usc.co.uk, new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and distribution of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

We do not store or see any credit card information on systems. All credit card transactions are cleared using HSBC’s banking system.

When you create an online account with USC Ltd we do not sell, trade or rent any personal information gathered. 

USC Ltd may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

When you enter a joint competition or promotion with USC and another party then the information gathered will be shared between the two parties. 

USC Ltd reserve the right to co-operate with legal officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. USC Ltd will have no legal liability for such disclosures.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at www.usc.co.uk possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by USC Ltd. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
