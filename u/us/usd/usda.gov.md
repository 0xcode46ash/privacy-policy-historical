Privacy Act Statement

The following statement is made in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 USC 552a) as amended. The authority for requesting the following information is the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, GPEA (Pub. L. 105-277), the Freedom to E-File Act (Pub. L. 106-222), the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, E-SIGN (Pub. L. 106-229), and the E-Government Act of 2002 (H.R. 2458). The information will be used to establish secure information transactions by enabling the electronic authentication and authorization of users desiring access to USDA Web applications and services via the Internet. Furnishing the requested information is voluntary. However, if this information is not provided, electronic access to USDA Web applications and services will not be permitted. This information may be provided to other agencies, IRS, Department of Justice, or other State and Federal Law enforcement agencies, and in response to a court magistrate or administrative tribunal. The provisions of criminal and civil fraud statutes, including 18 USC 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001; 15 USC 714m; and 31 USC 3729, may be applicable to the information provided.
