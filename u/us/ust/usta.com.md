USTA Internet Privacy Policy

** **

Welcome

**

Welcome to www.usta.com. This site is owned by the United States Tennis Association (the "USTA"). This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that we may collect from and about you. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site _._ This site is intended for use by residents of the United States.

**

Your Consent

**

By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service and any specific provisions of this site that may be presented at the time information is collected.

**

About Children

**

Children can surf www.usta.com, www.usatennis.com or other USTA sites, view content, and utilize certain functions without any personally identifiable information being collected. The USTA does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from site visitors under the age of 13, and encourages parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.

**

Active Information Collection

**

Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking them specific questions and by permitting them to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, chat rooms and so forth. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number and so on).

Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing and so forth) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions and so forth). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.

**

Passive Information Collection

**

As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol address logging, cookies, Internet tags and navigational data collection. These are briefly described below.

The USTA tracks **Internet Protocol (IP) addresses** on this site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that you can access the Internet, and it is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information. In most cases, an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). The USTA uses your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, administer and improve the site, and perform other related functions.

Another technology commonly used on Web sites is the " **cookie** ". A cookie is a short text file that a Web site sends to your Web browser that helps the Web site remember information about you and your preferences. There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.

" **Session** " cookies are temporary data files that are designed to be erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on Web sites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This site does not use session cookies.

" **Persistent** " cookies are text files which are designed to be permanently stored on your computer’s hard drive and remain there until you delete them. Persistent cookies can store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (for example, passwords), helping to determine what areas of the Web site visitors find most valuable, and customizing the Web site display based on your preferences (for example, remembering the zip code you entered in order to identify local events). This site uses persistent cookies.

" **Web tags** " (also known as Internet tags, single-pixel GIFs and invisible GIFs) are tiny graphic files which are downloaded by your Web browser. The process of downloading a Web tag allows the server downloading the file to identify the IP address of the computer downloading the file, the URL of the page the Web tag is located on, and the time the Web tag was downloaded. The process of downloading a Web tag also allows the server transmitting the Web tag to give your computer a cookie or read/edit a cookie the server previously gave to your computer. The USTA does not use such Web tags on this site.

****

**"Navigational data"** ("log files," "server logs" and "clickstream" data) are used, among other things, for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This site records and uses navigational data.

**

Information From Other Sources

**

From time to time USTA may receive information about you from other sources and add it to the data previously collected about you.

**

Use and Disclosure of Information

**

Except as otherwise stated, USTA may use information you provide to improve the content of our site, to customize the display of the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.

If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, the USTA may combine such information with other actively collected information unless specified otherwise at the point of collection on this site. The USTA may combine personally identifiable information with passively collected information.

The USTA may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties located in the United States and/or any other country:

  1. to USTA affiliates;
  2. to USTA sponsors;
  3. to other tennis related organizations;
  4. to select companies or organizations which the USTA believes may offer products, services, materials or information of interest to visitors to this site;
  5. to third parties we use to support our business (including fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, chat service providers, email service providers, forum service providers and financial institutions);
  6. in connection with the sale, assignment or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates; or
  7. where required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations.



In addition, the USTA will make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in personally identifiable form.

**

Access and Correction

**

To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current and complete, please contact USTA as specified below. USTA will take reasonable steps to update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site.

**

Security

**

USTA will take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, usernames, ID numbers or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.

This site may contain links or references to other Web sites. Please be aware that the USTA does not control other Web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. The USTA encourages you to read the privacy policy of every Web site you visit.
