# Privacy Policy - U.S. Soccer

Effective Date: January 1, 2005

**The U.S. Soccer Internet Privacy Policy  
** Thank you for visiting the U.S. Soccer Federation ("U.S. Soccer") online. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. 

This Privacy Policy complies with North American (U.S. and Canada) best privacy practices and follows all known legislation in North American territories. Guests on the U.S. Soccer web sites from outside of the United States and Canada are advised that the U.S. Soccer Privacy Policy does not necessarily follow the laws and regulations of your home country. 

**The Intenet, Privacy, And U.S. Soccer  
** U.S. Soccer's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our Guests. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. 

The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At U.S. Soccer we strive to help our Guests protect their privacy while using our services. 

**U.S. Soccer's Web Sites To Which Policy Applies  
** U.S. Soccer currently operates the following web sites to which this policy applies: 

  * ussoccer.com 
  * ussoccerfan.com 
  * ussoccer.info 



In addition, U.S. Soccer owns other domain names that point to the web sites listed above. From time to time we may add new sites that may not be listed above, but will provide a link to this policy. 

**Use Of Guest Information  
** Although information may be required to participate in certain promotions or sales offered through our web site, participants provide information on a voluntary basis only. Generally, we may wish to collect personal information about you in connection with the following services: 

  * Participation in any online contests, sweepstakes or other promotions we might offer 
  * Questions or comments sent through our web site; 
  * Inclusion in our online newsletter program; 
  * Participation in any message boards or chat rooms we may establish; 
  * Registration to become a registered user of our sites; and 
  * Registration as a referee or a coach. 



Collection of personal information for these services may include the collection of your name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, demographic information, age range, interests and/or other information. U.S. Soccer needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes and purchases, tracking/verifying compliance with U.S. Soccer's policies and federal, state, and local laws, and for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. 

The information you provide for your personal ussoccerfan.com account is shared among the U.S. Soccer sites listed above, as it is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. The U.S. Soccer may disclose Guest information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) U.S. Soccer's rights or property, other U.S. Soccer site Guests, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. U.S. Soccer may disclose Guest information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

U.S. Soccer has several sponsors and other business partners that can offer valuable products and services to our Guests. U.S. Soccer will not disclose your e-mail address to these partners, unless you have indicated that you wish to receive information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. From time to time, U.S. Soccer shares aggregate information about our Guests with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties, in addition, U.S. Soccer may provide them with mailing addresses so that they may extend offers to you. For an example of aggregate information, we may say U.S. Soccer's audience is x percent female and y percent male. This data is used to customize U.S. Soccer's online content and advertising, to deliver a better experience for our Guests. If you do not want your personal information shared with these parties, you may make such request by writing to U.S. Soccer, 1801 South Prairie Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60616, Attn: Marketing Department or by sending an email to [webmaster@ussoccer.org](mailto:webmaster@ussoccer.org). 

**Policies For Kids(Individuals Under 13 Years Of Age)  
** U.S. Soccer encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role to protect the privacy of their children and to prevent inappropriate use of information about their children. No information should be submitted to or posted at the U.S. Soccer site by Guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Parents and guardians should instruct their children never to give out real names or any other identifying information over the Internet without first getting parental permission. 

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection or in this privacy policy, U.S. Soccer does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our Guests under 13 years of age. 

**Links To Other Sites  
** Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. For example, if you "click" on a link, the "click" may take you off the U.S. Soccer site(s). This includes links from sponsors and partners that may use the U.S. Soccer logo as part of a co-branding or other agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to Guests, collect data, or solicit personal information. We make every effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, U.S. Soccer cannot control any of these links and is not responsible for any content appearing on sites linked to or from U.S. Soccer's site(s), or for any personal information gathered at those sites. Guests should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by these third parties. Children 12 and under should get parental permission before linking to other sites. 

**Security  
** The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, U.S. Soccer cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

Your ussoccerfan.com account is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. U.S. Soccer will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.
