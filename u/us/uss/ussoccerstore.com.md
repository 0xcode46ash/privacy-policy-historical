**Website Log Information**  
When your Web browser requests information from our site, our Web server automatically records the date, time, and IP address from which your request came. From this information, we can sometimes, but not always, determine the domain and host name of the network provider to which you are connected, such as MSN, America Online, your local ISP, etc. This information does not identify you individually, and we do not seek to do this. You are an "anonymous" user unless you choose to send us email, fill out an online form to request more information, add your name to one of our email lists, or purchase one of our USSoccerStore.com products. We use the aggregate information in our visitor files to determine usage and "popularity" of various parts of our web site. Sometimes we share web site log information with our business partners for advertising, promotional or merchandising purposes, and to help improve our site and make it more useful to you.

Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption.
