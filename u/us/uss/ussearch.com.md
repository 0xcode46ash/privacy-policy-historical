---  
   
US SEARCH is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our Web site. The following policy describes how US SEARCH protects information it receives from visitors to its Web properties.  
   
**1.  ** | **What information does US SEARCH collect and how does US SEARCH use it?**  
  | US Search collects personally identifiable information when you: visit our site, when you purchase products and when you elect to be included in our opt-out program. When you visit our site we may collect information such as an email address and/or may use "cookies" (see below). This information is used to enhance your user experience and provide you with information regarding US Search services and special offers. When you order services or register on US Search properties, we may need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and credit card information. When processing transactions such as credit card payments, this information may be sent to reputable third parties for fraud detection. These vendors maintain an obligation of confidentiality with regard to such information. When you elect to be included in our opt-out program, we may need you to provide personal information including but not limited to: your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, past addresses and aliases. This information is used to help prevent your private information, as distinguished from your public record information, from being disclosed through US Search services.  
   
As a visitor, you will also be given a choice when navigating through the US Search Web site or when ordering services, whether or not you would like to be included on US Search's mailing list. If you are included on US Search's mailing list, we may notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.  
   
US Search implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have specific access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Should it be necessary to transmit your personal information to a reputable third party vendor to: (1) fulfill our service commitment to you, (2) to include you in our opt-out program, or (3) to process your credit card, US Search will require all recipients of such information to maintain the information as confidential information and agree not to disclose such information to third parties.  
   
US Search may disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, court order or pursuant to government or law enforcement authority request or in a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary or advisable under the circumstances.  
   
**2.  ** | **Does US SEARCH disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?**  
  | US Search does not sell, lease or rent personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide in any form including but not limited to order forms and opt-out program requests. This information is used to better understand your use of US Search's site and to support related transactions made on the site. US Search may send your personally identifiable information to third parties when: (1) we have your consent; (2) we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; (3) we need to send the information to companies working on US Search's behalf including but not limited to credit card processing services (these companies have agreed to maintain information provided by US Search as secure confidential information that will not be disclosed unless legally required to do so); (4) we find that you have violated any stated terms of service or conditions of purchase; or (5) we respond to court orders or legal process.  
   
**3.  ** | **Can US Search remove information about me from US Search reports?**  
  | 

US Search, as a data aggregator, accesses numerous third party databases to gather information for our reports. If you would like to remove yourself from US Search reports you can do so by joining US Search's opt-out program. The opt-out program covers reports that contain non-publicly available information that is sold to the general public. US Search will use good faith efforts to help prevent your non-public information from being distributed. We cannot provide any assurance that information that is otherwise publicly available, such as court records, will be withheld. If you would like to be included in our opt-out program, you should contact us by writing a letter giving your complete name (first, last and middle initial), name variations (aliases), current mailing address, past mailing address going back 15 years, date of birth and social security number to:
