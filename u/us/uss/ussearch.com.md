**US Search does not incorporate the information collected while you visit or make a purchase on our site for resale in our services.

We, or our authorized third party affiliates, may also collect general information about purchases as they correspond to our advertisements or products. This aggregate information may include demographic and usage information, but will not include personally identifiable information. This information is used in an aggregated manner (i.e. How many customers purchased service "ABC") to determine advertising effectiveness and is sometimes shared with our advertising partners for the same limited purpose. 

   In addition information is collected for the following purposes: 

  1. When you order services or register on US Search properties, we may need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and credit card or checking account information.

The opt-out program will not ensure that your personally identifiable information found in public records will not be disclosed. If you voluntarily submit your information for the purpose of not having your information distributed, it will only be used for that purpose and for no other purpose.
