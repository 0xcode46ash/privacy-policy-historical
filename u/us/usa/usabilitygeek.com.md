# Privacy Policy - Usability Geek

At UsabilityGeek.com we are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. In this regard, we will not collect any personal information about you as a visitor unless you provide it voluntarily. However, in order to function properly, the technology behind this website may gather information about you. This policy sets out what information may be gathered and how we treat it.

By using this website, you agree to accept this privacy policy. 

## Anonymous Information Collected

We collect information submitted by your browser about your visit to and use of this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, pageviews, operating system and navigation. Such information is recorded in our website analytics software and our web server’s log files.

We use this information for 

  * Administration and marketing purposes
  * To troubleshoot any technical issues
  * To ensure the delivery of a great user experience



We may share an aggregated version of this information and disclose it to our third-party advertising partners. This information does not personally identify you and it is primarily used to provide demographics about the visitors of this website.

## Personally Identifiable Information Collected

We do not ask for your personal information unless we truly need it and you willingly provide it to us. This is why the only personally identifiable information that we collect occurs when you subscribe to our newsletter. In fact, we only ask you to provide us with an email address where we will send our newsletter to. This information is stored on the servers of our email newsletter provider, MailChimp. We do not store a copy of your email address on our server and we will never sell it to third parties.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

This website makes use of cookies to personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small file that is sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the web browser. This file is used to store information such as which pages you visit and thus customize the layout of this website based on your browser type and the device that you are using to access it.

Our advertising partners may also use their own cookies and/or web beacons for a number of reasons. These include the ability to deliver adverts that are more relevant to the website visitor, record the number of times an advert has appeared and how many website visitors have clicked it. This information is provided on an anonymous basis, meaning that they cannot personally identify you if you have seen an advert or clicked on one. However, we have no access or control over third-party advertisers’ cookies or how they are using them.

Cookies do not personally identify you. Web browsers are set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. You can easily change your cookie acceptance policy through the settings of the web browser you are using. This should not cause any major issues in the overall experience with this website.
