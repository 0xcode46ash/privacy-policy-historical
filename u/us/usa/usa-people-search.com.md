# Privacy Policy

**Information Collected and Use**  
USA People Search is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others without your explicit permission.   
**Registration**  
During registration a user is required to give their contact and billing information (such as a name, email address, credit card information). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest, and to make purchases.   
**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user's current session. USA People Search uses cookies to keep track of whether a user is logged in. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.   
**People Database**  
The records that you see when you run searches on USA People Search are all public records. If you are surprised to see yourself in our database, this is most likely due to having property records, marriage records, or some other type of public record that was created at some time in your life. We don't create any of the records in our database, we simply aggregate public records from thousands of sources. We are basically like Google, but instead of searching for web sites you are searching for people.   
**Security**  
USA People search takes every precaution to protect out users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. 

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or contact information), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry. Our servers are behind firewalls as well. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
