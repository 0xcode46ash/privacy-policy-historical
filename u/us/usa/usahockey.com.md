**How We Use Personal Information.**   We use your personal information to provide the information, offerings and services you request.  For example, we use your e-mail address to respond to your comments and questions or to send e-mail newsletters.  We may use your personal information to personalize this Site to meet your specific needs. 

We also use personal information collected through this Site to improve the content and functionality of this Site, to better understand our visitors and members, to improve our offerings and services, and to market our events, offerings and services to our visitors and members.  In addition, we use personal information to contact you with offers and information about events, offerings and services from other organizations that we believe will be of interest to you.  If you would prefer that we not contact you for such purposes, you may indicate this preference by sending an email to [unsubscribe@usahockey.org](mailto:unsubscribe@usahockey.org) or by writing us at  USA Hockey, Inc., 1775 Bob Johnson Drive, Colorado Springs, CO, 80906, Attn.: Online Services Department.  We will use reasonable efforts to honor such requests.  You must understand, however, that even if you “opt-out,” you may still receive communications from us, for example, if we receive your contact information from another source or if we initiated the communication before we received your “opt-out” request. 

**Disclosure of Personal Information.**   We share personal information collected through this Site with our affiliated organizations (such as other hockey associations, leagues or teams) and other organizations that are part of our affiliates, who may use this information in ways similar to how we use this information.  We also share personal information collected through this Site with selected third party business partners, who use the information to provide special opportunities and offers to you. 

If you would prefer that we not share your personal information with our affiliated organizations or business partners, you may indicate this preference by sending an email to [unsubscribe@usahockey.org](mailto:unsubscribe@usahockey.org) or by writing us at  USA Hockey, Inc., 1775 Bob Johnson Drive, Colorado Springs, CO  80906, Attn.: Online Services.  We will use reasonable efforts to honor such requests.  You must understand, however, that even if you “opt-out,” you may still receive communications from our affiliated organizations or business partners, for example, if they received your contact information from another source or if they initiated the communication before we received your “opt-out” request.

 We share personal information collected through this Site with third party vendors who act for us or on our behalf, for example, to help us fill your orders, run promotions or provide other support services.  Our affiliates and our business partners may also share personal information with vendors who provide support services to them.  These vendors need information about you in order to perform their functions.  These vendors are not authorized to use the information we share with them (or that our affiliates and business partners share with them) for any purpose other than to provide services to us, our affiliates or our business partners.   

In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer personal information in our databases to a third party, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect the security of our systems or service, or in the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. 

**Other Information Collected Through This Site.**   We use technology that tells us how visitors use this Site, for example, which pages they view, which links they use and which search terms they input.  This information is called “click-stream data.”  Click-stream data helps us determine what is important to you and what is not.  It helps us decide what content and features to add and what to discard.  It also helps us determine whether our Site is easy to use or whether we need to redesign certain pages and links.  Click-stream data does not identify you personally. 

We also use technology to collect the following information and other information of a similar nature:  the name of your Internet service provider; your IP address; your operating system (Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and so on); and your browser type (Netscape, Internet Explorer, and so on).  We use this information to compile statistics about the technology used by our visitors.  These statistics help us improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. 

**Cookies.**   This Site uses certain software technology known as “cookies.”  Cookies are small text files that a web site places on a visitor’s computer browser to store certain information about the visitor, such as a visitor’s preferences.  Some web browsers provide you with the ability to turn off or refuse cookies.  However, if you turn off cookies or refuse cookies, some of the features of this Site may not function properly. 

**Links To Local Hockey Organization Web Pages Hosted On This Site.** This Site contains web pages that are controlled (at least in part) by local hockey organizations (e.g., local hockey associations, leagues or teams) that are affiliated with, but not controlled by, USAH.  Although USAH provides the tools and space for these local hockey organizations to post content on their web pages, subject to certain guidelines, these local organizations (and not USAH) control the content they post on or information they collect through their web pages.  USAH expressly disclaims any responsibility for the data practices of these local organizations or their web pages.  You should contact these organizations directly about any content posted on their web pages or to learn how they collect and use information collected through their web pages.
