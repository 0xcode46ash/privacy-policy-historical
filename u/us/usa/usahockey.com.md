We will use reasonable efforts to honor such requests.  You must understand, however, that even if you “opt-out,” you may still receive communications from our affiliated organizations or business partners, for example, if they received your contact information from another source or if they initiated the communication before we received your “opt-out” request.

We share personal information collected through our Sites with third party vendors who act for us or on our behalf, for example, to help us process or fill your orders, run promotions or provide other support services.  Our affiliates and our business partners may also share personal information with vendors who provide support services to them.  These vendors need information about you in order to perform their functions.  These vendors are not authorized to use the information we share with them (or that our affiliates and business partners share with them) for any purpose other than to provide services to us, our affiliates or our business partners.   

USAH has engaged certain third party service providers to perform services on behalf of USAH in connection with the management and operation of certain features of our Sites (including without limitation operation of our Store and our Sites’ registration functionality). As such, in connection with the Store, TMP will have access to and will use the personally identifiable information you provide in connection with your purchases on the Store, subject to the terms of USAH’s agreement with TMP. TMP may use your data for payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, website evaluation and data analysis.

In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer personal information in our databases to a third party, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect the security of our systems or service, or in the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.

 **Other Information Collected Through Our Sites.** We use technology that tells us how visitors use our Sites, for example, which pages they view, which links they use and which search terms they input.  This information is called “click-stream data.”  Click-stream data helps us determine what is important to you and what is not.  It helps us decide what content and features to add and what to discard.  It also helps us determine whether our Site is easy to use or whether we need to redesign certain pages and links.  Click-stream data does not identify you personally. 

We also use technology to collect the following information and other information of a similar nature:  the name of your Internet service provider; your IP address; your operating system (Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and so on); and your browser type (Netscape, Internet Explorer, and so on).  We use this information to compile statistics about the technology used by our visitors.  These statistics help us improve our Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors.

 **Cookies.** Our Sites uses certain software technology known as “cookies.”  Cookies are small text files that a web site places on a visitor’s computer browser to store certain information about the visitor, such as a visitor’s preferences.  Some web browsers provide you with the ability to turn off or refuse cookies.  However, if you turn off cookies or refuse cookies, some of the features of our Sites may not function properly. 

 **Links To Local Hockey Organization Web Pages Hosted On Our Sites.** Our Site located at usahockey.com contains web pages that are controlled (at least in part) by local hockey organizations (e.g., local hockey associations, leagues or teams) that are affiliated with, but not controlled by, USAH.  Although USAH provides the tools and space for these local hockey organizations to post content on their web pages, subject to certain guidelines, these local organizations (and not USAH) control the content they post on or information they collect through their web pages.  USAH expressly disclaims any responsibility for the data practices of these local organizations or their web pages.  You should contact these organizations directly about any content posted on their web pages or to learn how they collect and use information collected through their web pages.

 **Links to Other Web Sites.**   This privacy policy applies only to our Sites. These Sites contain links to other web sites, including those of advertisers and sponsors.  These other web sites have their own policies regarding privacy. We urge you to review the privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any personal information about yourself.  In addition, you may have linked to one of our Sites through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to one of our Sites through banner advertising on another site.  In such cases, the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

Security To protect your credit card number and other personal information when you shop in our Store, we use VeriSign SSL encryption technology. Your credit card number is digitally scrambled to ensure that is not read by unauthorized third parties. If you're still concerned about internet security, please contact our customer service department to submit your order by telephone or fax. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of any visitor information collected on our Sites, USAH and its vendors will have no liability for disclosure of any visitor information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

 **Transfer of Data Abroad.** If you are visiting our Sites from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located (currently the United States), the placing of an order in our Store, or other various communications may necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting our Sites and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.

 **Accessing and Updating Your Information.** You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into any of our Sites and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into the applicable account management section of usahockey.com or shopusahockey.com, however, on usahockeyregistration.com you can only update your e–mail address.

You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases; however, because we keep track of past purchases, we cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.
