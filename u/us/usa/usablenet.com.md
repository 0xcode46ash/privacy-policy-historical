**Types of Information Collected by Usablenet**

Usablenet collects anonymous information and, depending on how you choose to use our Site, may collect personal information. Anonymous information is information that may be collected by web browsers and servers, but that cannot be traced to a specific personal identity (for example, browser type, language preference, referring site, or the date and time of visitor requests). Usablenet may use this anonymous information to collect and publish aggregate statistics, including statistics about the behavior of its website visitors. Usablenet may store this information on its servers or elsewhere for an indefinite period of time. Personal information is information that can be used to establish the identity of an individual user (for example, your name, address or phone number). Other than as described below, Usablenet does not disclose personal information.

Usablenet uses cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for development of statistical information, and to improve user experience by tracking Site preferences. Usablenet does not collect any personal information through its use of cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Site, or to be notified as soon as cookies are sent. However, if you decide not to accept Usablenet’s cookies, certain features of the Site may not function optimally.
