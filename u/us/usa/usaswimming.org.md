_Revised July 29, 2002_

USA Swimming is a general audience website, with separate interactive features such as SwimKids geared towards audiences 12 and under.

As an interactive website, we collect certian personal information, which is more fully outlined below. 

While we encourage children to engage in our interactive website, we also wish to educate parents and kids about issues of privacy when visiting our site.

As a result, we are committed to full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). In compliance with COPPA, we collect from children only that information which is necessary for participation. In addition, we have provided parents with the ability to review the type of personal information currently collected about their children, to have that information deleted, and to request that no further personal information be collected by USA Swimming.

Information for parents can be found in the Parents section in the right hand sidebar on this page. Otherwise, the policies discussed below apply equally to children as well as to adults, except as when specifically stated otherwise.

USA Swimming respects and protects the privacy of our users. We encourage parents and kids to use and enjoy our website. Our privacy policy as described below is spelled out with the intention of educating parents and kids about how to safeguard their privacy when traveling on the web. We urge parents to discuss with their kids the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable information.
