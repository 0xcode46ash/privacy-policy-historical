** Please be sure to read our privacy policy when your child is using one of the interactive features on our site that may include the collection of personal information.

We have set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information.

| **POLICY  
**  
USA Swimming is a general audience website, with separate interactive features such as Age Group/SwimKids geared towards audiences 12 and under. 

As an interactive website, we collect certain personal information, which is more fully outlined below. 

While we encourage children to engage in our interactive website, we also wish to educate parents and kids about issues of privacy when visiting our site.

As a result, we are committed to full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). In compliance with COPPA, we collect from children only that information which is necessary for participation. In addition, we have provided parents with the ability to review the type of personal information currently collected about their children, to have that information deleted, and to request that no further personal information be collected by USA Swimming.

USA Swimming respects and protects the privacy of our users. We encourage parents and kids to use and enjoy our website. Our privacy policy as described below is spelled out with the intention of educating parents and kids about how to safeguard their privacy when surfing on the web. We urge parents to discuss with their children the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable information.
