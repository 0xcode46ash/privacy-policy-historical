# USA ePay : Privacy Policy

                           
**_Scope of this Privacy Policy_  
**This Privacy Policy covers USA ePay's treatment of personally identifiable information collected from merchants (hereafter "merchant" or "you") who use the USA ePay payment gateway services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business. This Policy also covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that USA ePay's business partners may share with it.

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that USA ePay does not own or control, or to people that USA ePay does not employ or manage. USA ePay is a wholly owned subsidiary of GorCorp, Inc. This Policy is specific to USA ePay and does not apply to other Web sites or Internet services that are part of the GorCorp Inc.

**_Information Collection and Use_  
**USA ePay collects personally identifiable information when you register for an USA ePay account, and when you use certain USA ePay products and services. USA ePay may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other business partners.

When you register with USA ePay, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and email address), as well as certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account and/or credit card number.

In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive information related to the transaction from the merchant or a financial institution. This normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished to the merchant or financial institution in the course of placing the order. We do not acquire any information directly from consumers through the www.usaepay.com Web site.

The personally identifiable information we acquire in processing payment transactions varies according to the nature of the transaction and the way in which merchants or financial institutions are using our payment services. It may include, for example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer's name, credit card number and expiration date or checking account number, billing address, and shipping address.

USA ePay uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for products and/or services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway services. We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials and new products. Personally identifiable consumer information is only used to process payment transactions and is never used for any other purpose.

USA ePay does not offer services or sell products to children. USA ePay does not request or knowingly collect personally identifiable contact information from anyone under the age of 13.

**_Information Sharing and Disclosure  
_**Protecting personally identifiable information about merchants and consumers is an important part of our business. We share and disclose such information only as described below.

USA ePay will only send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 1) we have your consent to share the information; 2) we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 3) we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of USA ePay to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide them beyond what is necessary to assist us).

Personally identifiable consumer information is shared with third parties (such as banks and credit card processors) to the extent necessary for USA ePay to deliver payment processing services.

We also may release personally identifiable information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Merchant Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of USA ePay, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction.

In the unlikely event that USA ePay is acquired, merchant account information may be one of the transferred assets.

**_Information Security_  
**Information security is critical to our business. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We store information gathered on secure computers located in a locked data center. The number of employees involved in the management of the data center that have physical access to these computers is limited. We use firewalls and other security technology to prevent our computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons.

We also require that all personally identifiable consumer information sent to us by you be encrypted using SSL encryption. To learn more about SSL, go to: <http://wp.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html> .

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your Login ID/password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer and otherwise protect the password used to access USA ePay services.

**_Account Information and Preferences_  
**USA ePay gives you the ability to edit your USA ePay Account Information and preferences at any time by using the Settings option in your Merchant Console, or by emailing us at [support@usaepay.com](mailto:support@usaepay.com) .

**_Notice for European Users_  
**USA ePay is located in the United States. Any information that you provide to USA ePay will be transferred out of the EU to the United States. By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described herein.

**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_  
**USA ePay reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. If there are material changes to this statement or in how USA ePay will use personally identifiable information, USA ePay will post notice on the USA ePay news release page at www.usaepay.com prior to implementing the change.
