# USA NETWORK I Privacy Policy

#### OVERALL PRIVACY STATEMENT

Your privacy on the Internet is of utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of USANetwork.com, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. 

Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices, and periodically reviews its practices for compliance to accepted Internet standards. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. 

When you visit USANetwork.com you can expect to be informed about: 

  1. What information USANetwork.com gathers/tracks about you 
  2. What USANetwork.com does with the information it gathers/tracks 
  3. With whom USANetwork.com shares the information it gathers/tracks 
  4. USANetwork.com's deleting policy 
  5. USANetwork.com's policy on correcting or updating personally identifiable information 



Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the attention of USANetwork.com's Database Marketing Coordinator at [webmaster@usanetwork.com](mailto:webmaster@usanetwork.com?subject=Attention:%20Database%20Marketing%20Coordinator). 

USANetwork.com is operated by Universal Television Networks, part of the Universal Television Group ([www.universalstudios.com](http://www.universalstudios.com/)), a division of Vivendi Universal Entertainment (VUE). 

#### INFORMATION USANETWORK.COM GATHERS/TRACKS 

USANetwork.com gathers data about users from three different sources. First, through optional, voluntary registration; second through optional, voluntary participation in certain contests and sweepstakes; and third through merchandise purchase transactions where delivery to home addresses is required. Additionally, users are aggregated for tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site, logging IP addresses, and browser type. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because USANetwork.com derives revenue from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. The only situation in which USA Network divulges information about an individual user to a third party is with certain sponsored contests and sweepstakes where a third party is involved. 

USANetwork.com gathers user information in the following processes: 

  1. USANetwork.com offers free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, users can enter special areas of the site such as gaming areas and selected members-only chats. During registration the user is required to supply a username ("handle"), password and e-mail address. They may also be asked to answer mandatory survey questions including, age, gender, education, and USA Network availability. 

Sometimes during registration the user has the option of supplying first name, last name, mailing address, income, marital status, employment status and other demographic/psychographic queries.

  2.  **Various Periodic Surveys/Polls**  
Occasionally USANetwork.com conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. USANetwork.com offers interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the USANetwork.com audience thinks about relevant issues.
  3.  **Various Periodic Sweepstakes/Contests/Promotions For Prizes**   
USANetwork.com offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name, address, daytime telephone number and email address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. There are two situations in which USANetwork.com will divulge this information to a third party--provided the user gives express consent: 
    1. A user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser. 
    2. Some of the contests may be hosted on the USANetwork.com site but administered by the sponsor; in such cases, the information a user provides is passed on to the third party as long as that user gives express consent. 
  
Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. 
  4. **Merchandise Purchasers**  
USANetwork.com users who decide to purchase products within the USANetwork.com web site are required to provide information that will ensure the transaction can be completed in a secure environment. The required information to complete the transaction includes, but is not limited to, full name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card information. 



####  USE OF THE INFORMATION THIS SITE GATHERS/TRACKS

The information that is gathered on each of the data entry forms throughout the site, as described above, is utilized to better understand and serve the needs of the USA Network viewing community. The site does this by building a community database that provides individual and overall demographic and psychographic profiles. The site will also utilize information gathered to build member profiles, to allow for identification of and provide the ability to contact our best customers. Additionally, the site may, in the future, utilize the opt-in features to provide community members with news and information on new content, products and features of the site via direct contact of electronic mail. 

Access to our servers and server logs is restricted to authorized personnel who are responsible for upholding this privacy policy. 

####  SHARING OF THE INFORMATION THIS SITE GATHERS/TRACKS 

The postal address information gathered on merchandise purchasers is shared with external third party shippers. These shippers only use the postal address to fulfill the transaction. Additionally, sponsored third party sweepstakes, contests or promotions where demographic information is gathered is shared with the third party for marketing purposes. 

The information gathered beyond name, e-mail address, age, gender, education and USA Network availability is optional except in the case of sweepstakes/contests, where further information is needed for fulfillment. All other information gathered within this site is optional and NOT shared with ANY external third party.
