# Privacy and Security: USA.gov

USA.gov doesn't collect personal information when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information.

  


## Information Collected and Stored Automatically

When you visit USA.gov, we may store some or all of the following: the Internet address from which you access USA.gov, date and time, the Internet address of the web site from which you linked to USA.gov, the name of the file or words you searched, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. 

This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the site more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. USA.gov periodically deletes its Web logs. On occasion, USA.gov may provide this information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes of research analysis. 

  


## Cookies

When you visit some websites, their web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies. Cookies are commonly used to recognize your computer in the future.

USA.gov uses per-session cookies to serve technical purposes, like providing seamless navigation through USA.gov. Our customer satisfaction survey uses session cookies to ensure you are only invited to take a survey once during your visit. These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer's hard drive. USA.gov's session cookies are only available during an active browser session. When you close your browser, the session cookie disappears.

Our customer satisfaction survey uses a persistent cookie that is stored on your computer’s hard drive. This cookie ensures that we won’t invite you to take a customer satisfaction survey within 90 days of completing a survey on USA.gov. You can [opt-out of persistent cookies](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml "opt-out of persistent cookies") by adjusting the settings on your web browser. By opting-out of the persistent cookie set by USA.gov’s customer satisfaction survey, your experience browsing USA.gov will be unaffected except that you may be invited to complete our satisfaction survey more often than we normally serve it to our visitors. 

  


## If You Send Us Personal Information

We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to your request. The only personal information that we collect is what you decide to give us by placing an order for our catalog, ordering publications from our catalog, or sending us an e-mail. If you choose to provide us with personal information — like filling out a Contact Us form, with an e-mail address and ZIP code, and submitting it to us through the website — we use that information to respond to your message, and to help get you the information you requested. Similarly, if you order a publication from us, we will collect your name, and mailing address to fulfill your order. 

We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. USA.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing.

  


## Site Security

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.

Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
