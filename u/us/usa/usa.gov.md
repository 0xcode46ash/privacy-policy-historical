# Privacy and Security: USA.gov

[Home](https://web.archive.org/index.shtml) > Privacy and Security 

Official information and services from the U.S. government

USA.gov does not collect any personal information when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information. The USA.gov privacy policy is as follows:

  


### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

When you visit the USA.gov web site, we may store some or all of the following: the Internet address from which you access the web site, date and time, the Internet address of the web site from which you linked to our site, the name of the file or words you searched, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us expand the coverage of the site, to analyze patterns of usage, and to make the site more useful. However, this information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. USA.gov periodically deletes its Web logs. On occasion, USA.gov may provide this information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes of research analysis. 

  


### Cookies

When you visit some websites, their web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies. Some cookies collect personal information to recognize your computer in the future.

USA.gov uses per-session cookies to serve technical purposes, like providing seamless navigation through USA.gov. These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer's hard drive. USA.gov's per-session cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. When you close your browser, the per-session cookie disappears.

  


### If You Send Us Personal Information

We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you (for example, to respond to your questions or provide subscriptions you have chosen). If you choose to provide us with personal information—like filling out a Contact Us form, with an e-mail address and zip code, and submitting it to us through the website—we use that information to respond to your message, and to help get you the information you've requested. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. USA.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing.

While you must provide an e-mail address and zip code for a localized response to any incoming questions or comments to USA.gov, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal information, especially Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration offers additional [guidance](http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html#giving "guidance") on sharing your Social Security number.

  


### Site Security

  * For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
  * Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
  * Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
