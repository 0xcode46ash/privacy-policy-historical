###### What information is collected?

Usabilla Live may collect a variety of information, such as user data when a user / visitor participates in one of Usabilla Live’s services (“User”). This can be for example when a User gives feedback with the Usabilla Live feedback button or participates in an exit survey. We will store the input given by the User (e.g. feedback rating, comment). The type of information stored solely depends on what the “owner” of the feedback button wants to know from his / her User / Visitor and what information is subsequently provided. Users are responsible for the personal information they choose to share or submit in these instances. However, measures can be taken to ensure that website Users’ sensitive data remains confidential when utilizing the feedback button. The following options are available within the Usabilla Live tool:

● Mask (completely black out) sensitive parts of the website, so it won’t be included in screenshots.   
● Scramble content on the website completely illegible for the sake of upholding client confidentiality.   
● Completely exclude screenshots from the feedback solution.   
● Exclude IP-addresses from being logged.

All actions taken in the above described measures are performed on the client’s end. This prevents privacy sensitive data from reaching the Usabilla servers. Furthermore, Usabilla automatically collects meta information when a User participates in one of Usabilla Live’s services, or when a Visitor visits the Usabilla website (“Visitor”). For example, Usabilla may log browser information (such as IP Address, browser type, operating system, viewport, language [and web pages visited]), and mobile device information]. This Usabilla website includes Social Media Features. These Features may collect a variety of information, such as IP Address, pages visited on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly (Our Cookie Policy is available at: usabilla.com/cookie-policy). These Features are hosted by a third party hosted directly on our website. Interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

###### How is the information is used?

The information that Usabilla collects may be used in aggregate form in various ways to optimize and improve Usabilla’s services. Usabilla may use this information for website management, administration and security, promotional activities, and research and analysis. Information will not identify Users / Visitors personally. The information collected because of use of Usabilla Live’s services, is only available to Users with access to their Usabilla Live account with their username and password. None of the information collected will be made available publicly. All information within the Usabilla Live account is exportable as Microsoft Excel format. It is the responsibility of the Usabilla Live account holder to handle these exports with care. 

###### How is information protected?

Usabilla uses reasonable measures to protect the information stored within Usabilla’s databases, and Usabilla restricts access to such information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as customer service personnel and technical staff. Usabilla has adopted physical, technological, and administrative measures to safeguard and secure the information.

Usabilla Live accounts are secured by a user created password, in which case reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that account information is kept private. The Usabilla Live account holder is responsible for keeping this password confidential and changing the password periodically. 

All data transactions between the Usabilla Live users and the Usabilla Live infrastructure will be encrypted by using SSL technology. Despite these efforts, please note that Usabilla cannot ensure or guarantee the security of information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information at any time. Usabilla does not accept liability for unintentional entry, use, or disclosure of information. 

###### Sharing of information

Usabilla does not rent, sell, or share personal information of Users / Visitors with other people or non-affiliated companies (e.g. for direct marketing purposes), unless Usabilla has a Users’ / Visitors’ permission. 

Usabilla may, however, share non personal aggregated information with third parties. For example, Usabilla may share an aggregated overview of the number of feedback items or number of feedback buttons being displayed to business partners. Because this form of data does not identify particular Users, these third parties will not be able to contact those Users based solely on this data. 

Usabilla shares personal information with companies who provide services (such as information processing or providing customer service). These service providers are obliged to protect that information.

It may be necessary (e.g. by law, litigation, or requests from governmental bodies) for Usabilla to disclose certain personal information. Usabilla may also disclose information if Usabilla determines it necessary or opportune for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance. Usabilla may also disclose information if Usabilla determines that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce Usabilla’s terms and conditions or protect Usabilla’s operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a restructuring, merger, or sale Usabilla may transfer any and all personal information Usabilla collects and has collected to the relevant third party.

###### Retention

Usabilla will retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
