# Privacy Policy - Usabilla

  


## 1 What information is collected?

Usabilla Live collects user data when a user / visitor participates in one of Usabilla Live’s services. This can be for example when a user gives feedback with the Usabilla Live feedback button or participates in an exit survey. We will store the input given by the user (e.g. feedback rating, comment). The type of information stored solely depends on what the “owner” of the feedback button wants to know from his / her visitors.

Furthermore we will automatically collect meta information when a user / visitor participates in one of Usabilla Live’s services. For example, Usabilla may log information from your browser, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, view port and language. By using Usabilla Live, you are giving Usabilla permission to use and store such information consistent with this privacy policy.

## 2 How is the information is used?

The information collected is only available to users with access to their Usabilla Live account with their username and password. None of the information collected is available publicly. All information within the Usabilla Live account is exportable as Microsoft Excel format. It is the responsibility of the Usabilla Live account holder to handle these exports with care.

## 3 How is information protected?

Usabilla Live accounts are secured by a user created password, in which case reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that your account information is kept private. The Usabilla Live account holder is responsible for keeping this password confidential and changing the password periodically. Usabilla uses reasonable measures to protect the information stored within our databases, and we restrict access to such information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.

All data transactions between the Usabilla Live users and the Usabilla Live infrastructure will be encrypted by using SSL technology.

Despite these efforts, please note that we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of your information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of your information at any time.
