# Privacy Policy / Terms and Conditions (for online buying of gold coins)

**_Privacy Policy_**

This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for USAGOLD and applies solely to information collected through this web site.

**Information Collection, Use, and (Non)Sharing**  
We only have access to/collect the limited information that you voluntarily give us via submittal of request or order forms, email or other direct contact from you. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We do not and will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization -- other than as necessary to fulfill your request (e.g. to ship an order.) We will use your information to provide the service you requested or to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about related specials or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

**Your Access to and Control Over Information**  
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number provided below:

\-- Inquire what data we have about you, if any.  
\-- Change/correct/delete any data we have about you.  
\-- Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at (303)393-0322 or via email at admin@usagold.com

**Security**  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive billing information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us through our secure cart server (cart.usagold.com). You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon in your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the cart's checkout/billing page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store any such personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and recommend they read the privacy statements of any other site that may seek to collect personally identifiable information.
