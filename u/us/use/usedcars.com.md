# UsedCars.com - Privacy Policy

**Our General Policies And Practices**

As Web users ourselves, we understand the importance of online privacy. And we are committed to respecting yours. 

We exist to help people find used cars. In order to operate, we need to gather and supply personal information about prospective car buyers. We are committed to responsible handling of the information you provide us. This means that we will not abuse it and will use it only as outlined below. It also means that we will supply it through business relationships only to auto retailing network partners whose privacy policies are equally respectful of your rights. 

**About The Process You Are Using**

Dealix Corp. ("we") operate a system which introduces used car shoppers to used car retailers or retail networks. This system can appear to the shopping consumer ("you") in one of two ways. 

First, it can appear as the branded site "UsedCars.com". This site is owned, controlled, and operated in its entirety by us. 

Second, it can appear as a used car buying service on a Web site owned, controlled, and operated by an entity other than us. In this case, the buying service may be identified as "powered by UsedCars.com", "powered by Dealix", or neither. 

In any case, the buying service itself (hereafter referred to as "the Process" or "we"), regardless of where you find it and how it is identified, is owned, controlled, and operated by us. This Privacy Policy covers the gathering and use of information identifiable to you which is performed by the Process. The information here is equally applicable regardless of how or where you encounter the Process. 

**Information Collected Without Action On Your Part**

We use your IP address, collected automatically by our Web servers, to analyze our traffic sources and to discourage fraudulent use of the Process. This information does not identify you personally. 

The Process places "cookies" on your hard drive. Cookies are small amounts of textual information which allow the Process to work better for you by storing information such as the vehicle you’re currently configuring, etc. These cookies are only used by the Process during the time you’re in the Process. We don’t collect them or use them in other ways. If you don’t like the fact that cookies are placed on your hard drive by our Process or any other Web site, you can set your browser preferences so that you don’t accept cookies, or only accept them on demand. 

“As an online advertiser, we are looking for better, more targeted and less intrusive forms of advertising and as such have partnered with several companies that collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Additionally, we use this technology to advertise this site’s products and services. If you would like to find out more information regarding this practice and to opt-out of this information collection method, please visit the following sites.

**Information Collected Through Action On Your Part**

If you ask to be introduced to an auto dealer or dealer network through our Process, we need you to voluntarily provide your name, email address, phone number, and other information to make the introduction possible. This information will be stored in our databases and may be used to email you a follow-up survey regarding your experience. It may also be used to send you information regarding changes to our services. You may opt out of receiving such notices by emailing your request to removeme@dealix.com. We will also provide your information to the retailer or retail network to whom we’re introducing you. The retailer or retail network will then use the information to contact you regarding your vehicle request. 

Our own contracted retailers, identified as “UsedCars.com Network Retailers”, will use the information to communicate with you regarding the vehicle you are seeking. The use of the information by other retail networks is governed by the privacy policy of the network which receives the information. This network is clearly identified to you when you submit the information. We aren’t responsible for individual networks’ policies or practices. 

**Other Ways In Which We Use Collected Information**

We may share generalized information about our customers or traffic sources with our business partners. This does not include any information through which you can be personally identified. 

If we are required by law through court order or subpoena to release personal information, we will comply. This has never occurred in the history of our company and we consider the possibility of this occurring in the future to be remote. 

**General Information**

We will never supply your personal information to any of our retail channels without first identifying the channel to you and allowing you to choose not to proceed. If you do proceed, any use of your information beyond that point is solely governed by the privacy policy of the identified partner. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of external partners. 

We reserve the right to change or amend this Privacy Policy at any time in response to changing business needs. Please check regularly for updates which may affect your use of Dealix services.
