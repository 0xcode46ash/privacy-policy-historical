# Privacy Policy | U.S. Kids Golf

##### At U.S. Kids Golf, your privacy is our priority.

You value your privacy. And we respect that. When you shop with [www.uskidsgolf.com](http://www.uskidsgolf.com/), we need to collect a certain amount of information about you to make shopping easier for you--and for us. We believe that you have a right to know how we use that information and how we keep it secure.

##### What information do we collect?

When you order from our website, we need to know information such as your name, e-mail address, billing address and phone number, and credit card number so we can process and fill your order and contact you if we have any questions.  If you register your child for a tournament, we need their name and birth date information as well as emergency contact information.

When you visit our website, we automatically collect information such as which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site. This information is anonymous--meaning we cannot identify you personally--unless you identify yourself, for example, by making a purchase or by creating an account.

Now and then, we may conduct surveys, run contests or other promotions. If you choose to participate in one of our surveys or contests, we'll probably ask for some personal information such as your shopping habits, e-mail address and other information so we can run the promotion and notify winners.

##### How do we use the information?

When you place an order on our website, we use your information to process and fill your order. We may send you an e-mail to confirm or to update you on your order. We may also need to contact you by regular mail, e-mail or phone if we have any questions about your order.

When you order, create an account, complete a survey or participate in a contest or promotion on our website, we'll use the information to send e-mail or regular mail to you about our products, services or other contests and promotions you might be interested in, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive such mail.

We maintain the information that you provide us, along with a record of your purchases, in a database. To best serve you, we may combine this information with data that is publicly available and data that we collect at our marketing events, at our tournaments, or receive from other business partners and/or reputable sources whose policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards.

Also, we may, from time to time, review your information and information of other customers to help us analyze trends, purchasing patterns and preferences, and demographics.

##### Do we share your information with third parties?

We share your information with our trusted third party service providers who manage our website. These third parties provide specific services and administer activities offered at our website; for example, customer service and credit card processing. These third parties are not authorized to discuss, disclose or make any use of your personal information except as necessary to provide such services.

We or our third party service providers may disclose specific individual information if we or they reasonably believe that it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations or to protect the interests of U.S. Kids Golf LLC, U.S. Kids Golf Foundation, or the interests of our third party service providers.

##### How can you Unsubscribe or change your information?

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from U.S. Kids Golf or would like to update or change your personal information or preferences, please follow the instructions below.

##### Registration Information, Preferences, E-mail subscriptions

To modify or delete the information you have provided during registration, please login and update your profile. Please note that your request to be removed from our e-mail lists might take up to ten (10) business days to become effective (regular mailing lists may take up to 4-6 weeks). Even if you're removed from a list, if you order online, we will send you an e-mail to confirm your order and may need to contact you by phone, e-mail or regular mail if we have questions about your order.

##### How do we protect the privacy of children?

We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this website directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18 unless you have signed them up for a tournament. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.

##### How do we use cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information such as recognizing you when you return to our website and remembering the items in your Shopping Bag. Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies; you can usually change your browser settings to refuse cookies but you may experience difficulties while shopping online at [www.uskidsgolf.com](http://www.uskidsgolf.com/).  U.S. Kids Golf and our trusted third-party providers use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our site and understand your preferences based on previous or current site visits so that we can offer better site experiences and services in the future.

##### Consent

By using our website, you're agreeing to let us collect and use your information as we describe in this Privacy Policy. If we change our policies, we will post any changes on the website, so that you are always informed about what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
