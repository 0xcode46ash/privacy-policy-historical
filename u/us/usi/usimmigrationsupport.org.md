U.S. Immigration Support is committed to protecting our clients' privacy. U.S. Immigration Support only uses the information we collect to process orders requested by our clients. As a visitor to our website, you have the right to understand our information privacy practices. We understand that submitting your information over the Internet involves a great deal of trust on your part and we take this trust very seriously. Our highest priority is to ensure the security and confidentiality of our clients' personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, email address and credit card details. Please review our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20110218101015id_/http%3A//www.usimmigrationsupport.org/terms.html) page for more information. 

**What Information We Collect**  
We do not collect any personal information by you browsing our website. If you choose to order any of our products or services, you must voluntarily provide us with your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Once an order is placed, we provide tracking through FEDEX for hard copy products, and we record your IP address, time and date for downloadable products. Your information is not shared with any person, business or organization. No credit card information is stored on our servers. U.S. Immigration Support uses Authorize.net to process credit card transactions. Authorize.net is a leading provider of payment gateway services making it able for customers to purchase products online. Authorize.net will never use your personal information for any other reason. For statistical purposes we have installed Google Analytics. Visit our [Business and Website Certifications](https://web.archive.org/web/20110218101015id_/http%3A//www.usimmigrationsupport.org/certifications.html) section for more information.

**Cookies**  
A third party cookie server places cookies on our website in order to collect and provides us with basic website analytics, such as unique visitors, pages views, entry pages, exit pages, search engine referring information, and other general website information. No Personally Identifiable Information [PII] is collected. 

**Use of Your Data**  
The information you voluntarily provide to us is only used to process your order. User data is never disclosed to any third parties unless as otherwise disclosed in this privacy statement.

**Security**  
Our shopping cart includes a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to protect our customers’ information when shopping online. SSL technology encrypts the customers’ name, address, and credit card information between your computer and our server. We work closely with Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover to eliminate any fraudulent transactions. It is easy to see that your connection is secure as the URL of your website will change from http:// to https:// indicating that the connection is secure during the check-out process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
