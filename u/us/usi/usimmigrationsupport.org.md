We do not collect any personal information by you browsing our website. If you choose to order any of our products or services, you must voluntarily provide us with your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Once an order is placed, we provide tracking through FEDEX for hard copy products, and we record your IP address, time and date for downloadable products. Your information is not shared with any person, business or organization. No credit card information is stored on our servers. U.S. Immigration Support uses Authorize.net to process credit card transactions.

**Cookies**  
A third party cookie server places cookies on our website in order to collect and provides us with basic website analytics, such as unique visitors, pages views, entry pages, exit pages, search engine referring information, and other general website information.

SSL technology encrypts the customers’ name, address, and credit card information between your computer and our server. We work closely with Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover to eliminate any fraudulent transactions. It is easy to see that your connection is secure as the URL of your website will change from http:// to https:// indicating that the connection is secure during the check-out process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
