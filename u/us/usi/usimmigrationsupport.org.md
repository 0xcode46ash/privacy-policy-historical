As a visitor to our website, you have the right to understand our information privacy practices. We understand that submitting your information over the Internet involves a great deal of trust on your part and we take this trust very seriously. Our highest priority is to ensure the security and confidentiality of our clients' personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, email address and credit card details. Please review our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20150321120427id_/http%3A//www.usimmigrationsupport.org/terms.html) page for more information. 

**What Information We Collect**  
We do not collect any personal information by you browsing our website. If you choose to order any of our products or services, you must voluntarily provide us with your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Once an order is placed, we provide tracking through FEDEX for hard copy products, and we record your IP address, time and date for downloadable products. Your information is not shared with any person, business or organization. No credit card information is stored on our servers. U.S. Immigration Support uses Authorize.net to process credit card transactions. Authorize.net is a leading provider of payment gateway services making it able for customers to purchase products online. Authorize.net will never use your personal information for any other reason. For statistical purposes we have installed Google Analytics.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.

Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. With cookies diabled you may not be able to submit your order. 

**Use of Your Data**  
The information you voluntarily provide to us is only used to process your order. User data is never disclosed to any third parties unless as otherwise disclosed in this privacy statement. We disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, to any other third party with your prior consent to do so. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Us Immigration Support. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. 

**Data Retention**  
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [info@usimmigrationsupport.org](mailto:info@usimmigrationsupport.org?subject=My%20information). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may do the following: correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it, by contacting our customer service department at [info@usimmigrationsupport.org](mailto:info@usimmigrationsupport.org?subject=My%20information)

**Security**  
Our shopping cart includes a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to protect our customers’ information when shopping online. SSL technology encrypts the customers’ name, address, and credit card information between your computer and our server. We work closely with Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover to eliminate any fraudulent transactions. It is easy to see that your connection is secure as the URL of your website will change from http:// to https:// indicating that the connection is secure during the check-out process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
