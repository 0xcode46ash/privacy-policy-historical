| Privacy Policy  
---  
USInsuranceOnline.com has written up a privacy policy to protect your interests. Below are our guidelines to how we protect and share your information that you submit on our site.

USInsuranceOnline.com does not sell insurance online. We will provide you a service so you can get free insurance quotes. The insurance professionals that provide you with your free quotes compensate us. This will give you options to see products and prices from different insurance companies.   
  
Why do we request personal information?  
USInsuranceOnline.com collects your personal information so that our insurance professionals can get you the quote that you request. The more information you provide the more accurate the quote.  
Sharing of Personal Information

You also authorize these insurance professionals to contact you via email, fax, and telephone regardless of your phone number being on any no-call list for the purpose of delivering your requested quotes.  
Use of Email Addresses  
We hate SPAM and we know you do too. We only use the email address you provide when requesting a quote for the purposes of delivering your requested quotes and occasionally sending you follow-up correspondence directly relating to your quote request. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your email address for any other purpose. Further, you will always have the opportunity to opt out of any additional email correspondence at will. All correspondence we send via email is guaranteed to be 100% CAN SPAM compliant.
