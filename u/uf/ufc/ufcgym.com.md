# UFC Gym | The Ultimate Fitness Destination | Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**  
Welcome to the ufcgymspecialoffers.com website. This website is owned and operated by Combattimento Gymnasiums, LLC d/b/a UFC Gym (which may be referred to herein as “we”, “our”, or “us”). We want ufcgymspecialoffers.com to be your source for fitness information, products, services and tools. Your privacy as you use our website is important to us. This privacy policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it.

Information We Gather  
Personally Identifiable Information**  
We may collect information from you when you register with ufcgym.com (and in other areas of ufcgym.com) such as the following: your name, e-mail address, user ID, password, telephone number, physical address, birth date, gender, zip code and UFC Gym membership number. This information is personally identifiable information and it allows us to contact you and distinguish you from other users.  
You may buy various products and services on our website. When you make purchases through ufcgym.com, we gather information such as what you are purchasing, your method of payment, and your billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history and to facilitate future orders. This information may also be used for aggregate reporting (which summarizes the data in a report which does not contain your personally identifiable information).  
We may provide fitness tracking tools which allow you to save information so that you can track your workouts, nutrition or other private information about yourself. We may store your fitness tracking information on our servers in order to provide you with these tools. We may also use that information to provide you with other services through our website. Once we separate your fitness tracking information from your personally identifiable information, so that it cannot be linked back to you, we may use the aggregated information for other purposes.  
You may have the opportunity to enter certain sweepstakes and contests which require registration with ufcgym.com. If you enter a ufcgym.com contest, we record your entry and link it to your ufcgym.com registration information. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery and related purposes.  
We may receive additional personally identifiable information from you through communications with ufcgym.com. For example, if you e-mail ufcgym.com to ask about a product or service, we will use that information to respond to your inquiry, to have a history of our service to you and to make better our service by reporting your request, without any personally identifying information, in our customer service totals.
