# University of Florida - Web Administration: Internet Privacy Policy

#### Internet Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the University of Florida. Our policy is to collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our Web sites unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available to us. However, our Web servers do automatically recognize some non-personal information such as volume and timing of access as well as the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed our sites.

If you choose to share personal information with us, we will not sell that information to commercial entities. Some information must be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Florida's records retention policies and may be released if required by the Florida's Public Records Law. Most student information is kept confidential pursuant to the federal and state Buckley Amendments.

If you have questions about our privacy policy, or have ideas about improving our policy, please feel free to e-mail us at [webadmin@aa.ufl.edu](mailto:webadmin@aa.ufl.edu). You can also reach us by telephone at (352) 392-3753.
