### University of Houston Interim Privacy Policy

The [Division of Information Technology](https://web.archive.org/infotech/) maintains the University of Houston Web site as a public service. The following is the privacy policy for this site (all pages - but not all links - starting with www.uh.edu):

  * We do not use cookies to collect information on the UH Central Web server (www.uh.edu). Some links from this server may be to other servers that use cookies. Note: A cookie file contains unique information a web site can use to track such things as passwords, lists of pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page or to identify your session at a particular web site. A cookie is often used in commercial sites to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart application.

  * If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that sends us this information, we will only use the personally-identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.

  * For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings. 

  * We use log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. Our monthly statistics page is available at: <http://www.uh.edu/stats/www/stats.html>.
