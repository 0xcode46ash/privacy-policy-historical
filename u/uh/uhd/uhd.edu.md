# Privacy Statement​ | University of Houston-Downtown

Thank you for visiting the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) website. UHD is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of confidential information. As a public institution of higher education, we do not actively share personal information collected via interaction with our web servers. UHD will not disclose personal information about visitors to the web site to anyone outside of the university unless we are required to do so by law.

Typically, we do not use cookies to collect information on the UHD Web server ([www.uhd.edu](http://www.uhd.edu/)). However, the Customize Quick Links feature does use cookies to store user preference settings.

Note: A cookie file contains unique information a website can use to track such things as passwords, lists of pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page or to identify your session at a particular website. A cookie is often used in commercial sites to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart application.

If you send us an email message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that sends us this information, we will only use the personally-identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.

For site management functions, information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.

We use log analysis tools to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

Extensive security measures have been employed by the university to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. These security measures are consistent with the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Information Security Standards.
