# UHEAA - Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY NOTICE**

**UTAH HIGHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY,  
A SUBSIDIARY OF THE UTAH STATE BOARD OF REGENTS**

Protecting the privacy of your personal information is important to us at the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority (UHEAA). We respect your right to privacy and recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and confidential. We do not sell or otherwise share information about you with outside marketers.

Recent federal legislation requires us to give you this notice about our privacy policy. The law also requires us to provide you with a copy of this notice each year that you are our customer.

This notice uses the term "nonpublic personal information." This means personal information about you which identifies you, and that is not available from public sources. This notice also uses the term "as permitted by law." This means that nonpublic personal information may be shared as necessary in the normal course of business to certify, process, make, guarantee, administer or service your loan, trust account, loan forgiveness, or scholarship.

This Privacy Policy applies to programs administered by UHEAA, a subsidiary of the Utah State Board of Regents (SBR). Current programs covered by the policy include the following:

Utah Student Loan Guarantee Program (LGP)  
SBR Loan Purchase Program (LPP)  
Utah Educational Savings Plan Trust (UESP)  
Utah Engineering and Technology Loan Forgiveness Program  
UHEAA Scholarships

The UHEAA Privacy Policy 

1\. We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

a. Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;  
b. Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and  
c. Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.

2\. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. 

3\. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know such information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.
