At Umbel, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers as well as protecting data that our customers provide to us in the course of providing services to you. This Privacy Policy serves to explain how Umbel uses your data collected through the services and products available at or through Umbel’s website (collectively, the “Website”). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “Users” shall mean your customers, subscribers, end-users or individuals who join your organization’s social networking groups.

## Policy Coverage

Umbel’s Privacy Policy covers the treatment of both non-personally-identifying and personally-identifying information of your Users that Umbel receives from you through the Website. Umbel does not gather any non-personally-identifying and personally-identifying information of your Users. We only have access to information that you have legally and properly collected from your Users (in accordance with your own Privacy Policy) and that you provide to us for purposes of the Umbel services. Therefore, this Privacy Policy applies only to User information that you provide to us through the Website and any Social Networking Sites to which you have us link your Umbel account.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Umbel does not own or control, or to individuals that Umbel does not employ or manage. In addition, the Website may contain links to outside sources. While we attempt to provide links only to those sites that share our respect for your privacy and the privacy of your Users, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any web sites you visit.

## Aggregated Statistics

Umbel provides statistics about the behavior and preferences of your Users. More specifically, Umbel provides aggregated anonymized information resulting from the analysis of your User data by conducting industry, traffic and demographic analysis. Umbel will not display this information publicly or provide it to third parties without your express permission.

## Protection of User Personally-Identifying Information You Provide to Umbel

Umbel takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information of your Users.  Umbel discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Umbel’s behalf or to provide services available at Umbel’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.  Umbel will not rent or sell your Users’ potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Umbel discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Umbel believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Umbel, third parties or the public at large.

## Business Transfers

If Umbel, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Umbel goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Umbel may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
