### UITV Privacy Policy

The UITV Privacy Policy describes how UITV and its subsidiaries treat personal information when you use UITV services, including information provided when you use UITV.

In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to UITV. Personal Information Browsing UiTV You can watch videos on UiTV without having a UiTV Account. You can also contact us through the UiTV Help Centre or by emailing us at [marketing@uitvconnect.com ](http://mailto:marketing@uitvconnect.com/) directly, without having to register for an account.

Your UiTV Account. For some activities on UiTV, such as uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos or watching restricted videos, you need a UiTV Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorised access. Usage Information.

When you use UiTV, we may record information about your usage of the site, such as the channels, groups and favourites to which you subscribe, which other users you communicate with, the videos that you watch, the frequency and size of data transfers and information that you display about yourself, as well as information that you click in UiTV (including UI elements, settings).

If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your UiTV Account. In order to ensure the quality of our service to you, we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications with you in order to confirm delivery. Content Uploaded to Site.

Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g. video comments, your profile page) may be collected and used by others.

If you download the UiTV Uploader, your copy includes a unique application number. This number and information about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will be sent to UiTV when the Uploader automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.

**Uses**

If you submit personal information to UiTV, we may use that information to operate, maintain and improve the features and functionality of UiTV, and to process any flagging activity or other communication that you send to us.

We do not use your email address or other personal information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent.

We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major UiTV changes or for customer service purposes).

You can also choose how often UiTV sends you email updates in your UiTV Account settings page.

**Information**

That is Publicly Available When you create a UiTV Account, some information about your UiTV Account and your account activity will be provided to other users of UiTV. This may include the date that you opened your UiTV Account, the date that you last logged in to your UiTV Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country and the number of videos that you have watched.

Your UiTV Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on UiTV, such as when you upload videos or send messages through UiTV.

Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment on the site.

Any videos that you submit to UiTV may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by other UiTV users or the general public.

You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be visible to other users on your UiTV Account channel page. If you choose to add certain features to your UiTV Account channel page, then these features and your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be aggregated and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may include your favourite videos, videos that you rated and videos that you have uploaded.

**Your Choices**

If you have a UiTV Account, you may update or correct your personal profile information, email preferences and privacy settings at any time by visiting your UiTV account profile page.

You may control the information that is available to other users and your confirmed friends at any time by editing your UiTV Account and the features that are included on your channel page.

You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through UITV, in which case you can still view videos and explore UITV, but UITV may not be able to provide certain services to you.

Some advanced UITV features may use other services such as Paypal or AdSense. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information associated with them.
