 **Introduction**

The Ubokia.com website (the " **Site** ") is operated by Ubokia.com, Inc. (" **Ubokia** "). Ubokia is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our users and others who visit and use the Site (individually, " **You** " or collectively, " **Users** "). To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") to describe what information we gather from you, how we use that information, in what instances we may disclose it to third parties, and what we do to protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Ubokia [Terms of Service](http://ubokia.com/terms "Ubokia Terms of Service"). Your use of the Site and any personal information you provide on the Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Ubokia's [Terms of Service](http://ubokia.com/terms "Terms of Service"). By using the Site, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. 

**The Information Ubokia Collects:**

  * **User-Provided Information:** When you register for the Site, you may provide what is generally called "Personally Identifiable Information" (such as your name, email address, postal or other physical address, home/mobile telephone number). To participate in certain activities and to obtain certain services offered on the Site, you may be asked to provide additional Personally Identifiable Information. We endeavor to limit our requests for Personally Identifiable Information to information we believe is reasonably necessary to achieve our purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you will not be able to register as a User and might not be able to take advantage of many of the Site's features.
  * **"Automatically Collected" Information:** We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, web browser or device type, cookie information (as described below) and the page you request.
  * **Cookies:** Some of the pages on the Site may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that may be sent to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This allows our server to "recognize" you when your computer visits the Site in the future. Most Web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. In some instances, Ubokia may collect non-Personally Identifiable Information (aggregate or demographic data) through cookies.
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Ubokia Site. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Site, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



**The Way Ubokia Uses Information:**

  * Ubokia uses the information you provide or that we collect to develop, operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site now and in the future. We will use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, for customer service purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues, or regarding User Postings that you have posted to the Site.
  * Ubokia uses the information that you provide or that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Site works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
  * Ubokia may use "automatically collected" information and "cookies" information to: (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Site; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Site and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
  * Ubokia may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send i) messages about the Site, such as when you receive a message, comment, communication or request from another user, ii) promotional messages related to the Site and the activities of third parties we work with, and iii) messages on behalf of other users who think you may be interested in the Site or certain content available on the Site. Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your account preferences through the Site.
  * Ubokia may use non-Personally Identifiable Information such as demographic data to analyze and develop our marketing strategy and further improve the Site and our products and services.



**When Ubokia Discloses Information:**  
Your privacy is important to us, and we are not in the business of selling your information. We do, however, disclose your personally identifiable information in a variety of circumstances in connection with developing and maintaining the Site and operating our business. For example:

  * Ubokia works with third party service providers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to provide website development, hosting, maintenance, transcription, and support as well as other business services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their work; these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. These disclosures are generally made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information the purpose for which it was provided.
  * Ubokia enables users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area on the Site, such as in a listing, comment, posting or other User Postings that you upload and share, will be available to other users who access that content.
  * Ubokia may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties, to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Site.
  * Ubokia may also disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or useful to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity.
  * In the event that Ubokia is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
