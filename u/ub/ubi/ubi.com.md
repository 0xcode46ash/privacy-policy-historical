This Privacy Statement and the certification seal shown on this page confirm that Ubisoft is a member in good standing of [ESRB’s Privacy Online Program](http://www.esrb.org/privacy.asp) . ESRB’s Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website’s information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.

This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected via the playing of Ubisoft's games and demos, and on the websites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to any other information collected by Ubisoft through any other means. 

This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the websites listed above and via the playing of Ubisoft's games and demos, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Ubisoft offline.

Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

**Q2** | **What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?**  
**A2** | 

We collect several types of personal information about our guests. Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you. 

Information You Provide to Us 

All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests. We collect personal information from our guests to: 

  * Create a Ubi.com account 
  * Apply for a beta tester position 
  * Subscribe to one of our newsletters 
  * Email-a-friend 
  * Participate in our community forums or chat rooms 
  * Shop at one of our online stores 
  * Receive customer or technical support 
  * Participate in contests, events, or promotions 
  * Register product online for warranty protection 
  * Polls, surveys, or questionnaires 

Typically, this information includes: 
  * name 
  * email address 
  * telephone number 
  * shipping and billing address, and 
  * for those purchasing products online, credit card information. 

Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, country and zip code of residence, recent game purchases, and game ownership and preferences. This demographic information may be associated with your personal information. 

**Information Collected Through Technology**

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.  


Ubisoft may collect information regarding the user’s behaviour, and his/her use of Ubisoft’s demos and games to better adapt our products and services to users.

**Cookies**

Our websites also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly. 

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website. 

back to top  
  
**Q3** | **How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?**  
**A3** | 

We don’t sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent. We don’t require personal information to access our website. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our website. 

Information collected from those who create a ubi.com account is used to provide services like subscription to our general newsletter, email announcements relating to your account, free online gameplaying, access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions, and participation in community forums and contests and sweepstakes. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to a game-specific newsletter and vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, we will use your information to provide you those services. 

Should you decide to link your Ubisoft Account to your console manufacturer gaming account Ubisoft will only exchange information regarding your age, country, date of birth and email with such parties.  No other personal information such as your credit card information or address will be exchanged with such parties.

**Ubisoft Updates**

We may also use your email address to send you service announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in pricing, changes to our online service or customer support policies, and other related service changes. Also, please note that if you create a ubi.com and your account is later cancelled (e.g., due to lack of activity), we may subsequently contact you to let you know that we've reactivated your account for a short period of time. 

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

**Operational Uses**

We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. 

**Aggregate Information**

Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information. 

**Business Information**

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

**Purchase or Sale of Businesses**

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. 

**Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others**

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.

**Q4** | **What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?**  
**A4** | 

As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us. If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by visiting our profile section or contacting us at [privacy@ubisoft.com](mailto:privacy@ubisoft.com). If you contact us by email, please include the name of the website you used to register and the email address you used to register with us so we can verify your request.

**UBISOFT’S KIDS PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated August 28, 2006

Welcome to Ubisoft!

**OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT**

Ubisoft has developed its websites with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all users.  This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies concerning children under the age of 13.

Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit sites on which we post this Kids Privacy Policy.  We explain those additional protections in this Kids Privacy Policy.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from kids under 13 years of age.  COPPA also requires us to obtain the consent of parents and guardians for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites.  Below we explain how we do that for kids.  Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.

This certification seal shown on this page confirms that Ubisoft is a member in good standing of [ESRB’s Privacy Online Program](http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp).  ESRB’s Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website’s information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices.  As part of this privacy program, ESRB independently audits our websites, and administers other enforcement and accountability mechanisms. ** _

**A1**

| 

Kids can surf Ubisoft’s sites, view content, and enjoy many features without having to disclose any personal information.  We don’t collect personal information from kids while they use our sites unless they register on Ubisoft’s sites. 

For those who choose to register and participate in certain areas of our website, we collect personal information directly from kids to:

1\. Create a Ubi.com account   
2\. Subscribe to our newsletters   
3\. Shop at one of our online stores   
4\. Receive customer or technical support   
5\. Participate in contests, events, or promotions   
6\. Register product online for warranty protection   
7\. Polls, surveys, or questionnaires 

We may collect personal information from parents to allow kids to participate in certain activities offered on our websites and within our kids' subscription products.  These activities may include purchasing product in one of our online stores, participating in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or other promotions.

Typically, this information includes:

1\. name   
2\. email address   
3\. shipping and billing address, and   
4\. for those purchasing products online, credit card information. 

We may collect demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, and game preferences) and combine it with the child’s personal information.  Ubisoft will only collect this information if it is voluntarily and properly submitted to us by either the child or parent.

Note that all commercial sites directed to children under 13 are prohibited by U.S. law from conditioning a kid’s participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.

Some areas of our website may offer features like electronic postcards that allow kids to submit personal information (e.g., email address) without first disclosing their age or obtaining verifiable parental consent.  These areas provide services in a way that doesn’t require prior verifiable parental consent.

Finally, we may collect demographic information about kids.  For example, if a kid participates in a survey, we may collect those responses.  Among them, we may collect age, gender, hobbies, and interests or other demographic information about gaming and preferences.  We also use some passive technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our websites.  This demographic information may be associated with a child’s personal information.

**How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we collect from kids?**  
  
---|---  
  
**A2**

| 

We may use your child’s information to allow your child to send questions or request customer support.  We may also use your child’s information to participate in polls, surveys or questionnaires.  We may also use that information to send your child email and messages with promotional information about new products and features, special offers, and other interesting events concerning new products, events and other information about Ubisoft.

If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology" section of A2 of our General Privacy Policy) to that personal information.

We may use the information that we collect from and about kids for our business purposes, including record-keeping, transaction fulfillment, and marketing.  The contact information gathered from a kid is used to obtain consent to our information collection from their parents.

After registration, contact information may also be used to notify users of promotional activities such as contests, sweepstakes, newsletters or new products, or functional changes to our website or privacy policy.  Finally, we may use personal and demographic information for our internal marketing to study ways to enhance our services.

If a kid wins a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotional event, and we haven’t already collected the parent’s consent, we notify the parent at the email address provided to us during the registration process, and request that the parent provide his or her postal address for purposes of delivering the prize.  We may publish a winner’s first name, city, and state of residence on our web site. 

Ubisoft may share kids’ personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical support).  These entities have agreed to maintain confidentiality, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

We do not share any information about a child with any third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

  * comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; 
  * enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game/promotion rules; 
  * in connection  with the purchase or sale of assets, a merger, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar corporate transaction; or 
  * protect the safety and security of our Guests and our Web sites.

**How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?**  
  
---|---  
  
**A3**

When a child under 13 attempts to register at our website, the child can download and print a parental consent form.  Then, you, as the parent, can fill out and sign the parental consent form and mail or fax it back to us.  If the parent ignores or refuses to register the child, we will delete all contact information from our database.  If the parent permits the registration, the child will be granted access to the features described in the notification message.
