# Ubuntu One : Privacy Policy

Ubuntu One is provided by Canonical Group Ltd. At Canonical, we consider your privacy to be extremely important. These are the fundamental principles that we follow:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to provide you with services, comply with the law, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.
  * We will use personal data that you send to Ubuntu One in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



Like most website operators, Canonical collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor's request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ubuntu One's visitors use the website.

When you register for Ubuntu One, we ask for information such as your email address, billing address, and credit card information. Credit card information is only used in processing your transaction and is not stored. Members who sign up for the free account are not required to enter a credit card. We also store information such as full name, email address, and password.

We use persistent cookies to support a smooth user experience. This cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to one.ubuntu.com. We also use cookies to better understand how you interact with one.ubuntu.com and to improve one.ubuntu.com and the services overall. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computers, you should set your browsers to refuse cookies before using one.ubuntu.com. Be aware that your experience with using one.ubuntu.com will be severely degraded as most features of one.ubuntu.com will not function properly.

When you use Launchpad to log into Ubuntu One, Launchpad will send information to one.ubuntu.com such as full name, email address and your preferred time zone in order to deliver you a better experience.

We may use non-personally-identifiable information and your personal information in the following ways:

  1. To study how anonymous users interact with the Ubuntu One services and improve the overall Ubuntu One service offering.
  2. To provision services, process payment, authenticate access, and create a personalised customer experience at one.ubuntu.com.
  3. To occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ubuntu One. We mainly use our various community websites (Launchpad Answers, Ubuntu Forums, blogs, etc.) to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or modify your communications preferences in your account.
  4. To contact you to respond to enquiries.
  5. To comply with legal and regulatory requirements (including responding to subpoenas and to prevent crime). These special circumstances may require us to disclose personally identifiable information.
  6. When your actions violate the Terms of Service. 



The information you provide to us will be held on computers and may be accessed by or given to our staff working inside and outside of the UK and to third parties, including companies within Canonical’s group, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise agreed with you. You acknowledge that it may be necessary for your information to be processed by such parties and that it may be transferred to someone who provides a service to us in other countries, including some outside of the European Economic Area, and you consent to such processing and transfer. If it is necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area we will make every effort to ensure that the person to whom we pass the information agrees to treat it with the same level of protection as we do.

If we are sold or merge with another business entity your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

Unless required by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any information you provide to us without your consent.

Canonical is very concerned about protecting the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We have security measures, including administrative, physical and electronic measures, to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you in the use of the Ubuntu One service. These measures include SSL data encryption to transmit your data securely to Ubuntu One as well as technical architectures and systems to prevent unauthorised internal employees, contractors and affiliated organizations from accessing your data.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Canonical may change its Ubuntu One Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Canonical's sole discretion. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email according to your account communication preferences. What makes up a "material change" will be determined by Canonical, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgement. We encourage Ubuntu One members to frequently check this page for any changes to this policy.

You have a right to access the personal information we hold about you or to obtain a copy of it, if you would like to do so please contact us via the [account assistance form](https://web.archive.org/help/contact/) or by postal mail to the address below.

Please submit any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or about our use of your personally identifiable information to our [account assistance form](https://web.archive.org/help/contact/) or by postal mail at the following address: Canonical Group Ltd, 27th Floor Millbank Tower, 21-24 Millbank, London, England, SW1Q 4QP.
