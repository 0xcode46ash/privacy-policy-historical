Uber Privacy Policy (Last update on January 18, 2008)

  * About Uber and this Privacy Policy 

Uber, Inc. (the "Uber") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Uber's websites at www.uber.com (uber.com), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy covers Uber's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Uber gathers when you are accessing uber.com and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Uber does not own or control, or to individuals that Uber does not employ or manage.

  * Information We Collect 

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be linked to other users through a network. In connection with uber.com, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of uber.com, which allows users to identify each other and expand their personal networks. We collect the following types of information from our users:

  * Profile Information You Submit to Uber 

Uber is a, among other things, an online social networking community that connects people through networks of friends for communicating, sharing and making new friends. To accomplish this, each Uber user creates his or her own profile that contains the personal information that the user chooses to include, which we receive and store. This personal information includes such things as your:

    1. \- name 
    2. \- email address
    3. \- gender
    4. \- age 
    5. \- personal interests 
    6. \- occupation
    7. \- college
    8. \- hometown 
    9. \- photos, videos or other User Submissions (as that term is defined in the uber.com Terms of Service), to the extent that they include personal information

You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. 

  * Other Information You Submit to Uber 

Uber also collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users, send notifications related to the use of the Uber service and conduct market research and marketing for Uber's internal use only. You should also be aware that users may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the Uber website, e.g., while posting information on Uber blogs. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other users or visitors to the Uber website.

  * Other Information 

We also collect some information from users, as well as from other visitors to the Uber website that is not personally identifiable whenever they interact with uber.com or obtain services from us, such as browser type, cookie information, the pages you request, and your IP address. For example, we often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from us if your computer supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit uber.com anonymously. While Uber will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

  * How We Use Your Information 
  

  * Sharing User Profile Information 

Your personal information will be shown to those people whom you choose through the "Settings" feature on Your Page. Please note that, regardless of what personal information a user chooses to include in his or her profile, or what level of sharing he or she chooses, certain information about each user will be included in that user's public "Your Page," as indicated in their "Dashboard Preferences." Your Page will be available to any user of uber.com, whether or not the user has registered. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to message boards, classifieds, blogs, or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public and can be used by the public to send you unsolicited communications.

  * Display of Users' Information 

Except where a user might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a user's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:

    1. \- when the user invites a friend via email to become a Uber user 
    2. \- when the user sends a request to another user to add the other user to his or her friend list
    3. \- you facilitate searching user pages
    4. \- when we send notifications to the user relating to his or her use of the Uber service or uber.com 
    5. \- if the user so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Uber service or uber.com 

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a user's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Users and their friends, and other users within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a user has chosen) communicate on uber.com with each other through the Uber service, without disclosing email addresses.

  * Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks 

Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your account. However, Uber may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth above, Uber may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for Uber's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market Uber to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). Uber may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Uber and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by Uber other than as expressly instructed by Uber and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  * Agents 

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently, Uber's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

  * Business Transfers 

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Uber, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Uber goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Uber may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

  * Protection of Uber and Others 

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Uber, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
