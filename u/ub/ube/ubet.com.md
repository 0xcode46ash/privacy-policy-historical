**Our Web Site and Your Privacy**  
Like many other businesses with an online presence, WagerWorks collects personal information relating to individuals through its web site. We recognise that you may have reservations about disclosing this information online. For this reason, WagerWorks has adopted this Privacy Policy to tell you what information we collect, why we collect it and the purpose to which that information is put. 

The fundamental principle we adopt is that any information volunteered through the WagerWorks web site should be retained and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act). 

WagerWorks is registered under the Act for all purposes relating to our business and how we transact that business. We ensure that at all times we retain and process your personal data in accordance with the Act. In particular, we recognise your right to ask us to tell you what information we hold about you. 

You can find out more about the Act and your rights by visiting the Information Commissioner's web site at http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk 

**How We Collect Personal Details From You**  
We are not able to identify who you are just because you visit one of our web sites. The domain name from which you access the internet, the date and time you access the WagerWorks web site and the internet address of the web site from which you may have linked to a WagerWorks site will not allow us to identify who you are. 

In certain parts of our web site, you have the option to provide us with your personal details. This is how we collect your personal details. We do not use cookies or other hidden software to collect user information from our web site. 

**Why We Collect These Details**  
We ask you to provide your personal details to us either to enable us to send you information about our products and services or to respond to a specific enquiry you may have. For example, if you send us an email requesting information about WagerWorks we will use your email address and other relevant information you supply to respond to your enquiry. 

By providing your personal details to us, you are expressly consenting under all relevant Data Protection legislation: to the use of your information in the manner set out above and to allow us to further develop this website, our business and our services to you; to the transport, if necessary, of your information worldwide; and to the disclosure, as necessary, of your information to a third party involved in the design, operation or maintenance of this website. 

**Security and Access**  
The information you provide to us is kept confidential to WagerWorks. This means that all our employees and other data processors who may have access to and who are associated with the processing of your details are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personal data supplied by you. 

We do not disclose or sell your personal details to any third party, unless we are required to do so by law or as described above. However, in the event that the whole business or any of its assets are acquired, the information provided by you may be one of the transferred assets. 

We have implemented security measures to ensure that the information supplied by you via our web site is safeguarded from:   
· unauthorised access;   
· improper use or disclosure;   
· unauthorised modification;   
· unlawful destruction or accidental loss.

We will comply with all the requirements of the Act and other legislation in relation to disclosure of this information. 

In particular, you should be aware that in order to provide you with a copy of the personal data we keep about you, we will require proof of your identity. We also reserve the right to make a small charge based on the charges then currently prescribed by the relevant legislation.
