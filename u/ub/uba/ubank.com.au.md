## Keeping your private information private

The privacy of your personal information has always been important to us at the National Australia Bank Group (" **Group** "). The Group is the National Australia Bank Limited and its related bodies corporate such as MLC Ltd. It includes all our banking, financing, funds management, financial planning, superannuation, insurance, broking and e-commerce organisations.

UBank is a division of the National Australia Bank Limited, and we are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) and any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation, as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff are trained to respect your privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures.

## What our Privacy Policy covers

This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us – both online and on the phone. However, depending on the Group organisation with which you deal, further privacy information may apply in addition to the matters discussed in this Privacy Policy (see, for example, "Our Websites" below).
