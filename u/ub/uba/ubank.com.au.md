**How we collect and hold your information**

We understand that your personal information needs to be looked after and isn’t something you leave lying around for just anybody to take. So unless it’s unreasonable or impracticable, we will try to collect personal information directly from you (referred to as **‘solicited information’** ). For this reason, it's important that you help us to do this and keep your contact details up-to-date.

There are many ways we seek information from you. We might collect your information when you fill out a form with us, when you’ve given us a call, used our websites or dropped into one of our branches. We also find using electronic means, such as email or SMS, a convenient way to communicate with you and to verify your details.

**How we collect your information from other sources**

Sometimes we collect information about you from other sources. We do this only if it’s necessary to do so. Instances of when we may need to include where:

  * we can’t get hold of you and we rely on publicly available information to update your contact details;
  * we need information from an insurer about an insurance application you make through us;
  * we are checking the security you are offering through public registers and our service providers; and
  * at your request, we exchange information with your legal or financial advisers or other representatives.



**What if you don't want to provide us with your personal information?**

If you don’t provide your personal information to us, we may not be able to:

  * provide you with the product or service you want;
  * manage or administer your product or service;
  * verify your identity or protect against fraud; or
  * let you know about other products or services from across the Group that might better meet your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs.



**How we collect and hold your credit information**

We will collect your credit information from details included in your application for credit (whether paper based, phone or electronic). In addition to what we say above about collecting information from other sources, other main sources for collecting credit information are:

  * other credit providers;
  * your co-loan applicants or co-borrowers;
  * your guarantors/proposed guarantors;
  * your employer, accountant, real estate agent or other referees;
  * your agents and other representatives like your referrers, brokers, solicitors, conveyancers and settlement agents;
  * organisations that help us to process credit applications such as mortgage managers;
  * organisations that check the security you are offering such as valuers;
  * organisations involved in the securitisation of our loans such as loan servicers, trust managers, trustees and security trustees;
  * organisations providing lenders mortgage insurance and title insurance to us or our related lenders;
  * bodies that issue identification documents to help us check your identity; and
  * our service providers involved in helping us to provide credit or to administer credit products, including our debt collectors and our legal advisers.



**What do we do when we get information we didn’t ask for?**

Because we are a big organisation, people often share information with us we haven’t sought out (referred to as **‘unsolicited information’** ). Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we will check whether that information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities. If it is, we’ll handle this information the same way we do with other information we seek from you. If not, we’ll ensure we do the right thing and destroy or de-identify it.

**When will we notify you that we have received your information?**

When we receive personal information from you directly, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you how and why we collected your information, who we may disclose it to and outline how you can access it, seek correction of it or make a complaint.

Sometimes we collect your personal information from third parties. You may not be aware that we have done so. If we collect information that can be used to identify you, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of that collection.

**How do we take care of your personal information?**

We store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:

  * confidentiality requirements of our employees;
  * document storage security policies;
  * security measures for access to our systems;
  * only giving access to personal information to a person who is verified to be able to receive that information;
  * control of access to our buildings; and
  * electronic security systems, such as firewalls and data encryption on our websites.



For more information on our online security and how you can protect yourself online see <http://www.nab.com.au/personal/banking/nab-internet-banking/security>.

We can store personal information physically or electronically with third party data storage providers. Where we do this, we use contractual arrangements to ensure those providers take appropriate measures to protect that information and restrict the uses to which they can put that information.

**What happens when we no longer need your information?**

We’ll only keep your information for as long as we require it for our purposes. We’re also required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law, such as the Corporations Act, the Anti-Money Laundering & Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, and the Financial Transaction Reports Act for example. When we no longer require your information, we’ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.
