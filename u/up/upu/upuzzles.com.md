## Who does Universal Uclick share information with?

We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties (aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information) unless you have "opted-in" to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Statement. As stated, Universal Uclick may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products.

However, Universal Uclick may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on Universal Uclick; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Universal Uclick; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.

We may gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.

In the event that Universal Uclick is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

## What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?

## What else should I know about my privacy?

Universal Uclick's Commitment to Data Security Protecting user privacy and Personal Information is a high priority for Universal Uclick.

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of your Personal Information. Universal Uclick maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your Personal Information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of information between your PC and our computers. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take great care to protect your Personal Information, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

We also take precautions to protect your Personal Information off-line. Access to all user information is restricted. Only our employees, agents and processors whose jobs require accessing users' Personal Information are granted database access or administrator-level accounts on servers that contain such Personal Information. Finally, all servers containing users' Personal Information are kept locked in a secure data center and require a secure login to access them remotely.

Remember to sign off our Site and close your browser window when you are finished using it. This is to ensure that others cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a terminal that is accessible to others, such as the library, at school, at the workplace or at an Internet café.

### Security.

Universal Uclick has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. We use thawte SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Thawte has checked and verified the company registration documents and the site's registered domain name. Consumer Guidelines: How to know whether a site is secure

### Chat Rooms and Other Public Areas.

Universal Uclick may offer chat, bulletin board, or other public functions and any posting by you is considered public information available to other users. Any posting is governed by Universal Uclick Terms of Service.

### Refer a Friend.

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Universal Uclick will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit an uclick Site. Universal Uclick stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact uclick to request the removal of this information from their database.

Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take appropriate measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you use a computer in a public place or share a computer with others, remember to sign out and close your browser window when you finish a session with Universal Uclick in order to prevent others from accessing your personal information.
