No personally identifiable information should be submitted to or posted at The Upper Room by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 
> 
> This web site does not solicit or allow children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. In the event that we ask for information from children under the age of 13, we do not include personally identifiable information such as child's last name, city, or e-mail address. 
> 
> If our Upper Room staff receive e-mail from children under 13, we may contact the child under the following circumstances:  
> 
> 
> **a)** to respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child where it is not used to re-contact the child for other purposes, 
> 
> **b)** in order to request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification, and 
> 
> **c)** to respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child and not used to re-contact the child beyond the scope of that request (such as the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription). Where the information is used to contact the child more than once, The Upper Room uses reasonable efforts to provide parental notification.
