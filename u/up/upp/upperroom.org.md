**LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS POLICY; REVISIONS**

We provide use of this website ("this Site") subject to our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms/). By accessing, browsing or otherwise using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood, and are agreeing to be bound by the Terms and Conditions of Use and this Privacy Policy. 

IF YOU CANNOT OR DO NOT WISH TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE OR THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS, BROWSE OR USE THIS SITE AND YOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE THESE ACTIVITIES IMMEDIATELY. 

We may change, revise or supplement this Privacy Policy all at any time, in our sole discretion, for any or no reason, and without notice. Your continued use of this Site signifies your acceptance of any such changes, revisions or supplements. For this reason, please visit this page on a regular basis to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version of this document. 

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time on-line with their children and to participate in the activities offered on this Site. 

This Site is not for children under 13 years of age. However, there are some areas of this Site that may be attractive to children under 13. We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or service available on or through this Site on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonable necessary to participate in an activity. We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of this Site who are under 13 years of age. No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, this Site by visitors under 13 years of age without the prior written consent of their parent or guardian. 

If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child's parent or guardian: 

  * Respond to a one-time request from the child;
  * Provide notice of the child's communication to the child's parent or guardian; 
  * Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on this Site; or
  * Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child's parent or guardian and the opportunity to discontinue any future delivery of the above information.



Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it. Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child. Such requests can be made by contacting us at [info@upperroom.org](mailto:info@upperroom.org). We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child's personally identifiable information to such person. 

We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW IT IS USED**

By accessing or using this Site, you may provide us with two types of information: personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of computer technology. 

We may ask for certain personally-identifiable information for the purposes of providing services that you request. For example, we may ask you for this information when you place an order, participate in an activity, or contact us. 

We may exchange, sell or rent your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address or telephone number) with companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. We may also use your personally-identifiable information (including your telephone number) for our own marketing purposes, or for the purposes of promotions research or analysis. We may also use it to provide third parties with aggregate, anonymous statistical information about use of this Site. Further, we may disclose your personally-identifiable information to our agents or contractors for the purpose of their performing services for us (including such services as billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing, and promotions or marketing management). These service providers are restricted from using this information in any way other than to provide services for us, and they may not share or resell this information. 

We comply fully with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, and we do not send unsolicited e-mail. However, we reserve the right to contact you by e-mail with respect to your order of our products or services or your account. If you have registered for on-line discussions, e-mail newsletters, Email Edition of The Upper Room daily devotional magazine, or other services, you may also receive e-mail specific to your participation in these activities. 

You may update and edit your contact preferences, or "opt out" of receiving any further e-mails from us, by sending an e-mail to us at [marketing@upperroom.org](mailto:marketing@upperroom.org), by calling us at 1 (615) 340-7221 or toll-free 1 (877) 899-2780, by writing to us at the above address, or by following the "opt out" instructions in our e-mail to you. Please provide us with your exact name and address in your correspondence. 

We use "cookies" to collect non-personally-identifiable information, on an aggregate basis, about how this Site is used. This information may include the date and time of visits to this Site and time spent on this Site. The use of "cookies" allows us to personalize your use of this Site and to provide greater convenience each time that you visit it. You may choose to disable "cookies" on your computer, block all "cookies", or receive a warning before a "cookie" is stored on your computer (please consult instructions for your web browser). However, if you disable or block "cookies", it is possible that some parts of this Site will not be accessible to you. 

**Security**

We endeavor to offer the most advanced security measures with respect to your personally-identifiable information. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You can help protect your personal information by using a combination of letters and numbers in your password, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off when you are finished with the use of this Site on a shared computer. 

**PRIVACY ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES**

Other websites may be accessible through this Site; the operators of these websites may collect personally-identifiable information about you. Their privacy practices are not covered by this Policy, and we are not responsible for these practices. Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk.
