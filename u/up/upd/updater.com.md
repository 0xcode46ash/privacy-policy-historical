# Updater | Privacy

###### Introduction

Updater's mission is to put you in control. We want to help you organize and complete your moving-related tasks and make the decisions that are best for you. Earning your trust is our top priority. So it should go without saying that Updater is 100% committed to your privacy. But we'd like to explain our privacy policy here because we’re proud of it and we want you to know exactly what information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we protect it.

###### Our pledge

We never sell, rent or share your personal information behind your back. We would only make an exception to this pledge if we were required to do so by law.

###### Information we share

We do not share your personal information (such as your name, old or new address, move date, etc.) with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Updater unless one of the following circumstances apply:

 **To implement our services**

In order to implement any of the services (each a “Service” and collectively our "Services") that we offer at https://www.updater.com or technology "powered by Updater" available on third party websites (Collectively, the "Site"), we may need to share your personal information with third parties. In such situations, we may share only such personal information as is necessary to to complete the ordered Service that requires sharing of your information to implement said Service. For example, if you request a free consultation with ADT Home Security, we will share your applicable information with our ADT marketing partner so that they may contact you; or if you instruct us to send a change of address notification to a certain organization, we share your applicable information with the selected organization so that they may process your requested address change.

 **With your explicit consent**

We may share your personal information that you provide on the Site to certain third parties if you instruct us to share your information, or you consent to the sharing of your personal information by opting-in to hear about certain deals in your neighborhood or other marketing initiatives.

 **To share with friends**

We'll share your name, old and new address via email to your personal contacts that you specify. Also, we'll create for you a customized moving page that includes your old and new address ("Private Moving Page"). The Private Moving Page will be shared with the contacts that you specify. We'll also create a customized moving page that only includes the city and state of your new and old address ("Public Moving Page"). The Public Moving Page is the page that will be posted to social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, if you elect to utilize our social sharing functionality. If someone comments on your Private Moving Page, the link that appears on social network websites will be to your Public Moving Page.

 **For external processing**

We may provide your personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process certain services, such as filing USPS Change of Address Forms. In all such situations, the provision of information is necessary for processing a Service that you order and appropriate confidentiality and security measures are in place to protect your information.

 **For legal reasons**

We'll share your personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Updater if we believe doing so is necessary to:

  * Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
  * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.



 **For aggregate or reflective data**

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners (“Aggregate Data”). For example, we may share information publicly to show moving trends and other information about new movers. Data of all Users (as defined below) may be included.

We may use old and new address data of a User (as defined below) to indicate the general or approximate location of a recent move on Updater (“Reflective Data”). In such situations, old and new address data are randomly obscured in order to not display the User's actual old or new address. Thus, the data shown publicly is merely reflective of the area of the recent move.

Any User who does not want Updater to use his or her personal information in either Aggregate Data or Reflective Data sets, whether such data sets are shared publicly or not, may email [privacy@updater.com](mailto:privacy@updater.com) to opt-out any time.

 **With the website operator hosting Updater technology**

Updater technology is made available on third party websites. In all such situations, the Services offered are clearly marked "powered by Updater". When Updater technology is powering websites other than https://www.updater.com, we may need to share your personal information with the applicable third party that owns and operates the website. In such situations, we may share your personal information only with the applicable third party business that owns and operates the hosting website, and such business will protect your personal information pursuant to their privacy policy. For example, if an Updater User creates their account on https://www.changeofaddressform.com or https://www.whitefence.com using technology powered by Updater, Updater will share certain personal information of such User with WhiteFence pursuant to their privacy policy.

###### Information we collect

We collect certain information from all visitors to our site, regardless of whether they sign up for an Updater user account or order one of our Services. Beyond this baseline level of collected information, we collect and store additional information from visitors who sign up for an Updater user account ("Users").

###### Information we collect from all visitors

We collect from all visitors certain information about the type of computer, operating system, and Internet browser that the visitor is using to access our site as well as the visitors’ IP address (or that of their Internet service provider). We also place a cookie in visitors’ browsers during their visit to the site in order to maintain their session during that visit, but this cookie disappears when the session ends or the browser is closed. We also store your engagement behavior, such as buttons or links you click on the Site or information you type or enter into forms on the Site.

###### Information we collect from users

The information that we collect from Users includes, at minimum, their email address and their password. In addition, if a User fills out any of the forms on the Site while they're signed in to their account (or if a visitor to the site fills out any such forms and during that same session becomes a User), then we'll link the information contained in such forms to the User's account in our database. This information may include the User's first and last name, their new and old home addresses, their home phone number, their mobile phone number, whether the User wants Updater to file, on behalf of the User, a change of address form with the United States Postal Service, whether the User is acting on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a household, when the change of address order should become effective, and for how long it should remain in force, any businesses, educational institutions, or other organizations (each, a "Business") the User has selected to receive a change of address notification from Updater, etc. If a User orders a service that requires payment or identity verification, then we may require the User to input additional information. For example, this information may include a credit card number and credit card expiration date or, if the User selects to use a PayPal account, then we'll collect the PayPal ID of such User. Please note that we will not store any of this information other than (i) the expiration date and the last four digits of the User’s credit card number and (ii) the User's PayPal ID.

###### Security

Updater is committed to protecting the information of our Users, which is why we have chosen to protect all User information using Amazon’s Web Services cloud-based computing and data storage infrastructure.
