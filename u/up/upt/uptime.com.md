Info Products Sites, the provider of Maintenance Resources (the "Services"), has created this Privacy Policy to explain our information-gathering and dissemination practices. Your use of our Services confirms your acknowledgement and acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### I. What information we do and do not collect

### \- Personally Identifiable Information

We only obtain and retain personally identifiable information that you give to us and certain related transactional information which we collect based on your use of our Services. For example, you might supply your name and email address by contacting us or placing an order on line or by telephone 

### \- Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit our Services, we do not collect data about who you are or any other personally identifiable information except as described above. We do, however, collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you based upon your activity on our website. We may collect machine data such as processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, and video cards. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

### \- Cookies

Cookies are small data files that are sent from our servers to your computer during a browsing session. In order to make our Service more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may use cookies to assign your Internet browser a unique random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that is stored in a file on your computer. By using a cookie, we are able to automatically identify your browser and track your use of our Service and our web pages. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the acceptance of cookies if you prefer. You can also delete cookie files from your computer after they have been stored.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For example, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads to our Service, and those ads place cookies on your computer. However, those cookies do not reveal any of your personally identifiable information. Google provides information about their advertising and privacy, including how to opt out of the use of their [DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) at the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

### \- Children's Information

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and fair information practices, we do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from children.

### II. How do we use the information we collect?

### \- Personally Identifiable Information

We may use your email address to contact you regarding account issues and as a way of letting you know about new features of our Service.

We do not sell, rent, loan, or otherwise share personally identifiable information, including email lists, with third parties.

We may be required by law, court order, governmental agency, or law enforcement authority to disclose whatever personally identifiable information we may have collected from you. We may also disclose your information to law enforcement authorities investigating suspected illegal activity.

We do not combine personally identifiable information with any of the non-personally identifiable information gathered through the use of cookies.

### \- Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We compile and analyze non-personally identifiable information on an aggregated basis. For example, we may know that ninety people visited this Privacy Policy yesterday or how long the average visitor spent using our Services last month. But we do not link this information with any of the personally identifiable information that we collect from you.

We may also use this non-personally identifiable information to conduct internal research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our visitors.

We also pass the aggregated data (but not your personally identifiable information) to advertising agencies and firms that conduct site analysis, such as Google Analytics, in order to help such companies feed advertising to our Services in the most efficient manner.

We do not restrict the recipients of any non-personally identifiable information from using that information.

We do not monitor third party use of the information we share with them. However, none of that information can be used by third parties to identify you.

### III. How long do we retain the information we collect from you?

We retain your Maintenance Resources account information and the aggregated non-personally identifiable information we collect from you indefinitely. 

### IV. Can you request that we purge from our system the information we collect from you?

We do not currently have any procedure by which users can request that we purge the information we collect from them. However, the only personally identifiable information we collect is the Maintenance Resources account information. You may change (or delete) your Maintenance Resources account information at any time, although in doing so it does not necessarily mean that the original account information will be deleted from our servers.

### V. What measures do we take to protect the security of the information you submit?

Our website, and all of the data related to the Services, reside on servers maintained by a commercial hosting company. That company takes certain precautions to protect the servers from intrusion, including securing the facilities in which the servers are located and maintaining a firewall to protect against unauthorized access. None of these measures is foolproof; and we do not monitor the web hosting company's facilities or procedures to determine its compliance with the security procedures it says it employs.

### VI. How will you know of changes to this Privacy Policy?

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy to comply with applicable laws, to improve your experience, or to reflect any general change in our policy. Any changes we make to this Privacy Policy will be posted to this web page. We will not send you messages informing you of these changes, so you are responsible for checking this web page frequently. You are encouraged to print or download a copy of this document for your permanent records.

### VII. How can you contact us if you have any questions?

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or our practices or procedures with regard to personally identifiable information, you should contact us at [Contact Us](mailto:mr@maintenanceresources.com) or by postal mail at: 1983 North Hunt Street, Terre Haute, IN 47805, USA, or by telephone at 812.877.7119 ** **.

Effective date of this Privacy Policy: December 17, 2009
