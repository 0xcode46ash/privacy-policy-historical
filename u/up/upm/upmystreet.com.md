### Privacy policy

##### Your privacy is important to us

UpMyStreet believes your right to privacy is important. To run an efficient, effective service, however, we need to collect and use certain information about our users. 

##### What information do we collect and why?

When you sign up to place an ad on our classified ads service, you will need to submit certain personal details: your name, e-mail, address and phone number. This will allow us and our partner websites (asserta home, Exchange & Mart, Job Channel and Ad Trader) to contact you if there are any problems. It will also enable you to amend, delete or renew your ad without having to re-submit all the details. We will not sell or pass on any personal information about you to a third party except our partner websites without your permission. If you would like to delete or amend your personal details at any time, please e-mail us by clicking on 'Feedback' on the website or call 0906 364 6300, quoting your user name and password. 

UpMyStreet may also gather anonymous information for its own use and/or to be shared with third parties. This is information that does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes, for improving the services we offer, or for informing advertisers of the number of consumers that have clicked on their advertising banners. Generally, this information involves 'traffic' data, such as the number of first-time and return users to the website every month. 

Occasionally, UpMyStreet sends e-mails to users about products or services that it considers may be of interest to them. Many of our users find these promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for something or taking advantage of a special offer. When you submit a classified ad, for which you are required to give your e-mail, you will be asked to indicate whether or not you would like to receive promotional material. When you fill in a feedback form online, you will be asked the same question. If at any time afterwards you would like to change this instruction, you can e-mail us by clicking on 'Feedback' on the website, or call our help line on 0906 364 6300 (calls cost 60p a minute). 

##### How do we protect your personal details?

We have strict procedures governing the storage and disclosure of personal details to prevent unauthorised access and misuse. In addition, all your personal information is password-protected: only you, UpMyStreet and our partner websites have access to your personal information. 

##### E-mail this page to a friend

If you use this service, you can be sure that UpMyStreet will not collect the e-mail addresses that you provide for other purposes. We will only hold this information for as long as is necessary to transmit the e-mail to the recipient. 

##### Do you have any other questions about privacy?

We want you to feel happy about any information you give us and know that you have control over the way it is used. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please e-mail them to us by clicking on 'Feedback' on the website.
