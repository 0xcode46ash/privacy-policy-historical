UpMyStreet.com may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation for the purpose of internal business administration and analysis.

For these purposes we may send your information internationally, including to countries outside the European Economic Association. Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK.

#### Using information on visits to improve our services

During the course of any visit to UpMyStreet.com, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded onto your computer. Most websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and so probably its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Both the cookies and the code provide non-personal statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors’ screen settings and other general information. UpMyStreet.com uses this type of information to help it improve services to its users.
