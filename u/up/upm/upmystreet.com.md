When you register you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc.).

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy.

You will also receive advice for your property, up-to-date information about your local and home services, and marketing material from UpMyStreet and our parent company uSwitch. You can unsubscribe from these email communications at any time.

#### How do we use your personal information?

UpMyStreet may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation for the purpose of internal business administration, marketing and analysis.

We will not rent, trade or sell your data to others.

If you enter a contest or another promotion, we will use the data so that we can administer the contest and notify winners.

If you have opted to receive UpMyStreet and/or uSwitch communications, we will use your personal information to send these newsletters to you.

If you have requested to be kept informed of services that we offer, we will contact you with these details.

We will respect your email privacy. We will, however, mail you occasionally with information about important changes to our service and a limited amount of marketing material which may promote some of our partners' services.

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage in order to help us develop the design and layout of the website.

For these purposes we may transfer, store and process your personal information internationally, including to/in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
