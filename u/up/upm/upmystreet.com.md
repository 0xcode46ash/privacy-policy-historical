# UpMyStreet Small print: Privacy policy

### Privacy policy

#### Your privacy is important to us

UpMyStreet believes your right to privacy is important. To run an efficient, effective service, however, we need to collect and use certain information about our users. 

#### What information do we collect and why?

In general, you can browse the UpMyStreet.com website without disclosing any information about yourself. 

Registering (Creating a My UpMyStreet profile) on our site is optional. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use the website. However, you will not be able to receive our monthly newsletter or post on the Conversations service. 

When you create a My UpMyStreet profile you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc). 

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. 

By creating a My UpMyStreet profile you will be opting in to receive:

  * The UpMyStreet monthly newsletter. You can opt-out of receiving the newsletter through the Edit your profile option or by unsubscribing through the newsletter.
  * USwitch.com's newsletter. uSwitch.com is UpMyStreet's parent company, and is the UK's leading home services and personal finance comparison and switching service. It's free to use and impartial.  
[About uSwitch](http://www.uswitch.com/Popups/about_uswitch.asp?ref=)  [uSwitch's privacy and cookie policy](http://www.uswitch.com/Popups/privacy_policy.asp?ref=)  
You can opt-out of receiving the newsletter by unsubscribing via the newsletter or by contacting [help@uswitch.com](mailto:help@uswitch.com).



#### How do we use your personal information?

UpMyStreet.com may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation for the purpose of internal business administration and analysis. 

If you enter a contest or another promotion, we will use the data so that we can administer the contest and notify winners. 

If you have opted to receive our newsletter, we will contact you with these details. 

We will respect your email privacy. You will not receive unsolicited mail from UpMyStreet.com and/or from third parties. We will, however, mail you occasionally with information about your My UpMyStreet profile or important changes to our service. 

We will not rent, trade or sell your data to others. 

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage in order to help us develop the design and layout of the website. 

For these purposes we may send your information internationally, including to countries outside the European Economic Association. Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK. 

#### How do we protect your personal details?

We have strict procedures governing the storage and disclosure of personal details to prevent unauthorised access and misuse. In addition, all your personal information is password-protected: only you and UpMyStreet have access to your personal information. 

#### Access to your personal information

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information UpMyStreet.com holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests.) Please address requests to the Data Protection Officer, UpMyStreet.com, 10th Floor, Portland House, Stag Place, London, SW1E 5BH. 

#### Email this page to a friend

If you use this service, you can be sure that UpMyStreet will not collect the email addresses that you provide for other purposes. We will only hold this information for as long as is necessary to transmit the email to the recipient.
