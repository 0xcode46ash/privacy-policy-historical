# Upstart

The types of personal information we collect depends on the products and services you use. It may include: 

  * Your contact information such as your name, address, phone, and email;

  * Information that we use to verify your identity, make decisions about your Upstart funding, or manage risk such as your date of birth, social security number, your credit history, your credit scores, and your payment history;

  * Information about your education, such as your SAT scores, your college, your major(s), and your grades including your college transcript, your employment, and your personal interests; 

  * Information so we can process your payments such as your bank account numbers;

  * Information about your income, including your tax returns, W-2, brokerage statements, and pay stubs.




In addition, when you visit our website or use our products and services we automatically collect certain information from your computer, mobile phone or other access device. This information includes your IP address, device information including identifier, name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site and the pages you accessed on our website. 

We collect this information from you in order to provide you and our other customers with the products and services offered through our website, provide notices to you about these services, provide customer support, protect against fraud, fulfill legal requirements, and to improve our services. 

If you have applied for Upstart funding, in addition to publishing the information in your profile on our website, we may share some of your personal information with backers interested in funding you. We will let you know what information is shared and with whom before you choose to publish your profile. Unless you have agreed to it, backers are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to enable our services. If you have registered to be an Upstart backer we will publish the information in your profile on our website. Any information you voluntarily include in your profile, either as a backer or as an upstart, becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. 

All financial companies need to share customersâ€™ personal information to run their everyday business. We may share your personal information with: 

  * Service providers who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services, and financial institutions that we partner with to offer a product. Our contracts dictate that these third parties only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit

  * Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.

  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. 

  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (1) we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, (2) we need to do so to comply with law, or (3) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

  * Other third parties but only if you consent or direct us to do so.




Upstart will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described above. 

Information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user is not considered personal information. Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third parties can market to you. However, because we will not share your information in these instances, there is no need for you to opt-out from the information we share. 

We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We authorize our employees to get your information only when they need it to do their work, and we require companies that work for us to protect your information. 

When you access our website or content or use our services, we (or companies we work with) may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a customer; customize our services, content and advertising; collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and help prevent fraud. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help legal section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies.
