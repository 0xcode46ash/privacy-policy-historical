You accept this Privacy Policy when you register on our website, [www.upstart.com](https://web.archive.org/). 

The types of personal information we collect depends on the products and services you use. It may include: 

  * Your contact information such as your name, address, phone, and email;

  * Information that we use to verify your identity, make decisions about your Upstart funding, or manage risk such as your date of birth, social security number, your credit history, your credit scores, and your payment history;

In addition, when you visit our website or use our products and services we automatically collect certain information from your computer, mobile phone or other access device. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access our website. When you use our website, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on our website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. When you use our website, we may also employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the website. 

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our website through a third-party connection or log-in, such as LinkedIn, or otherwise link an account to our website, that third party may pass certain information about you and your use of its service to us. This information could include the user ID associated with your account (for example, your LinkedIn UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking them to our website. You may also unlink your third party account from our website by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service. 

We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We authorize our employees to get your information only when they need it to do their work, and we require companies that work for us to protect your information. 

When you access our website or content or use our services, we (or companies we work with) may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a customer; customize our services, content and advertising; collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and help prevent fraud. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help legal section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies. 

In the event that any of your information that we control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify you and take other steps in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations. 

Upon termination or deactivation of your Upstart account, we may retain your profile information and user content and information for backup, archival, or audit purposes. 

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from our website, including any information or content they contain. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your user content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like LinkedIn) and you allow such a third-party access to your user content you do so at your own risk. 

We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as users. Our website and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
