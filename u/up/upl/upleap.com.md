# UpLeap.com - Privacy Policy

**

  UpLeap.com understands their obligation to parents and children alike and adheres to the highest standards of decency and integrity in all their operations. Similarly, we’re conscious of the need to protect visitor privacy on the Internet, especially for children, who are at greater risk than any other group.

 _Privacy and Use of Information_

  UpLeap.com collects information on a purely voluntary basis. We don’t require this information to obtain access to our site. Personal information received from visitors will only be used internally and not sold or provided to any third parties. UpLeap.com requests a minimal amount of information from the user.

  We ask that children under 13 get parental permission if they are interested in obtaining an e-mail account. If the parent approves, we ask that the parent provides the information required for the child to join.

   Once a member, you will (very rarely) receive e-mail from advertisers containing interesting ads. These ads will "Never" contain adult oriented or objectionable material. At any time the visitor can elect to "Unsubscribe" from these mailings.

 _Links_

  UpLeap.com will have "links" to other sites; we have made every effort to only link to sites which meet our high standards of quality and decency. We do our best to make sure these links are active and informative.
