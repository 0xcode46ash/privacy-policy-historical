## privacy Policy

## Updated March 3rd, 2014

The following details our privacy Policy (the “Policy’) at UPFLUENCE Inc (UFPLUENCE) and describes the types of information we gather from those persons visiting the Internet websites www.upfluence.com, www.upfluence.fr, www.upfluence.co.uk, www.upfluence.co, www.upfluence.ch, (the “Site(s)”) and how we use such information. We understand the importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner. This Policy applies to all of the services offered by UPFLUENCE (the “services”) on the Sites. By accessing the Sites, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. Each time you use the Sites, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Sites, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.

## Use of Information Collected by UPFLUENCE

UPFLUENCE may collect two types of information from users of our Sites: “personal information” (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, etc.) and “aggregate information” (such as frequency of visits to any of the Sites, search terms entered, Site pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.) We use this information in an effort to improve your experience on the Sites and to communicate with you about information that you request. We may also use this information to help us target specific services or offers to you, to help us develop and improve our Sites, and to tailor our Sites to your interests.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Information

UPFLUENCE only collects personal information that is voluntarily provided when users sign up for an UPFLUENCE site. We ask you for personal information such as your name, address, email address, and social security number. (Please note that we require social security numbers for income tax reporting purposes.) We may also request PayPal payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.

## Collecting and Using Your Aggregate Information

UPFLUENCE also collects aggregate information, which is non-personally identifiable information about you, such as frequency of visits to the Sites, search terms entered, browser type, etc. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. UPFLUENCE uses aggregate information to provide its services and remuneration, as well as to determine the use of our Sites and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics.

Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information Collected Online with Third Parties UPFLUENCE shares personal information with our parents and subsidiaries, and on occasion, we may share personal information with third party service providers, such as credit card processing companies. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services for which they have been hired to provide. In addition, in order to protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the personal information you provide when you sign up for a PayPerPost account. In the course of such verification, we may receive personal information about you. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes.

Given the nature of UPFLUENCE’s website, information willingly provided by the influencers (blog writers, social media users and any other user who registered as an influencer) will be shared with advertisers (any user registered as un advertiser on the websites) in order to ease the selection process.

In following circumstances, UPFLUENCE may elect to share or transfer your personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on UPFLUENCE, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of UPFLUENCE; (iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of UPFLUENCE or other persons, or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law.

Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online with Third Parties We may share, sell or trade with third parties aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. As stated earlier, such information does not identify you individually.

When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page.
