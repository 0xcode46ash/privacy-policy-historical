## UJAM, Inc. Privacy Policy (Effective as of August 24, 2010)

**We at UJAM, Inc. have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, process, use and share information we obtain through our web site located at www.UJAM.com (the "UJAM Site"), and any other Internet products and services we may offer (together, the "Internet Products").**

This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Internet Products. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. 

**By using the UJAM Site, you explicitly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 24, 2010**

**You can visit the UJAM Site without telling us who you are or revealing to us any information by which someone could personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Identifiable Personal Data").**

However, to obtain access to certain areas of the UJAM Site (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards and other online forums), to receive certain services we provide (e.g., e-mail newsletters), to make a purchase from the UJAM Site, to register a product with us, or to participate in contests we may offer from time to time, you may be required to provide certain Personal Data as well as information about yourself (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) by which it is impossible or substantially more difficult for a third party to personally identify you without additional information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Pseudonymized Personal Data"). 

We use Personal Data and Pseudonymized Personal Data (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Personal Data") to conclude contractual relationships with you and to fulfill your requests for products and services, to monitor and improve our UJAM Site, products, and services, and to contact you from time to time about us, the UJAM Site, and our products and services. We do not use Personal Data for any other purpose. 

**We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how you use the UJAM Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data").**

For example, each time you visit the UJAM Site we may automatically collect your IP address, browser type, browser, browser language and computer type, access time and date, the webpage from which you came, and the webpage(s) that you access during your visit as well as other web server log files. Such Usage Data is collected, in particular, for the safety and protection of the UJAM site. 

We also may use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer's hard drive) and web beacons (which are invisible files located on webpages that you visit) to keep track of your use of the UJAM Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password and preferences, to tailor the UJAM Site to meet your personal interests and needs, for our own market research purposes, to provide advertisements that we believe you may be interested in, for billing purposes, and to improve the quality of the UJAM Site. 

In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the UJAM Site may also collect information through cookies and web beacons to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies and web beacons set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. 

Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. 

**Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of the UJAM Site and accompaniment service may not function properly. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.**

Except as otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Data or Usage Data (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "User Information") with any third party without your permission. 

From time to time, we may share your Pseudonymized Personal Data including Usage Data to enable third parties who serve advertisements on the UJAM Site to deliver advertisements that will be relevant to you. 

From time to time, we may share aggregated User Information (excluding any credit card numbers you may provide to us to purchase any of our products or services) with third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you. 

If you affirmatively authorize us to do so, from time to time we may share your Personal Data with third parties so they may contact you regarding goods or services in which you may be interested. If you have authorized us to do, and later decide that you would no longer like us to disclose your Personal Data to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, please contact us as noted below in "Choice/Opt-Out." 

**Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us to, share any User Information:**

  1. in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or where disclosure is otherwise required by law; 
  2. if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; 
  3. if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding abuse of the UJAM Site infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); 
  4. to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); 
  5. with potential acquirers or others involved in such transaction if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired by or merged with another entity; or 
  6. with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., credit card processing services, shipping services, or data management and storage services or other services required for the operation of the UJAM Site); provided, however, that in those circumstances we request that our service providers not share your User Information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. 



There may be areas of the UJAM Site that (e.g., chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other online forums) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of the UJAM Site. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas. 

You may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws which may include the right for you to receive a copy of the personal data that UJAM holds about you, including information relating to the source of the data, the recipients to whom data are transferred, and the purpose of recording the data. For a copy of your personal data or other information you are entitled to request, please contact UJAM at the e-mail address set out below. We may charge you a nominal fee for complying with such a request in accordance with applicable law. In addition, you may have a right to request that personal data is corrected, blocked or deleted if the data is factually incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile. Please note that any Personal Data that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your request, and that if you delete certain information you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information. Also, please note that we will maintain Personal Data in our database whenever we are required to do so by law. 

When you sign up to be on a mailing list for UJAM's e-mail newsletters, your e-mail address and selected newsletter list(s) are stored by us. We use this information solely for purposes of dispatching newsletters. Data sets are used to analyze system performance for statistical purposes. We neither pass on this data to third parties nor use it for any other purposes of our own. 

We offer you the opportunity to control whether we share your Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may request that we do so at the time you register to become a member of the UJAM Site or at any time thereafter by accessing and updating your privacy settings through your profile page. In addition, if you have previously authorized us to do, you may request that we no longer share your Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes by accessing and updating your privacy settings through your profile page. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any third party to whom we were authorized to disclose your Personal Data prior to processing your request. 

We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security. 

The UJAM Site may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such other web site (whether accessed through an advertisement, service, or content link) and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such web sites.
