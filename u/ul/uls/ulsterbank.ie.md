# Ulster Bank: Privacy

We are committed to protecting your privacy during your visits to our website and recognise our responsibility to hold your information securely and confidentially.

You can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. We measure and analyse non-identifying, aggregate usage data in order to administer the site, and to constantly improve the quality of our service and site performance.

We collect personal information when you apply for products or transact on our website. We generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. For details of how we process your personal information, please refer to your product terms and conditions.

We may use the personal information you provide, or which we collect via this website, for the purpose of providing more relevant content to you.

We also work with third parties to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on other websites.

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet.

We use them to:

  * collect anonymous information that will help us understand visitors' browsing habits on our website; 
  * compile statistical reports on website activity, e.g. number of visitors and the pages they visit; 
  * temporarily store any information which you may enter in tools, such as calculators or demonstrations on our website; 
  * remember information about you when you visit our site. We may need to do this to provide some of our services.



We use two types of cookie:

**Session cookies** \- these are temporary and are deleted as soon as you close your browser.

**Persistent cookies** \- these are stored on your computer until they expire or you remove them. For example, a persistent cookie may be used to remember that we have previously asked a visitor to complete an online survey. This would prevent you from being asked to complete the same survey every time you visit the site.

We do not use cookies to track your use of the internet after you leave our site, nor do we store any personal information in them that others could read and understand.

## Managing cookies

You can usually configure your internet browser to warn you each time a new cookie is about to be stored on your computer so that you may make a decision whether to accept or reject it. 

For example, if you reject the 'tc.ulsterbank.ie' cookie we will not store any data allowing us to tailor our content to reflect your unique circumstances.

Please refer to your internet browser's help section for specific instructions.
