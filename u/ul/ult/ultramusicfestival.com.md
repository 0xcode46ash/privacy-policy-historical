# Privacy Policy - Ultra Music Festival

**Effective Date: September 28, 2015**

[www.ultramusicfestival.com](http://www.ultramusicfestival.com/) (the “Site”) is owned and operated by Ultra Enterprises, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Ultra” “us” “we” “our”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains the information gathering, use and sharing practices for the Site, including what information is collected, how that information is acquired, maintained, stored, shared and/or used, and how you may access and update certain information you provide us. This Privacy Policy is independent from our offline personal data collection practices. This Privacy Policy will explain how we protect your information and what choices you have about how it is stored or used.

For some features and services available on the Site, we either collect and transfer personal information to a third party service provider or use a third party service provider to collect information for us.

In some cases, you also may visit third party websites through links on our Site who may collect and use your personal information and other non-personal information. We encourage you to review the policies of any such third parties before disclosing your personal information, as we have no control over, and are not liable for, their privacy practices.

## Information Collection. _How we collect information from you._

### Information You Provide:

  * When You Send Email Communications: When you contact us via email, the email address you use to communicate with us will be subject to this Privacy Policy. We may collect, store and use the email address you used to communicate with us to inform you about our products and services (unless you opt out of receiving such communications), to answer questions, resolve concerns or send you other information related to our Site and our services. We may also share your email address with our third party service providers, our sponsors, subsidiaries or any other affiliated company, and may sell or transfer your email address to any other third party. The contents of your email communications with us including any information, resumes, ideas, concepts or inventions, will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We may keep a record of your communications with us and use the contents of those communications for any purpose.
  * When You Sign Up for Newsletters, Create an Account or Register to Purchase Tickets: To use certain features of the site, you may be required to provide information such as your name, username, password, email address, mailing address, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, gender, age verification and/or country of residence (the “Personal Information”). You may view our Site without registering or submitting any Personal information, in which case we will be only collecting non-personal information through cookies and the recording of Log Data (discussed below).



### Third Party Service Providers and Affiliates:

  * Purchasing Tickets: When you purchase a ticket to Ultra Music Festival through our Site, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information, as well as credit card or debit card information, card expiration date, CVV code, billing address (collectively the “Payment Information”) and shipping address for processing your purchase. We use a third party ticketing service provider to facilitate and process all payments and ticket purchases. Therefore, the information you provide during the ticket payment process will be subject to the privacy practices of such third party service, which you can view [HERE](http://ultramusicfestival.com/payment-plan-terms-conditions). We do not receive Payment Information from our third party service provider, and therefore do not have access to, collect or store your Payment Information or other financial information. We do, however, receive aggregate data containing the zip codes of users who made purchases through the Site from our third party service provider. The aggregate data is not linked to any other information collected from you and is therefore anonymous.
  * Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys: We use third party services to help operate some of the services and other features offered on the Site such as any sweepstakes, contests and surveys. We receive all Personal Information you provide when participating in any of these services or features, as well as other non-personal information collected by our third party service providers by your use or access of these features.



### Information We Collect When You Interact With the Site:

  * Cookies: In an effort to provide improved and more customized service to Site visitors, we collect anonymous, non-personal information when you use or access the Site, send us emails, and respond to special promotions or newsletters. To do this, we, or a third party service provider such as Google Analytics, use cookies that automatically collect website usage data. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk that collects information about your activities on our Site. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions. These cookies enable us to better understand how users interact with our Site and may be used to acquire, maintain or store information such as the frequency of visits, whether the visitor has been to the site before, what other site referred the visitor to our Site, as well as the age, the gender and the interests of visitors, among other information (collectively the “Analytics Information”). Analytics Information allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Site (and select affiliated businesses partners’ and sponsors’ websites) and how users are interacting with our services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You may refuse the use of Google Analytics and other cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you change the applicable preferences to restrict cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. It also may be possible to link non-personal cookie information to Personal Information collected. See the following link for additional information about Google Analytics and how or whether your Personal Information may be used by Google Analytics: [(www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html)](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).
  * Log Data: When you access and use the Site, we may automatically receive and record information created by your interaction with the Site. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device, search terms and cookie information (the “Log Data”). We use your Log Data to help administer our website and to help diagnose problems and improve our website. We also use Log Data to help us improve your personal experience when interacting with our Site.



## Use of Information. _How we use information we collect from you._

In addition to any other uses stated in this Privacy Policy, the Personal Information, Analytics Information and/or Log Data (collectively, the “Information”) may be used to relay information, news and other updates to you, to contact you, market to you, deliver purchases and to improve our products and services. We may use the Information to help improve and administer our Site, to help diagnose problems with our Site, and improve your personal experience when interacting with our Site. We may use the Information to analyze how you interact with our Site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and Site traffic routine on our Site. We may also keep track of how you interact with links across our Site and services, including our email notifications, third-party services and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Site and services, enabling us to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. We may also receive information about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Site and services and our affiliates’ services.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure.

We may also share your information with potential advertisers, partners and sponsors. By using this Site, you are consenting to and authorizing such third parties the right to acquire, maintain, store, use and process your Information on the same terms set forth herein and on their servers.

  * Third Party Service Providers. We engage service providers to perform functions and provide us with services. We may share your Information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your Information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. These third parties include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to the operation and maintenance of our Site and services. These third parties may send newsletters or special promotions to you on our behalf, send emails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our behalf, conduct surveys, sweepstakes, contests, collect registration information from you or provide other services. Access to your Information by these third parties is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for them to perform their service(s) to us. Certain content, products and services offered to you through our Site are operated and served by third parties other than us, such as our ticket purchase service. If you purchase services or products through one of these third party websites, you will be purchasing it from the third party and not from us. Further, you should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review the privacy policy posted on the third party website to understand how the third party collects and uses your information.

This Privacy Policy will apply to your information if and when it is transferred to the new entity.
  * Law and Harm: We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal request such as a court order or subpoena, or to protect the safety of any person, or to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of any third party, without your consent. We may disclose your Information (i) to enforce compliance with, or to investigate, potential violations of this Privacy Policy, (ii) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, (iii) to detect potential or actual security breaches or (iv) to enhance security or to address technical issues relative to either the use of the Site or the attendance of our event.
  * Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information when you consent.
  * Unintentional Disclosure: We have commercially reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss or misuse of your Personal Information in electronic form that is under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that any of the Personal Information that you disclose or transmit through use of the Site will be secure from breaches, software malfunctions or other acts out of our control.
