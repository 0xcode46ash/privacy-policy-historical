# Ultimate Software Privacy Policy

The following statement describes the privacy practices for Ultimate Software.

The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (“Ultimate Software”) respects the privacy of our customers, employees, website visitors, and job applicants. We believe it is important for you to understand the type of information we collect about you and how that information is used. We recognize the need for appropriate safeguards and management of Personal Information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles Ultimate Software follows with respect to your Personal Information.

## Safe Harbor

Ultimate Software adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commission of Switzerland on the transfer of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland to the United States (the “Safe Harbor Agreement”). The Safe Harbor privacy principles are notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, and enforcement. More information about the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor program can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. 

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information received by Ultimate Software (including its Subsidiaries) in any format including electronic, paper, or verbal.

For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means any information collected by Ultimate Software that identifies or could be used by Ultimate Software to identify an individual. 

## Notice

_**How Personal Information is Collected**_ _Web Visitors_

Ultimate Software collects Personal Information about a visitor to our website only when the visitor chooses to provide such information.  On certain pages, for example, a visitor has the opportunity to provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, company, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  By supplying such information to Ultimate Software, a visitor can request details about Ultimate Software, including information about the company’s product line and investor information, or sign up for company-sponsored events or use the company’s support website.

No cookie will contain information that will allow anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of cookies on your computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or services on our websites. 

_Job Applicants and Employees_

Ultimate Software collects Personal Information from its employees and job applicants for, among other things, legitimate human resource business reasons such as payroll administration, filling employment positions, maintaining accurate benefits records, meeting governmental reporting requirements, security, health and safety management, performance management, company network access, and authentication. 

_Customers_

Ultimate Software collects Personal Information from our customers who use our solution.  The information may be collected through our SaaS solution, or by members of our support team who provide support to on-premise customers. The type of Personal Information collected is similar to the information collected under the “Job Applicants and Employees” paragraph, above. 

## Choice

**_Use of Your Personal Information_**  
We use your Personal Information to provide you with the services which Ultimate Software is contractually obligated to provide to you, or to assist you in completing a transaction, or communicate with you about our products or services. We use Personal Information from website visitors to respond to any inquiries such visitors make to our website and to provide you with related information of interest to you.  We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). 

Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release your Personal Information to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your Personal Information with that of any other customer or entity. 

## Onward Transfer

**_Sharing of Your Personal Information_**  
Ultimate Software may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on our behalf or to enhance our existing product and service offerings. Examples include providing marketing assistance, product, and service support. 

These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they are bound by confidentiality agreements before any information is provided to them, and they are restricted from using the information for other purposes. 

## Links to Non-Ultimate Software websites and Third Parties

Ultimate Software’s websites may contain links to third-party sites for your convenience and/or information. If you access those links, you will leave Ultimate Software’s website and be re-directed to a third-party site.  Ultimate Software does not control those sites or the privacy practices of those third-party sites, which may differ from Ultimate Software’s privacy practices.  We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party Web sites, and the personal data you choose to provide to third-party websites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website or company before submitting your Personal Information to them. 

## Access

Ultimate Software will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current, to its intended use.  We provide individuals with reasonable access to the Personal Information that they provide to us, as well as the ability to review and correct such information. 

To protect your privacy and security, we also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, before granting access to your Personal Information. In addition, we may limit or deny access to Personal Information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. 

## Security

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to allow only the appropriate use of your Personal Information, we utilize physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 

To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your Personal Information, Ultimate Software utilizes a variety of physical and logical access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, anti-virus, and backup systems. We use encrypted sessions when collecting or transferring sensitive data through our websites. 

We limit access to your Personal Information and data to those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such information.  Ultimate Software’s employees who have been granted physical access to your Personal Information will be made aware of their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so. 

## Data Integrity

Ultimate Software will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current, to its intended use. Ultimate Software will only use Personal Information in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
