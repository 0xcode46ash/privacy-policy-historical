5.3 Persistent cookies stay in the cookie file of your browser for longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

This is so they can track the effectiveness of their campaigns (including whether these ads are clicked on or viewed by users and later purchases by such users), avoid showing you the same ad repeatedly and display ads on this and other sites tailored to your preferences. We don't have any access to or control over these third party technologies as these aren't covered by this policy.
