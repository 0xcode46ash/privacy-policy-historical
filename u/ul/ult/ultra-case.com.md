# Ultra Case - Be Different Your iPhone 4 Case

Privacy Policy

**June 30, 2007 – Ultra-case respects and protects your right to privacy.**

In our continual quest for transparency and clarity in our data management practices, we have revised our Privacy Policy. Technology, regulatory requirements and data sharing practices continue to evolve. Our policy provides you with detail about how we manage the data you entrust with us.   
We believe that fair information processing is a requirement for organizations that have embraced the reality that the Network is the Computer and who have built communities that are comprised of individuals from around the globe. The principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement govern how we manage the personally identifiable information entrusted to us.   
Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy:

**User communications**

When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

**Personal information**

When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 

You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case we may not be able to provide those services to you. 

**Online Stores**

Visitors purchasing goods and services through one of our online stores may need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, delivering address, phone number and e-mail address.

**Personal Information Released To Outside Parties**

Any information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. Except as specified in this Policy, your information will not be shared with individuals outside the employ of Incase or with other companies.  
In some instances we may provide your name and delivery address to third parties that we use for delivering specific products to you. The process of fulfilling orders placed via the online store may also require Ultra-case to share your information with other third parties such as automated data processors and credit card processors. In such situation, your information is not retained by these third parties or used by these companies for any secondary reasons.   
As a good corporate citizen, Ultra-case complies with applicable law and legal obligations to respond to governmental, law enforcement and court requests for personal information and other information and data about our visitors and their transactions. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ultra-case uses cookies to help Ultra-case identify and track visitors, their usage of Ultra-case website, and their website access preferences. Ultra-case visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ultra-case’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Ultra-case’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Information security**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. 

We restrict access to personal information to Ultra-case employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

**Data integrity**

Ultra-case processes personal information only for the purposes which were collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date. If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time through this web site or at [privacy@ultra-case.com ](mailto:privacy@ultra-case.com)
