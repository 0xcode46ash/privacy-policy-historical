# ULTA.com | Help | Privacy & Security

**Privacy**

At ULTA.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your children online. If you are a child under the age of 13, you must get your parent's or guardian's consent, and provide that consent to ULTA.com, in the manner that ULTA.com directs herein, before you provide any information on the ULTA.com website. ULTA.com will not require, and in fact is prohibited by law from requiring, children to provide personal information in order to participate in a promotion or other activity on our site unless the information is necessary for such participation. 

**What We Collect and How We Use It**

When you place an order, we ask for your e-mail address, the mailing address(es) and phone number(s) (optional) where you'd like your items shipped, your billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. During the order process, you might also provide other shipping addresses (for sending gifts directly) or provide a gift tag message that's specific to a particular person. Collecting this information allows us to complete your order efficiently and to notify you of your order status. 

When you create an account with us, we offer the opportunity to become a member of the Club at ULTA.com, to receive future discounts and gifts and to receive ULTA.com e-mailings. You can also sign up for e-mailings by providing your e-mail address through our site services or our affiliated retail stores. 

When you participate in the Club at ULTA.com, subscribe to an ULTA.com newsletter, participate in an ULTA.com promotion, or ask to be notified when an out-of-stock product is available, we ask for your name and e-mail address (and certain other information in the case of the Club at ULTA). If you would like to stop receiving promotions, updates and/or special offers at any time, you may e-mail us at [service@ULTA.com](mailto:service@ULTA.com) with a statement requesting that you be deleted from the Club at ULTA.com membership list or that ULTA.com stop sending such promotions, updates and special offers to you. 

**We May Ask You for Special Information**

ULTA.com may ask customers to submit information, such as birthdays and product commentary, on a voluntary basis. We also may ask for information about our customer service. If we ask for this information, we will either tell you how the information will be used by us or we will use it in conformity with the User Agreement on the ULTA.com website. 

**Cookies**

Like most major websites, we use a feature of your web browser called a "cookie". Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use these cookie files to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our website and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit ULTA.com. To sum up, by using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience at ULTA.com better. To search our website and/or place an order from the ULTA.com website, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on. However, if you choose to disable the cookies feature of your web browser, you may not be able to place an order or otherwise use some or all of the ULTA.com website. 

Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. ULTA.com does not control use of these cookies and ULTA.com expressly disclaims responsibility for information collected through them. 

**Disclosure**

ULTA.com and its retail store affiliate, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., have formed a strategic partnership with a company known as Chelsea Interactive for technology and other services. Your information may be provided to Chelsea Interactive and strategic partners of ULTA.com and/or Chelsea Interactive. Chelsea Interactive has agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of your information, and ULTA.com will obligate all additional strategic partners of ULTA.com and/or Chelsea Interactive that receive any of your information to do the same. Of course, your information may also be provided to our retail store affiliate, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., which provides fulfillment services to ULTA.com. If you do not want us to share your information with Chelsea Interactive and/or Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. and/or other strategic partners, please notify us using the Opt Out procedure described below. 

As we continue to develop the business of ULTA.com, we might sell portions of the business or certain assets of the business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that ULTA.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

Finally, your information may be provided to third parties to the extent necessary to process and fill your order, reduce credit risk, protect against fraud, comply with applicable law, enforce or apply our user agreement and privacy policies. In some instances, we may also share non-identifying and aggregate information with third parties. However, except for our affiliated retail stores, the marketing and strategic partners of ULTA.com and/or Chelsea Interactive and except as otherwise discussed in this policy, ULTA.com does not share, sell or rent individual, identifying information to any third party at any time without your explicit consent. 

**Third Party Data Sharing**

The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. 

If you prefer we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please see the optout section below. 

If you agreed to receive email from our marketing partners, we will share with them your email address and the information described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. We will only share your e-mail address if you have opted in by checking the box on the registration page. Additionally, each email our partners send you will include a description of the simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mail. 

**Opt Out**

If you do not want us to share your information with Chelsea Interactive or other third parties, you may e-mail us at [service@ULTA.com](mailto:service@ULTA.com) with a statement requesting that your information not be provided to Chelsea Interactive and/or other third parties. Please specify in your e-mail whether you do not want us to share your information with Chelsea Interactive or third parties or both. Likewise, if you do not want us to share your information with ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., you may e-mail us at [service@ULTA.com](mailto:service@ULTA.com) with a statement requesting that we limit the use of your information by ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.; in that case, ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. will only be given the information needed to fulfill your order. However, to the extent that you do not want us to share your information with any third parties, it may impact our ability to serve you through our website. 

**Security**

ULTA.com shall protect the security of your personal information and credit card detail when you shop with us online using the security protections described below. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology – the industry standard – to encrypt the personal information and credit card detail you provide during the order process. 

To ensure the security of your personal information, you should always provide that information over a secure connection. You can check the existence of a secure connection in one of two ways: 

1\. Look at the URL in your web browser. Whenever you are connected to a secure server, that connection will be represented in the URL as "https," rather than "http." 

2\. Look at the lower left-hand corner of your web browser. You know you have an SSL connection if you see an unbroken key in Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), or a closed lock in Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above) or AOL (AOL 3.0 and above). 

While ULTA.com makes every effort to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, ULTA.com cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 

**Public Forums**

Please remember that any information you may disclose in public areas of our website or the Internet becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas. 

**To Contact Us or Change Your Information**

Do you have questions about our policies or any other customer service issue? Do you want to update your information for the Club at ULTA.com or change any other information about yourself? You can call us toll-free, from 10am to 10pm EST. Monday-Friday and 10am to 6pm EST. Saturday and Sunday, at 866-ULTA-COM or contact us online at [service@ULTA.com](mailto:service@ULTA.com).
