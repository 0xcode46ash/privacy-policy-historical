**_User Submissions_**  
Certain locations of the Web site may permit you to enter your email address and other contact information to receive further information about Ultra Mobile or for other purposes. Your submissions for these purposes are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to Ultra Mobile. Should you choose to submit information in response to these requests, Ultra Mobile may collect and use your name, email address, geographic location and other information submitted on the Web site to market Ultra Mobile's (including Affiliates') products and services.
