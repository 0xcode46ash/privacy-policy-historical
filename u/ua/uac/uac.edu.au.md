Under the National Privacy Principles, you are generally entitled to access the information we hold about you. In permitting access, we will require proof of identity to our satisfaction. The type of information you require will determine the length of time we take to respond but generally we will endeavour to satisfy your request immediately. We will generally provide your requested information using the same method of communication as that by which the information was requested. For example, a request by telephone will be answered by telephone and a request in writing will be answered in writing.

On occasion, we will ask you to put your request for information in writing. This would include instances where you require copies of material, or access to archived information or if the nature of the application makes it necessary for us to retain a record of your request.

You may be able to access some personal information through the UAC web site (www.uac.edu.au). Access to personal information via our web site requires the use of your unique login and PIN. No personal information is posted on the Internet. If you have any difficulties with finding the information you want in using our web site, please advise us.

In some circumstances, we may charge a service fee to retrieve your information, based upon our costs (internal and external) in locating the information and the form of response you require. If we intend to charge a fee, we will give you an estimate of the fee so that you can determine whether you want us to proceed with your request. We do not impose any charge for lodging a request for access. Under the National Privacy Principles, we are entitled to refuse you access to your information in certain circumstances. Should we refuse access, we will provide you with the reason(s).
