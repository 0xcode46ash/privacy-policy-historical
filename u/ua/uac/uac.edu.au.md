UAC is committed to upholding these principles and has implemented policies and procedures to ensure that these principles are met.

If you are a current NSW Higher School Certificate student, your Year 12 results will be held, along with Year 12 results from other states and territories in Australia, in an archive database at UAC. If you are eligible for a Universities Admission Index (UAI) or a Limited UAI, these will also be held in the database. Your results, including your UAI if you are eligible, will also be held on similar archives at tertiary admissions centres in other states in Australia. Results held on these archives will only be accessed by the relevant tertiary admission centre if you initiate an application for tertiary study through that centre, or if you submit an application for tertiary study directly with an institution participating in that centre.

Provision of your email address is optional. In collecting personal information UAC will only collect information for lawful purposes related to its function.  
  
**_How does UAC use this information?_**

UAC uses this information to process applications for admission to tertiary education institutions. This includes providing universities and other tertiary institutions with the information that you have provided to us.  
  
**_What about third parties?_**

   
---  
  
In order to perform certain business functions, UAC may contract the services of third parties, such as printing specialists. In these circumstances, where necessary, your information may be shared with these third parties for the express purpose of undertaking the specified service and for no other purpose. The same National Privacy Principles bind these contractors as UAC. 

Your information may also be shared with any authorised representative(s) that you have nominated, and with any organisations with which we are required by law to share the information.

UAC does not buy or sell mailing lists.  
  
**_How does UAC handle requests for information?_**

   
---  
  
Under the National Privacy Principles, you are generally entitled to access the information we hold about you. In permitting access, we will require proof of identity to our satisfaction. The type of information you require will determine the length of time we take to respond but generally we will endeavour to satisfy your request immediately. We will generally provide your requested information using the same method of communication as that by which the information was requested. For example, a request by telephone will be answered by telephone and a request in writing will be answered in writing.

On occasion, we will ask you to put your request for information in writing. This would include instances where you require copies of material, or access to archived information or if the nature of the application makes it necessary for us to retain a record of your request.

You may be able to access some personal information through UAC's web site (www.uac.edu.au). Access to personal information via our web site requires the use of your unique login and PIN. No personal information is posted on the internet. If you have any difficulties with finding the information you want in using our web site, please advise us.

In some circumstances, we may charge a service fee to retrieve your information, based upon our costs (internal and external) in locating the information and the form of response you require. If we intend to charge a fee, we will give you an estimate of the fee so that you can determine whether you want us to proceed with your request. We do not impose any charge for lodging a request for access. Under the National Privacy Principles, we are entitled to refuse you access to your information in certain circumstances. Should we refuse access, we will provide you with the reason/s.  
  
  
**_What do I do if the information UAC holds about me is incorrect?_**

   
---  
  
Please tell us. We want our records to be accurate, complete and up to date. Unless we disagree with you about the accuracy or completeness of a record, we will generally correct it upon request, or suggest alternative arrangements for updating our records. If, at any point, we disagree, we will provide you with a comprehensive response stating the reasons.  
  
**_How do I enquire about a breach of privacy?_**
