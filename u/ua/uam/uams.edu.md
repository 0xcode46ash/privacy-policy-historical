**UAMS Online Privacy Statement**

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has taken every reasonable precaution to protect information about charitable gifts to UAMS. UAMS will not retain information provided on donation forms for identification, tax deduction verification, and as required by law, such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, unless you voluntarily disclose that information to UAMS by making a gift using our online forms.

Information about gifts you make is not stored on an Internet database. In addition, UAMS and its contractors will not sell or distribute information about you or your charitable gifts to any other entity. E-mail containing information about a contribution is completely encrypted from the time you create it on your computer, during delivery, to reception, using the latest _P.G.P._ encryption technology.

In order to make our online donation service more valuable for our supporters, we may use the personally identifiable information such as name and email address gathered during the donation process to provide additional information about UAMS or to determine what you like and do not like about our services. You may opt out of receiving such e-mail messages at any time.
