# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what information Universal Audio, Inc. (“UA” or “we”) collects from individuals (‘you”) who visit the uaudio.com website (“uaudio.com” or the “Site”), purchase products through the Site, or who use software licensed by UA (the “Software”).  This Privacy Policy also explains how UA uses and maintains that information.  By using the Site, taking advantage of any Site offers or promotions, or otherwise participating in Site offerings, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, including UA’s rights to use your personal information, in each case as stated below.

Additional terms, if applicable, regarding the specific privacy rules associated with certain Software applications or services, or regarding any Site activity (such as a contest or sweepstake), will be set forth in the end user license agreement associated with that Software or the terms of participation associated with that activity, as applicable.

**1\. Types of Information Collected**

We collect two kinds of information (“Information”) through the Site or in connection with your purchase, activation and use of our products.  The first kind is Information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, home address, phone number, email address and credit card number ("PII").  We collect PII:

  * • If you decide to register on the Site;
  * • When you purchase products or license or download Software through the Site;
  * • When you participate in any Site activities, such as contests, or contribute to any Site forum or bulletin board;
  * • When you register for or participate in our Software Support websites and forums; or
  * • When you communicate with us through the Site, through other social media or through the Software.



The second kind of Information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites.  It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, mobile device, and pages viewed on UA.  Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally.

**2\. Collection of PII**

UA collects PII in the following ways:

  * • If you make purchases through the Site, you will be asked to provide certain PII to allow us to process the transaction.  UA has partnered with TrustCommerce, one of the Internet’s leading credit card gateway providers, to process credit card transactions on the Site.  Although UA does not itself store any of your credit card information, unless you opt out by checking the applicable box, TrustCommerce will store your credit card information to facilitate your future transactions on the Site.
  * • When you activate your Software, you will be asked to provide certain PII so that we can activate your account, validate your license and qualify you to receive user support.
  * • When you use our Web-based Software support offerings and when you register with or participate in our Support websites.
  * • When you notify us of a problem with the operation of the Site, or when you submit a suggestion, complaint, question, request, or any other e-mail correspondence, UA asks for your e-mail address so that you can receive a response.  This information will only be used to notify you of receipt of your submission and to address your comments or concerns.



We do not intend to collect PII from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.  If you are under 13, you should not be submitting any PII.  By providing us with your PII, you are representing that you are over 13 and you are authorizing our use and disclosure of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.

**3\. Use of PII**

First, you should know that UA will not sell your PII to third parties or provide your PII to third parties for their use in marketing or promotional campaigns.  UA will only use your PII for the specific purpose for which such Information was provided or as disclosed below.

UA may use your PII to notify you of upgrades to our Software, as well as to let you know about new services, products and other offers you may find valuable.  If we send such notifications by email, the email will only provide links to the download sites – we will never attach software or other documents to the email.  The links will always lead to our Site, never to a third-party site.  You can opt out of these emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in any email.

If you participate in any Site activities (such as contests or forums), your PII may be shared, disclosed or used in other ways, including when we announce contest winners and award prizes.  The rules provided by UA for the activities in which you choose to participate will inform you about these other uses of your PII.

UA may also use your PII to respond to questions you have about the Site and our products, and to provide you with Software Support.  We may also use your PII for internal purposes, such as auditing, data analysis and research to improve our products and customer experience.

From time to time, we may send optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and product needs.  The information collected will be treated as confidential, and will be used only by UA.

UA may provide your PII to third parties who process financial transactions you initiate through the Site or the UA Software or who work with UA to provide you with products or Software support.  Those third parties are bound by contract to protect your PII against unauthorized disclosure.

In the event that UA, or all or a portion of its business, is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the Information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale or other change of control.

And of course, UA reserves the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial or regulatory proceeding, court order, legal process or government request.

**4\. Collection of NPII**

Like many other websites, UA gathers and stores certain information automatically.  This anonymous technical and statistical information is collected whenever you visit our Site, when you purchase our products and when you activate our Software through cookies, beacons, tokens, or similar technologies.  This information may include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, mobile device type, UA Software version, Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on uaudio.com.  We use NPII to customize your experience on uaudio.com, to help us improve the quality of the Site and our products, and in connection with our provision of Software Support. 

**5\. Security**

We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Information from unauthorized access and improper use.  We keep Information on servers that are protected by firewalls and which we maintain or which are maintained by third parties under contract with us.  All Information is encrypted using SSL encryption when stored and when transmitted from our Site, and you must use an SSL-encrypted browser to make purchases from the Site.  From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods.  However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure, and we do not guarantee that your Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our technical, administrative or physical safeguards.  You can help protect the security of your Information by taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.  Keep your passwords private, and change them often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.

When you post on the UAD Unofficial Forum, any personal information you share will be accessible to other Site users, and may be read, collected or used by them.  You are solely responsible for the personal information you choose to submit to the UAD Unofficial Forum.

WE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**6\. Links from the Site and Software**

UA provides links to the websites, services and software of certain third parties **.**   If you link to any of these third party Web sites, services or software, this Policy will not apply to your use of those sites, services and software.  We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies.  UA shall have no responsibility or liability for your experience with, and the data collection and use practices of such third party sites and software.  All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party should be communicated to that third party.

**7.    International Users**

The Site is hosted in the United States.  If you are accessing the Site from the European Union, Asia or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from U.S. laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy Policy, you are transferring your personal information to the U.S. and you consent to that transfer.

**8\. Changes and Updates**

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically, and this will be reflected by the "last modified" notice below.  If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes and the updated Privacy Policy on the Site so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY FUTURE REVISIONS.
