# Privacy Policy

Please note that your personal information will be stored and processed on our secure servers located in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your country but UA will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.

UA will not sell or otherwise send your personal information to any third party not covered by a non-disclosure agreement except when required by law or court order, and except to transmit needed information in processing authorized purchase transactions.

**Store Policy:**

The UA secure store accepts Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover and Paypal as methods of Payment. If you do not wish to enter your credit card details via the internet, you may call UA during office hours to make a purchase via credit card or check over the phone.

In the event of a dispute or payment problem, please call our customer service promptly Toll-Free (US) at 1-877-MY-UAUDIO or 1-831-440-1176 so we can help resolve your problem.

**E-Mail:**

We occasionally send e-mail to customers to provide UA product-specific information. However, the e-mail will only provide links to the download sites -- we will never attach software or other documents to the e-mail. The links will always lead to either our web site or our FTP site, never to a third-party site. Customers can choose to not receive these e-mails, and we don't sell or share our mailing lists.

**Customer Service Correspondence:**

If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we may retain such information in the records of your account. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our User Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.

**Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data:**

From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and product needs. The information collected will be treated as confidential, used only by UA and its affiliate Kind of Loud Technologies, LLC.
