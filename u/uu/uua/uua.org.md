# UUA: Privacy Policy

This Website is owned and operated by the Unitarian Universalist Association. We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns. This policy may be changed or updated from time to time. If you have any questions please write to us at [web @ uua.org](mailto:web@uua.org).

_The first principle of the member societies of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) is that we will covenant to affirm and promote the inherent worth and dignity of every person. We believe that this principle impels us to protect the privacy of visitors to the UUA website._

**Personal Information**

We only collect personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, address, phone number, email address, credit card numbers. We do not require this information to obtain access to any part of our site. 

High grade encryption and https security protocols are used for collecting personal information associated with financial transactions.

The personal information we collect is only used by us to process a request that has been placed by the visitor. Typically this is in the form of an order for material from our Bookstore, but it may on occasion include other voluntary submittals of similar information for survey purposes or for event registrations. 

We do not sell or rent this personal information to other organizations. However, website users should be aware that posting to the website's various bulletin boards may result in their name and email address being acquired by other parties. The UUA cannot prevent this from happening, since the bulletin boards are open to public viewing. Bulletin board posts may also be accessed as the result of a web search. The UUA also cannot prevent this from happening. 

**Credit Card Information**

The UUA accepts payments for products or donations through our web site. We make every effort to protect the safety and security of your transaction. We use high-grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. 

Information is also provided on for those who wish to make contributions or purchases through the mail or via fax. 

**We Care About Doing It Right**

In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information you share with us, the UUA works to accurately process your information. However, if inaccuracies occur, the UUA will make every effort to correct them in a timely manner. To report any web site inaccuracies or for questions about UUA's Internet Privacy Policy please email us at [web @ uua.org](mailto:web@uua.org) .
