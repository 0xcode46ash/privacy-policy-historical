[](http://208.132.226.111/EA-Confirmation) Electronic Arts and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected about you. We have adopted a corporate wide Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide. 

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located to your right confirms that EA is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible, we have undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our web sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of the privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB. 

ESRB Privacy Online is a third-party seal provider whose mission is to protect consumers' online privacy and make the Internet a secure, reliable, and private place to share information and conduct business. ESRB Privacy Online promotes and enforces established principles and guidelines for fair information practices that include requirements of full disclosure, notice, and informed consent. 

Whenever you visit a web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of: 

  * Exactly what personal information may be collected and by what means 
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting you personal information 
  * How this information may be used, including, who-if anyone-it might be shared with 
  * The consequences -if any-resulting from your refusal to provide personal information 
  * How you can access and, if necessary, change the personal information a company maintains 
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity 
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints

Electronic Arts currently operates the following web sites:

In addition, Electronic Arts owns several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or may not be listed above. Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by Electronic Arts or its subsidiaries, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. Furthermore, from time to time EA may employ third parties who may collect personal information on EA's behalf. In such cases, such third parties will be instructed by EA to comply with the EA Privacy Policy as set forth herein. 

**What information is collected?**  
Electronic Arts only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contest registration, (2) warranty registration, (3) player match up services, (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation, and (5) purchasing of goods and services through our online store. Personal information collected may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address and birthdate. We do not require this information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration. 

Visitors purchasing goods and services through our online store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. 

**A special note about children 12 years old and under**  
Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under. In order for children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission from a parent or guardian (opt-in). A copy of our permission form can be found at <http://www.ea.com/privacy/parentpermission.cfm>. This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax at (650) 628-5972 or by mailing to Electronic Arts, **Privacy Policy Administrator** , 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065. 

**What about cookies?**  
Certain of our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and for other purposes. (Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites.) Certain of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. Some consumer data is shared with the advertising companies. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas will not function properly if you do so. 

**What happens to the information provided?**  
Electronic Arts does not disclose any personally identifying information about registered children under **18 years of age** to third parties, _regardless of parental consent_. 

When you register on an Electronic Arts' online site, you will be asked to provide personally identifying information. The information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may provide your personal information to such third parties. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. 

Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs 

**Opt-out provision**  
When we first collect information about you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with parties outside of Electronic Arts or its subsidiaries (except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority). In addition, if you do not want Electronic Arts to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt out at the time of registration or information collection. If, at a later date, you choose to have your name removed from our database, you can do so by sending an e-mail to [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com), by calling (650) 628-5982 or by sending a fax to (650) 628-5972. In Europe please send an email to [privacy-uk@ea.com](mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com). 

**Safeguarding your personally identifiable information**  
We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information. 

**Review, correction and deletion of information from our files**  
If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct, or should you wish to have your name removed from our records, please contact us at [privacy_policy@ea.com](mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com) or call (650) 628-5982 or send a fax to (650) 628-5972 , and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. In Europe please send an email to [privacy-uk@ea.com](mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com). 

By using this site, you signify your assent to the Electronic Arts Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right to make changes in this policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.
