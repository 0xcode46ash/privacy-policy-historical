# Privacy - About the University @ UOW

#### **What is Privacy?**

There is no clear definition of privacy in the Commonwealth and NSW privacy laws that apply to the University.  According to [Privacy NSW,](http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/Lawlink/privacynsw/ll_pnsw.nsf/pages/privacy_index) privacy should not be confused with confidentiality or secrecy, as privacy tends to be a broader concept of fair dealing with a person’s information, including collection, use, storage, security and disclosure.  See our [Privacy Information Sheet](https://web.archive.org/content/groups/public/@web/@fin/@lcu/documents/doc/uow061010.pdf) for more information.  You should also refer to the University of Wollongong’s [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/content/groups/public/@web/@gov/documents/doc/uow038289.pdf).

####  **What are the University’s Obligations Regarding Privacy**

See our [Privacy Information Sheet](https://web.archive.org/content/groups/public/@web/@fin/@lcu/documents/doc/uow061010.pdf) for more information on the 12 rules of information privacy that the University must comply with.

The current [Student Privacy and Disclosure Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20121219143619id_/http%3A//www.uow.edu.au/about/privacy/ssLINK/6752/UOW089606) lists the primary and secondary uses of personal information collected from students.

Broadly, the University has obligations to collect, store, secure, use and only disclose personal or health information in certain ways that promote responsible and transparent collection. 

Upon collection of information the University should describe how it will use that information, and should only use that information for that purpose, or a related purpose.  Information should be stored securely, and access must be given to the information provider to update or correct information.

The University should NOT disclose a person’s personal or health information unless:

  * that person has provided clear and written consent to do so;
  * a court or similar body has ordered the information’s release;
  * a law enforcement agency is requiring information and certain tests are met; or
  * the disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of that person or another person.



Breach of the Privacy Laws by unlawful means is a serious matter, and could expose the University to an internal privacy investigation, Privacy Commissioner Investigation and/or adverse media reports. 

A University Privacy Officer (listed below) should be consulted before any action is taken.  Please direct any questions or concerns to a University Privacy Officer listed below.

####  **A Privacy Survival Guide for Young People**

To help young people make informed decisions about their privacy, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has produced private i, a privacy survival guide.

private i covers the privacy issues you may face such as: online social networking, identity theft, the scanning of ID documents at pubs and clubs, ‘blacklists', online shopping, dealing with telemarketers, and responding to requests for personal information. It also discusses the pitfalls to avoid, and where to get help if your privacy has been affected. 

To download private I, visit <http://www.privacy.gov.au/topics/youth>

#### **Privacy Complaints**

Any student, staff member or member of the public who is concerned about how their personal or health information is being handled by the University should contact a privacy officer in the Legal Services Unit of the University.  The privacy officers will discuss your concerns or complaints and endeavour to reach a suitable resolution, referring to any existing University policies or complaint handling guidelines.

Where an individual wishes to make a formal request for a review of the University's conduct in the handling of his/her personal or health information, the [Privacy Complaint Internal Review Application Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20121219143619id_/http%3A//www.uow.edu.au/about/privacy/ssLINK/6752/UOW022144) is to be completed and lodged with the Legal Services Unit
