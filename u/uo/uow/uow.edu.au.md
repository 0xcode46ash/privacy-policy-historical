# Privacy - University of Wollongong

## What is privacy?

According to the Information and Privacy Commission, privacy can mean the right to a sense of personal freedom, the right to be left alone and most importantly, the right to have information about oneself handled in a fair and proper manner.

## Privacy legislation

UOW must handle your personal and health information in accordance with NSW's [Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1998/133/part2 "Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998") _ _ and [Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002](https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2002/71 "Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002"). These Acts set out the privacy principles that UOW must abide by when it collects, stores, uses and discloses personal and health information.

### UOW's privacy obligations

UOW is committed to protecting and maintaining the privacy of your personal and health information. UOW's [Privacy Policy](https://www.uow.edu.au/legal/privacy/UOW038289.html "Privacy Policy") and [Privacy Management Plan](https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@gov/documents/doc/uow139886.pdf "Privacy Management Plan") demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and provide details of:

  * the ways in which UOW complies with its privacy obligations;

UOW's [Privacy Information Sheet](https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@fin/@lcu/documents/doc/uow061010.pdf "Privacy Information Sheet") provides a summary of the information protection principles that UOW must comply with when handling your personal and health information.

### Collection

UOW collects your personal and/or health information for lawful purposes that are directly related to UOW's functions or activities.  When UOW collects your personal and/or health information, you will be informed as to why it is being collected, what will be done with it, whether it's required by law and your rights of access to and correction of that information.

The [Student Privacy and Disclosure Statement](https://web.archive.org/privacy/student-privacy-and-disclosure-statement/) lists the intended use/disclosure of personal and/or health information collected from students. This Statement also provides details of how students can request access or seek amendments to their personal and/or health information.

The [Privacy Collection Statement for Recruitment and Employee Records](https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@fin/@lcu/documents/doc/uow156836.pdf "Privacy Collection Statement for Recruitment and Employee Records") provides details of the types of information collected from employees and/or prospective employees, how that information is held and used by UOW,  circumstances where it may be disclosed and details of how the employee can access his/her record. 

The [Privacy Statement for UOW's alumni, donors and members of the community](https://web.archive.org/alumni/privacy/) provides details of the way that it connects with and handles the information of its alumni, donors and community when engaging with UOW.

### Security

UOW takes all reasonable steps to protect your personal and/or health information against loss, misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

UOW's [Data Breach Response Plan](https://intranet.uow.edu.au/legal/infosheets/index.html) provides a consistent set of procedures that UOW will follow in the event of a data breach. This plan will ensure that appropriate steps are taken to respond promptly and appropriately, in accordance with the NSW Information and Privacy Commission best practice.

### Disclosure

UOW will NOT disclose your personal or health information unless:

  * you have provided clear and written consent to do so;
  * a court or similar body has ordered the information’s release;
  * a law enforcement agency is requiring information and certain tests are met; or
  * the disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to your life or health or that of another person.
