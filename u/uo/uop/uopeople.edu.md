Policy number:          04022016
Effective date:         February 04, 2016
Last reviewed date:     February 29, 2016

Summary:                This policy governs the collection of personally identifiable information
                        through the University of the People website.
Policy Statement
University of the People is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with this privacy
policy, which applies to the university of the people website, its related websites, and to any
services and content therein ("website"), and governs collection of personally identifiable
information through the website.
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. By using the website, you give your consent to
university of the people’s data practices and understand that all personally identifiable
information that you submit may be processed by university of the people in the manner and
for the purposes described herein.
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions set forth herein, do not use the website.
Collection of Personal Information
To apply for admission to University of the People (“UoPeople”, or the “University”), you must
submit personally identifiable information to the UoPeople website (“Website”). “Personally
identifiable information” refers to data that allows University of the People to identify you,
such as your name, gender, mailing address, telephone number, date and country of birth,
government-issued identification number, e-mail address, and other personal information.
If you submit personally identifiable information through any of UoPeople’s Communications
Services (as described in the University’s Terms of Use), that information may be collected and
used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Use of Personal Information
By submitting your personally identifiable information to the Website, you understand and
agree that UoPeople may collect, use, transfer, and disclose your personally identifiable
information as described in this Privacy Policy. The UoPeople will use your information for
internal purposes including, but not limited to, academic and financial advising, record-keeping
and tracking. Such use may involve transfer of personally identifiable information to servers
located outside the country from which you access the Website.


You acknowledge that the University may transfer your personally identifiable information from
one geographical area to another located anywhere in the world, as the University may deem
reasonably necessary or appropriate for its administrative purposes. If you are a resident of the
European Economic Area, you agree that the University may transfer your personally
identifiable information outside of the European Economic Area, including to the University’s
affiliated institutions or third-party service providers. You consent to any such transfers as a
condition of your communications with, application to and/or enrollment with the University.
If you subscribe to our newsletter, we may also use your information to inform you of new
services UoPeople will be providing, inform you of scholarship applications and academic
programs provided by third parties, and send you requested information and promotional
materials for marketing purposes and research.
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
The University automatically collects non-personal information about your computer hardware
and software for the purpose of improving the administration and content of the Website,
facilitating use of the University’s Website by its users, and to properly diagnose server
problems and other issues.
The University may contract with third party providers to assist in better understanding visitors
to the Website. Third party providers are prohibited from using any information they collect on
behalf of UoPeople for any purpose other than helping the University conduct and improve its
services to you.
Information Sharing
The University does not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to third
parties. Personally identifiable information collected in connection with applications for
admission is, however, collected by a third-party service provider that hosts the Website, and
that information is released to application reviewers who may include University employees,
contractors, volunteers and other parties. These individuals are prohibited from using your
personally identifiable information except in connection with UoPeople services and any other
products and/or services you have requested, and they are required to maintain the
confidentiality of your information.
The UoPeople may disclose your personally identifiable information, without notice, (i) if
required to do so by law, or (ii) in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect or
defend the rights, system, network, property or personal safety of the University, its personnel
or its students. The UoPeople may disclose your personally identifiable information, with prior
notice, to a potential or actual partner or buyer in connection with a merger, acquisition, or any
form of sale of some or all of the University’s assets.


The University requires opt-in consent (meaning, your express permission) to share any
sensitive personally identifiable information, such as medical information or information
concerning race or ethnicity, political or religious beliefs, and sexuality. Educational records,
including your transcript, will be disclosed to third parties only as described below.
Security of your Personal Information
The University maintains reasonable measures to protect your personally identifiable
information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The University stores the personally
identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled environment that has
implemented protections against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. UoPeople has
implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets,
including, but not limited to, authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. These
security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day
operations of the Website as part of University’s continuing commitment to the security of
electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.
For website security purposes and to maintain the availability of the Website for all users, the
University employs software to monitor traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or
change information or otherwise damage the Website. When personally identifiable
information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected
through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
The University, however, cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to
defeat the measures described in this section or use your personally identifiable information for
improper purposes. Nothing in this Privacy Policy or in the University's Terms of Use shall be
deemed a guarantee, contract, or warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, regarding
the security of your personally identifiable information.
Educational Records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 was designed to protect the
privacy of educational records, establish the rights of students to inspect and review their
educational records, and provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading
information through informal and formal hearings. While FERPA does not apply to the
University, since it is not a federally-funded institution, the University nonetheless strives to
meet FERPA’s provisions to the extent reasonably feasible.
The University will not disclose a student's educational record without obtaining the student's
prior written consent, except that a student's educational record may be disclosed (i) to other
school officials, including teachers with a legitimate educational interest and contractors,
consultants, volunteers, or other parties to whom UoPeople has outsourced educational or


institutional services or functions; (ii) to parents of a dependent student, as defined in section
152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; (iii) to accrediting organizations; (iv) in compliance
with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; or (v) for any other reason permitted under 34
CFR § 99.31.
The University depends on the accuracy of the records submitted by its students. False
information on an application, or any other act to intentionally mislead or misinform
instructional personnel or administrators, is grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal
from the University. Students seeking access or amendment of their educational records should
contact the Office of Student Services at Student.Services@uopeople.edu.
Updating your Data
Upon receipt of your written request and sufficient data to permit the University to identify
your personal information, the University will make reasonable efforts to disclose to you the
information it holds about you. UoPeople will also make reasonable efforts to correct, amend
or delete any personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the
necessary changes. UoPeople may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive
or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are
extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
Although neither this website nor any of the University’s services are intended for children
under 13 years of age, the University complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
of 1998 (“COPPA”) and does not knowingly collect any personal information online from
children under the age of 13.
Use of Cookies
The UoPeople Website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A
cookie is a small data file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. The purpose of
a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
personalize Website pages, or apply for admission to UoPeople, a cookie helps the University
recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
your personal information, such as your name and mailing address. When you return to the
Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can more easily use
the UoPeople features.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
cookie to you.


By using the Website, its related websites and other services, you hereby agree to the use of
cookies as described herein. Note that most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Website.
Google Analytics
The University uses Google Analytics to collect information about use of the Website. The
University uses the data it receives from Google Analytics to improve the Website, and does not
combine the IP address collected by Google Analytics with your name or other identifying
information that you may enter on the Website. UoPeople cannot control Google’s use of the
information it gathers; however, Google's right to use and share information collected by
Google Analytics about your visits to the UoPeople Website is restricted by the Google
Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from
recognizing you on return visits to this site by deleting its cookie or disabling cookies on your
browser.
Your California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Notices
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of a company who are California
residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personally identifiable
information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please
send an email to info@uopeople.edu. Please note that the University is only required to
respond to one request per customer each year.
Note that the University does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
The Microsoft CRM
The University’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is hosted by Microsoft.
There is a seamless transition from the University’s main website to the CRM. You enter the
CRM every time you work on your application to the University or otherwise log in to the
Student Portal. The CRM processes and maintains all UoPeople applications, student records
such as course registration history and grades, and data related to payment history such as
invoices and tracking numbers. Note that the CRM does not store any of your personal bank
account or PayPal information.
Microsoft is not allowed to use your personally identifiable information other than for the
provision of services to the University or as otherwise permitted by law. For more information
about the Microsoft Dynamics CRM, you can review the security and privacy pages at the
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Trust Center and the Microsoft Privacy & Cookies page.
The Moodle Learning Platform


All of the University’s courses, classroom discussions, assignments, testing, the academic
advising messages system, and student and faculty forums are conducted through Moodle, an
open-source learning platform. There is a seamless transition from UoPeople’s main website to
the University’s Moodle platform.
No one outside the UoPeople community is permitted to access the UoPeople Moodle
platform. However, the UoPeople Moodle site administrators have access to nearly everything
in the system and certain private information is also accessible by other UoPeople students,
faculty and staff:
    1. UoPeople profile page. Every UoPeople student has a profile page in Moodle, which
         contains their first and last name, email address (optional), profile picture (optional) and
         description (optional). This information is visible to classmates for each course in which
         a student is enrolled, and to all students, faculty and staff through the Academic
         Advising Virtual Office. UoPeople profile pages are NOT available to the general public.
    2. UoPeople discussion forums. Since UoPeople is based on the peer-learning model, the
         University makes great use of discussion forums in its courses. Anything posted in a
         discussion forum is visible to the instructor and to all students enrolled in that course.
         For large classes that are divided into groups, only members of your group can see your
         posts. Your posts will include your full name and profile picture if you have chosen to
         upload it to the system.
    3. UoPeople peer-assessed assignments. All assignments assessed by other students in a
         particular course are submitted anonymously. Unless you put your name on your peer-
         assessed assignment, which is not a requirement, only instructors and administrators
         will be able to see who has evaluated your assignment.
    4. Private messaging system. Only the sender and receiver can view the content of
         messages sent through the Moodle privacy messaging system.
If you withdraw from the University, your account will be disabled and will no longer visible to
students and instructors. Old and inactive accounts are usually deleted after four years of
nonuse.
Note that if you choose to create a public profile on the moodle.org or moodle.net sites, which
are outside the UoPeople Moodle platform, your information may become public and the
Moodle Privacy Policy shall apply.
The UoPeople Yammer Enterprise Network
UoPeople’s Yammer Enterprise Network provides a collaborative environment for UoPeople
students, faculty, alumni, staff and volunteers from throughout the globe (“UoPeople


Community”) to connect and share meaningful information. Note that there is a seamless
transition from UoPeople’s main website to the University’s Yammer Network.
By enrolling in UoPeople’s Yammer Network, you understand and agree that your personal
profile and any content you post will be visible to other members of the UoPeople Community
and to anyone outside the community who manages to log in to the UoPeople Yammer
Network. Confidential student information and other sensitive or private content should not be
posted on the Yammer Network.
Although UoPeople administrators monitor all posts and comments to the UoPeople Yammer
Network, you are ultimately responsible for the content you post and UoPeople has a right and
obligation to report any user who posts illegal content and threats of violence to the
authorities.
Prior to enrollment in the UoPeople Yammer Enterprise Network, users should review
Microsoft’s Yammer Privacy Statement and UoPeople’s Yammer Terms of Use.
