# USA for UNHCR

The US Association for UNHCR strives to protect the privacy of the financial and personal information that contributors provide. We commit to taking every possible step to insure that the information is safeguarded at every stage, and is used only for the purposes designated by donors.

In order to process credit card transactions online, it is necessary to collect some information. Typically, the type of credit card, the name of the donor, the amount of the donation, the number of the card and expiration date are required to process any transaction.

In addition, USA for UNHCR collects a telephone number and email address from those individuals agreeing to provide them, in case we must contact donors because of an inaccurate name, credit card number or expiration date. Failure to provide a telephone number or email address may result in a donation not being posted.

USA for UNHCR also collects a mailing address from individuals willing to provide one. From time to time we mail information about the activities of our association to those who are interested in worldwide refugee activities of UNHCR. We may also solicit funds to support specific UNHCR programs in these mailings. We also use mailing addresses to provide written acknowledgments of all contributions. The IRS will disallow any charitable contributions of $250 or more that is not substantiated by a "contemporaneous written acknowledgement." In order to best serve our donors, USA for UNHCR attempts to provide these acknowledgements.  
  
In an effort to decrease fundraising costs related to acquiring new donors, USA for UNHCR occasionally exchanges name and address information about some of its supporters with likeminded organizations.  Donors who would prefer that their names not be exchanged  should inform us by calling 800-770-1100, or by sending an email to [info@usaforunhcr.org](mailto:info@usaforunhcr.org).  USA for UNHCR will make every effort to prevent the personal information of donors who so request from being exchanged.

If at any time a donor wishes to have his or her name deleted from our records, we comply as quickly as possible. For further information, please call (800) 770-1100.
