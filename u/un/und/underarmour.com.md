About UA 

What is the mission of Under Armour?

How can I become an Under Armour model? 

From time to time, Under Armour seeks models for its online and print catalogs, as well as for product fashion shows. Some models are sought through local casting calls and others through local talent agencies. Please contact your local talent agency or continue to check our website for information as it becomes available. 

How did Under Armour begin? 

Under Armour started with a simple plan to make a superior t-shirt; a shirt that provided compression and wicked perspiration off your skin rather than absorb it; a shirt that worked with your body to regulate temperature and enhance performance. 

Founded in 1996 by former University of Maryland football player Kevin Plank, Under Armour is the originator of performance apparel and gear engineered to keep athletes cool, dry and light throughout the course of a game, practice or workout. The technology behind Under Armour's diverse product assortment for men, women and youth is complex, but the program for reaping the benefits is simple: wear HeatGear® when it's hot, ColdGear® when it's cold, and AllSeasonGear® between the extremes.

How to Order 

How do I place an order? 

You can place an order online on our secure website located at [www.underarmour.com](http://www.underarmour.com/). But if you prefer to order by telephone, you may purchase website or catalog merchandise by calling 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687). A member of our customer service team will gladly take your order. 

How can I tell if an item is in stock online? 

Once you've selected the style, you can determine what color/size is in stock by first selecting the color (1. Select Color), and then the size (2. Select Size). If the size you want is not listed for the selected color, it is not available. Under Armour strives to have the latest and greatest styles, colors and sizes at your disposal. However, we may experience shortages of stock due to overwhelming popularity of a particular style, color or size. Our website is designed to feature 'real-time' inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase. If the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call us at 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687) so that we may help you find a similar product.

How is the sales tax calculated for my order? 

All online retailers must collect sales tax from customers having goods delivered into states in which the company has nexus. Nexus is defined as having substantial presence in a state. Under Armour has nexus in states where we have representatives or assets. Under Armour currently has nexus in CA, CO, FL, IL, MD, MI, NY, TX and WA and is therefore required to collect sales tax on web and phone orders shipped into these states. You will be charged the appropriate state, local and district sales tax based on the location your order is shipped. If your order is being shipped to a state not listed above, Under Armour will not charge you sales tax on your order. Under Armour charges sales tax on all taxable products, including freight in CO, FL, IL, NY, TX and WA. 

What methods of payment do you accept? 

Under Armour currently accepts credit and debit cards from Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Credit/debit cards must be issued by a U.S. institution and must have a U.S. billing address. For orders sent through the mail to Under Armour, we accept only credit cards originating from U.S.-based financial institutions. Please ensure that the billing address on file with the credit card issuing bank is the same address you enter when ordering. We do not accept personal checks, money orders or cash payments.  


ATTENTION DEBIT CARD USERS:

When using a debit card, your bank may remove or set aside the necessary funds to cover the order for a period of up to five business days. Under Armour does not collect payment until the order has shipped from our fulfillment center.

We also accept Under Armour-issued gift cards as payment for merchandise. Please refer to the above FAQs regarding gift cards for detailed instructions on how to purchase and redeem gift cards. Currently, Under Armour is unable to accept Visa, Master Card or American Express gift certificates.

I am seeing extra charges on my credit card. What does this mean? 

Because Under Armour does not charge for items until they ship, we use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment. In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a ‘pre-authorization’ is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds. Every time an order is submitted on our website or in our operating system, our system contacts your bank and asks it to reserve funds from your account until your order is shipped. This amount, although not the final amount that will be charged, may appear on your credit/debit card statement as a pending charge and places a temporary hold against your credit/debit card for the total amount of the order. Your available bank balance should be sufficient to cover any transactions posting to your account after the pre-authorization. Please note that the transaction description will show as "UNDER ARMOUR." Most authorizations expire within five to seven days; however the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization. The final credit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call us at 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687). 

Do you offer discounts on bulk orders? 

We're sorry, but we do not offer discounts on bulk orders.

Can I change or cancel an order after I have placed it? 

We are able to assist with most order change or cancellation requests up until shipment of your order. If we are unable to cancel the order we will offer alternative solutions. Please contact customer service at 888.7.ARMOUR so that one our representatives can assist you. We cannot accept e-mail requests for order changes or cancellations.

I didn't receive a confirmation email after I placed my order. 

Please confirm your email address when creating your account. If you are using your workplace email address, be aware that many corporations use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could hamper delivery of our confirmation email to you. Feel free to call us at 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687) so that we can assist you.

What are your security and privacy policies? 

We go to great lengths to protect your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information. When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give a pop-up message stating that you're about to enter or leave a secure area. Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the internet. Underarmour.com has also earned a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc. When you see Verisign's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted to our secure servers. Ultimately your account and personal information is protected by the password you provided when you created your Underarmour.com account. Always keep this password and login information private, and never share it with anyone. If you prefer to order by telephone, you may purchase online merchandise by calling 1.888.7.ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687). A member of our customer service team will gladly take your order.

It will read i.e. FW081100200 or on older styles FW060375. The first four characters reference the season of the style (ex. FW06=Fall/Winter 2006) the last 7 (on new styles) or 4 (on older styles) reference the style number. You can search this style number on our site to find exactly what you are looking for.

We currently offer up to XXXL in limited styles only. Please note that these products may be more expensive.

Can you customize my Under Armour gear?

• Please note that the temps, PSIs and flash (dwell) times may vary if a printer is using another type of heat seal.

When you see Verisign's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted to our secure servers. Ultimately your account and personal information is protected by the password you provided when you created your Underarmour.com account.

**Privacy policy:**

To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a responsible manner. We have posted this privacy policy on our website to let you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information. As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of advances in technology, our privacy policy may change. Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information. 

The remainder of our privacy policy is further detailed in the following FAQs.

What are Cookies and how do you use them? 

A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) when you enter our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. 

We use cookies to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the website you visited immediately before navigating to Underarmour.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. 

We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management. 

We may also use single pixel images on our website. This technology tells us more about browsing and buying activity within Underarmour.com, but none of your personal information (name, address, email address, payment information, etc.) will be received or shared with our third party service providers. 

The use of cookies is a standard internet practice and most major websites use them. When shopping on Underarmour.com, cookies allow us to manage the contents of your cart. 

Please note:  
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from our website.

A note to our customers using Internet Explorer 6.0:   
If you are using Internet Explorer 6.0 and are having difficulty purchasing from our website, please check your privacy settings in your browser and set them to "Medium." If you do not wish to change your privacy settings to "Medium" and you are currently using the "Medium High" or "High" settings, you may choose to override your current cookie handling practices for individual websites that you specify. As always, you may purchase online merchandise by calling 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687). One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order. 

What are your Registration and E-mail Subscription policies? 

To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with Underarmour.com. Using your email address and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete or change information. 

If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to close your browser at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer. 

We encourage users to create a registered account on our website. The benefit of having a registered account on Underarmour.com is having the ability to track shipments, view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password. When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information such as what sports you play. 

The alternative to having a registered account is being a "Guest" visitor. As a "Guest," you do not have access to tracking, past orders, or the benefit of storing your billing and shipping information on our site. 

**Emails:**

Each registered user has the choice of receiving announcements and promotions from Underarmour.com via email. You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. Each time you receive an email from Under Armour, you will be given the opportunity to "opt-out," or stop receiving them. If you choose to "opt-out," we will stop sending you emails. Please note, however, that some email promotions are prepared well in advance. We appreciate your patience in giving us time to carry out your request. You may "opt-out" by selecting the link, "OPT-OUT OF MAILING LIST" at the bottom of any Under Armour email. 

Under Armour does not sell its mailing list or customers' email addresses. 

What is your credit card pre-authorization policy? 

Because Under Armour does not charge for items until they ship, we use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment. In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a ‘pre-authorization’ is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds. Every time an order is submitted on our website or in our operating system, our system contacts your bank and asks it to reserve funds from your account until your order is shipped. This amount, although not the final amount that will be charged, may appear on your credit/debit card statement as a pending charge and places a temporary hold against your credit/debit card for the total amount of the order. Your available bank balance should be sufficient to cover any transactions posting to your account after the pre-authorization. Please note that the transaction description will show as "UNDER ARMOUR." Most authorizations expire within five to seven days; however the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization. The final credit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call us at 1.888.7ARMOUR (1.888.727.6687). 

What are your offer exclusions? 

Must enter code during checkout and Promotion must be selected. For use on orders shipping to US addresses only. Cannot be combined with other offers. Offer can be redeemed one time per customer. No adjustments to prior purchases will be made. Not valid on purchases made from Under Armour retail or outlet locations. Promotion code may not be redeemed for cash. Promotion code may not be cold, altered, duplicated or copied and will not be replaced if lost, stolen or corrupted. Use of Promotion Code is acceptance of its terms. Under Armour reserves the right to cancel or modify this offer at any time. Void where prohibited.
