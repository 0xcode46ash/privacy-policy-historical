# Privacy Policy , Unomatch - Get Socialized

Privacy 

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Unomatch to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions. 

Sharing Your Content and Information 

You own all of the content and information you post on Unomatch, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy. In addition:   
For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy   
When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Unomatch, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).   
We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Unomatch, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them). 

Safety 

We do our best to keep Unomatch safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:   
You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Unomatch.   
You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Unomatch, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.   
You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Unomatch.   
You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.   
You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.

Responding to legal requests and preventing harm 

We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Unomatch Credits, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. 

Registration and Account Security 

Unomatch users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:   
You will not provide any false personal information on Unomatch, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.   
You will not create more than one personal profile.

You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.   
If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
