# Privacy Policy , Unomatch - Get Socialized

Last updated 3rd Jan 2014 8:05am GMT. 

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Unomatch to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions. 

BY USING THIS WEBSITE YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS POLICY.

Unomatch is physically located in The United States of America and operated from the United States of America. 

General Website Visitors

In general, you may visit many pages of the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit the Website and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous unless they voluntarily tell us who they are. Unomatch collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. From time to time, Unomatch may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Unomatch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for visitors and for users leaving comments. Unomatch only discloses visitor and commenter IP addresses to the extent necessary to continue operating the Website, or if required to do so by law. 

Collection of Personally-Identifying Information

If you choose to sign up to Unomatch, we will ask you to provide certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing addresses, telephone number, e-mail address, birth date, gender, occupation, or personal interests. We gather this information for the sole purpose of creating an account on our system. Whether or not you choose to provide the information we request is entirely up to you. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to access certain services, offers, and content on the Website. 

By signing up to Unomatch you expressly agree to provide this information to us and to our use of it consistent with the terms and conditions of this policy. You also agree that we may from time to time send you Email newsletters. You are free to unsubscribe from the Email mailing list at any time following the instructions contained within the Email footer.

Responding to legal requests and preventing harm

We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Unomatch Credits, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. 

Registration and Account Security

Unomatch users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
