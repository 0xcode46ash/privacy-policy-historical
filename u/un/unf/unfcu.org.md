# UNFCU - Privacy Policy

**MEMBER PRIVACY  
** Over the years UNFCU has worked hard to earn your trust, and we will continue to be vigilant in maintaining the privacy of our members. To that end, we have instituted policies and procedures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled safely and responsibly. As you will see in the statement of our privacy practices, we take this responsibility  
very seriously and are committed to providing you with the highest level of member service and confidentiality. It is our promise that UNFCU will collect only the information necessary to deliver to you quality products and services. Furthermore, we are continually assessing new technology as it becomes available to continue to best protect your privacy.

(A) What information do we collect and what may we disclose?  
UNFCU collects, uses and retains information about you only for specific business purposes. This is necessary in administering our business for you and in providing competitive products, services, and other opportunities that will satisfy your financial service needs. We collect the following “nonpublic personal information” about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, assets, and income;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, and  
third parties, such as the account balance, payment history,  
transactions; and
  * Information we receive from consumer-reporting agencies,  
such as your creditworthiness and credit history.



At times, it becomes necessary to provide to third parties nonpublic personal information about you that we collect in order to facilitate transaction processing and provide support or services for one or more of our products. Examples of these third parties would include title insurance companies, statement production vendors, collection agencies, credit card service bureaus, and cheque service providers. In addition,  
UNFCU may provide nonpublic personal information about you to specially selected third parties who offer enhanced products and services such as GlobalPhone Corporation. These third parties have been carefully chosen by UNFCU and agree to safeguard your confidential information with the same commitment to privacy as we have.

(B) What happens if my information is incorrect or incomplete?  
We have implemented procedures to help ensure that member financial information is maintained in a manner that will ensure it is accurate, current and complete. If you have reason to believe that your information is incomplete or inaccurate, we invite you to contact us so we can correct our records promptly.

(C) Who has access to my information?  
For your protection, UNFCU staff is required to verify the identity of the individual who is requesting the account information. Only you and verified joint accountholders are entitled to obtain information about your account. We thank you for cooperating with our identification procedures when you contact us. 

We limit staff access to confidential member information only to those employees with a business reason for knowing such information. UNFCU educates its staff so that they understand the importance UNFCU places on confidentiality and member privacy. In addition, we maintain security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. Member privacy is also addressed in the UNFCU Employee Handbook, and any staff who violates this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary measures. We do not reveal specific information about your accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, unless:

  1. You request or authorize it;
  2. The information is provided to help complete a transaction  
initiated by you;
  3. The information is provided to a credit bureau or similar  
information reporting agency;
  4. The disclosure is otherwise permitted or required by law.



(D) How does UNFCU protect my information from unauthorized access?  
UNFCU maintains and follows strict security standards and procedures designed to guard against unauthorized access to and disclosure of confidential member information. Whenever reasonably possible, we will use security-coding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to your personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of communications  
and transactions, and protect your confidentiality. 

(E) Are there any exceptions that I should know about?  
Under certain circumstances, your member information may be shared with our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Investment Centre. This information is shared in order to market additional products and services, and to ensure we consider your entire relationship with us when making decisions about the products and services we provide to you. Examples of such information may include information about your identity, your transaction history with UNFCU, your current financial condition, and  
information obtained from a credit report or other sources outside  
of our institution.

(F) How can I avoid having my information shared with   
nonaffiliated parties?  
If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to a nonaffiliated third party, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law).

Please be assured that UNFCU will not directly, or through the  
Investment Centre, disclose any nonpublic personal information  
about you to a nonaffiliated third party unless all of these  
conditions are fulfilled:

  1. UNFCU has provided you with an initial notice of its Privacy Policy;
  2. UNFCU has provided you an opt out notice; and
  3. UNFCU has given you an opportunity, before the information  
is disclosed, to opt out of this disclosure.



However, please be aware that your right to opt out will not apply to disclosures that are legally permitted or to disclosures we make to companies that perform services on our behalf. Situations where this type of sharing could take place could include: 

  1. When UNFCU contracts with third parties to help deliver  
our services to you, i.e. property appraisal firm, credit card  
processing;
  2. When credit bureaus or other agencies, and only when  
appropriate, ask for credit references. UNFCU will not share  
your account number, password, or Personal Identification  
Numbers (PINs) with nonaffiliated third parties for their  
purposes of marketing to you;
  3. In the instance of a sale or merger of part or all of our  
business.



When we share information with third parties, we hold all such parties to the same high standards as we do ourselves with respect to the privacy of your information. 

If you wish to opt out of nonaffiliated third product and service  
offers, please complete the Opt Out Request Form and return  
to the address indicated. 

**INTERNET PRIVACY  
**

When you visit our website at [www.unfcu.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20060923123156id_/https://www.unfcu.org/default.asp), we want you to feel secure that we are respecting your privacy. The majority of the UNFCU website is protected with 128 bit SSL encryption. This encryption protects the user’s information from being viewed by an unauthorized party.

We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website. That is why you have to enter a unique member number and password each time you want to access your account information. In addition, you can use the sign off button located throughout Internet Banking to securely exit your account without closing your browser. Your password should never be shared with anyone.

(A) General Website Pages  
When you browse through the UNFCU website and have not registered for any online service from UNFCU, you browse anonymously. Personal information—such as your name, address, phone number or email address—is not collected as you browse.

UNFCU does, however, collect and store information, or “cookies,” on the domain you use to access our website. This includes the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our site, and the date and time of your visit to our website. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various pages on the UNFCU website. This information helps us make improvements to the site and better serve our members through special marketing programs.

(B) Restricted Account Access Website Pages  
Personal identifying information is collected when a member registers to access his/her UNFCU account(s) via the Internet. This information enables UNFCU to regulate entry to the restricted portions of its website and to measure member usage. Any personal identifying information gathered during member registrations is not shared with third parties.

(C) Third Parties  
UNFCU will make full disclosure online when information is being collected for transference to, or usage by other parties. Please note that by accessing a link that appears on the UNFCU website, which redirects you to a website hosted by another party, you will no longer be subject to, or under the protection of the privacy and security policies of our website.  
We encourage you to read and evaluate the privacy and security policies on the site you are entering, which may be different than ours.

(D) Personal Information  
Personal information contained in email sent by members and non-members may be used by UNFCU staff and volunteers to answer questions, to follow up on suggestions or complaints, or to improve the level of service UNFCU provides. We may use information you have given us to provide a service, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various services, and inform you about products and  
services. 

When we send emails to you, we may be able to identify information about your email address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich html emails. If your email address is html enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich html emails.

Please note that we do not provide your email address to third parties. However, we may send you offers on behalf of a third party. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from a third party and become their customer, they may independently want to send offers to you. In this case, you will need to inform them directly if you do not want to receive future offers from them.

****(E) Warning Concerning Emails  
Please be advised that email messages sent to us from outside of our specified web forms may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, if you wish to communicate sensitive or personal information, you may want to send it by postal mail.

(F) Opt Out Email Policy  
Any member who does not wish to receive email promotions or notices can reply to any email sent and ask to be removed from the UNFCU email list.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and confidential member information. If you are concerned about your financial privacy and want to know more about this important subject, or if you have a question regarding this Privacy Policy, please call us at **+1 212-338-8100** or send an email to [email@unfcu.com](mailto:email@unfcu.com).
