# Privacy Policy

We take the privacy of our visitors pretty damn seriously. We hate it when companies sell or distribute our personal information, and we know you do too. While we do use Google Analytics to collect aggregate information on unique visits and page-views, we only use this information for traffic pattern analysis. It basically helps us make our site more awesome. If you notice our website sending you a cookie from Google, that’s the reason.

Visitors who send information via our [contact](http://www.unfinishedman.com/contact), [contribute](http://www.unfinishedman.com/contribute), or [advertising](http://www.unfinishedman.com/advertising) forms **will** have their emails and IP addresses recorded, because, well, that’s how email works. This also allows us to reply to you, which is pretty neat. We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, don’t hesitate to [contact us](http://www.unfinishedman.com/contact). We’ll do our very best to address your concerns in a timely fashion.
