**Understanding Your Health Information  **

Each time you visit a hospital, clinic, physician, or other health care provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this health record contains your medical history, symptoms, examination and test results, diagnosis, treatment, care plan, insurance, billing, and employment information. This health information, often referred to as your health record, serves as a basis for planning your care and treatment and is a vital means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your health care. Your health information is also used by insurance companies and other third-party payers to verify the appropriateness of billed services. 

**Our Responsibilities**

 We are required by law to:

  * Maintain the privacy of your health information. 
  * Provide you with an additional current copy of our Notice upon request. 
  * Abide by the terms of our current Notice. 



We will not use or disclose your health information without your written authorization, except as described in this Notice. Such authorization may be revoked in writing at any time except with respect to any actions we have taken in reliance on it.

Examples of Using Health Information for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations _

We will use and disclose your health information for treatment purposes

_** _.  
_For example: Information obtained by a nurse, physician or other member of your health care team will be recorded in your record and used to determine the course of treatment. Health care team members will communicate with one another personally and through the health record to coordinate care provided. We will also provide your physician or subsequent health care provider with copies of various reports that should assist him or her in treating you in the future.

**_We will use and disclose your health information for payment purposes.  
_**For example: A bill may be sent to you or a third-party payer. The information on or accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, procedures, and supplies used. We may disclose health information about you to other qualified parties for their payment purposes. For example, if you are brought in by ambulance, we may disclose your health information to the ambulance provider for its billing purposes. 

**_We will use and disclose your health information for health care operations.  
_**For example: Members of the medical staff, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and others like it. This information will then be used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness of health care we provide. In some cases, we will furnish your health information to other qualified parties for their health care operations. The ambulance company, for example, may want information regarding your condition to help them know whether they have done an effective job of stabilizing your condition.

**_Health Information Exchange_**  
We may make your protected health information available electronically through an information exchange service to other health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses that request your information.
