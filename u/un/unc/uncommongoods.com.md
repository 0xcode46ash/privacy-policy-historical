Â  |  **Privacy protection**  
UncommonGoods respects and is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy protection section communicates how, when, and why we gather information about our customers and what we do with it. 

**Why shopping at UncommonGoods is safe**  
We have taken many precautions to insure that shopping at UncommonGoods is safe and secure. We use the industry-standard SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that all credit card transactions are secure. The SSL system encrypts information that you submit to us via our Web site when you place an order. Encryption makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept information about you, your order, or your credit card information. 

**Order information**  
If you place an order through UncommonGoods, we will ask you for your e-mail address, shipping address, telephone number and credit card information. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. All archived credit card information is maintained in a secure and safe environment. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses are only used to contact you regarding your order, unless you request to receive our e-mail newsletter updates. 

**Email List**

We invite interested visitors to sign up to receive occasional e-mails about new products, featured artists, and special offers. When you sign up, we ask for your first name and e-mail address. You can also choose to let us about your product interests and how you heard about UncommonGoods. We do not allow any other companies to use our email list to market to our customers. We do not rent, sell or share our email list, except with the company that sends our emails and this company is contractually obligated not to share this information with anyone. If you decide you no longer wish to receive e-mail from us, every e-mail we send to you includes simple instructions on how to opt out of future communications. You can also review opt-out instructions below. Catalog Mailings 

We may make portions of our mailing list available to carefully screened companies. Consequently, if you sign up to receive our catalog or make a purchase with us, you may receive other catalogs whose products or services might interest you. If you would prefer not to receive a catalog from UncommonGoods, please see the opt-out instructions below. If you would prefer not to receive any information in the mail from other carefully screened companies, please send e-mail to [donotshare@uncommongoods.com](mailto:donotshare@uncommongoods.com), including your name and address.
