# Cookie policy

**Last Updated: May 2012**

This Cookie Policy applies to any websites, branded pages on third party platforms (such as Facebook or YouTube), and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms **(“Unilever Sites”)** which are operated by or on behalf of the Unilever group of companies.

By using the Unilever Sites, you are consenting to our use of cookies in accordance with this Cookie Policy. If you do not agree to our use of cookies in this way, you should set your browser settings accordingly or not use the Unilever Sites. If you disable the cookies that we use, this may impact your user experience while on the Unilever Sites.

The table below summarises the different types of cookie we use on Unilever Sites, together with their respective purpose and duration (i.e. how long each cookie will remain on your device).

### What are cookies?

Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored on your computer (or other internet enabled devices, such as a smartphone or tablet) when you visit a Unilever Site. A cookie will usually contain the name of the website from which the cookie has come from, the "lifetime" of the cookie (i.e. how long it will remain on your device), and a value, which is usually a randomly generated unique number.

### What do we use cookies for?

We use cookies to make the Unilever Sites easier to use and to better tailor the Unilever Sites and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities and experience on our Sites. We also use cookies to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how people use our Sites and to help us improve their structure and content. We cannot identify you personally from this information.

### What types of cookies do we use?

Two types of cookies may be used on the Unilever Sites - "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Unilever Site. A persistent cookie remains on your device for much longer or until you manually delete it (how long the cookie remains on your device will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific cookie and your browser settings).

Some of the pages you visit may also collect information using pixel tags (also called clear gifs) that may be shared with third parties which directly support our promotional activities and website development. For example, website usage information about visitors to Unilever Sites may be shared with our third party advertising agency to better target Internet banner advertisements on our websites. The information is not, however, personally identifiable, although it could be linked to your personal information.
