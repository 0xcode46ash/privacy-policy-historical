# Privacy Statement | New Hampshire SERVICES

The Union Leader Corporation is the sole owner of the information collected on UnionLeader.com and NewHampshire.com

UnionLeader.com collects information from users at several different points on our Web site. For example, we request information from users at the time of any registration and on order forms, such as subscriptions, wherein a user provides contact information (such as name, e-mail address, phone number). This is used to process an order and help us contact the user as required to fulfill the order. The Union Leader does not provide any of this information to outside parties.

Purchase of archive article(s) requires an account and a credit card transaction with NewsBank Inc., and is subject to terms and conditions of NewsBank. Purchase of the electronic edition at NewsStand is subject to its terms and conditions.

#### Registration

You may be asked to register as a user to read and comment on [UnionLeader.com](http://www.unionleader.com/)articles. Registration is free and will ask you for some basic information. You may choose to receive e-mail messages alerting you when the Web site is updated with breaking news. You can opt out of this service at any time by sending a message to the [webmaster](https://web.archive.org/forms/webmaster.aspx).

The registration process may collect basic demographic information (age, town, ZIP code, phone number and whether you read the print edition). This helps us provide useful content and services and it gives our advertisers, who make this site possible, a better understanding of who they reach by advertising on UnionLeader.com. The Union Leader Corporation does not share e-mail addresses with outside parties. 

#### Cookies

Registration results in a cookie being stored on the user's computer. A cookie is a small data file that is used solely to identify you as a repeat visitor so you are not asked to register again. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

Your Web browser must have cookies enabled to view articles on this Web site or to view Union Leader archives at NewsBank. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of Web sites you visit. If you delete cookies from your Web browser, you will need to re-submit the registration form to read articles on the site.

Some of our business partners (advertisers, news/information providers) use cookies if you click to their site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

#### Log files

Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

#### Sharing

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Union Leader Corporation and relating to our Web site.

#### Aggregate information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregate information with our partners and advertisers. For example, visitor traffic is logged so we can count user sessions, identify our customer base and make improvements to meet user preferences. Gender and ZIP code information may be collected at the time of site registration to help us better serve our readers and advertisers. Also, clicks from an advertiser's banner or tile to that advertiser's Web site are logged and reported to the advertiser. No personally identifiable information is collected in these operations.

#### Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the Union Leader Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

#### Notification of changes

If we change our privacy or registration policy on this Web site that further affects information we gather, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

#### Contact information

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact the webmaster](https://web.archive.org/section/services0302).
