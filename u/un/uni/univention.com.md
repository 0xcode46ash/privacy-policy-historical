### 2\. Cookies

We use so-called session cookies. Session cookies are small units of information, which we save on the main memory of your computer.

These cookies cannot save any other data. The session cookies are deleted as soon as you finish your session.  
Cookies can normally be controlled using any internet browser. Most browsers are set up so that all cookies are accepted without asking the user. If you want to disable the use of cookies, your browser has the option of preventing the acceptance and storage of new cookies. You can find out how this works on your browser using the browser help function. If you automatically and indiscriminately reject cookies with these browser settings, you will be unable to use certain functions on our website. If you automatically delete the saved cookies after every session, the functions which require cookies are then no longer available. If you want to use all the functions of our website, you should ensure your browser settings accept session cookies.
