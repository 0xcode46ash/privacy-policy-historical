**United Rentals  
Privacy Policy and Terms of Use**

Protecting your information online is of the utmost importance to United Rentals. This Privacy Policy explains how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us through www.unitedrentals.com (also known as www.ur.com). 

**Protection of Information**  
When you visit our website, place an order online or email a communication, your data passes through a secure server maintained by United Rentals. The technology used in this process is designed to prevent someone other than United Rentals from viewing and downloading your information. For more information on this subject, see External Considerations below. 

You can visit our website as often as you like without registering; however, registration is required to use our E-Rental Store® online facility, and a separate registration is required to access the URdata® section of our website (available to certain existing account customers). The information you furnish at the time of registration is used by United Rentals to provide you with personalized service and/or to continually improve our website for the benefit of our customers. 

United Rentals may collect the domain names of all visitors to our website in order to measure the website's effectiveness and to determine ongoing improvements. We may also collect the e-mail addresses from emailed messages received. No registration information, domain names or email addresses will be shared with or sold to any other company or individual without prior authorization. We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our website, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you. 

When you initiate a transaction through our E-Rental Store® you may be asked for information that will allow us to properly complete your order. Additionally, United Rentals uses reputable companies to verify credit before billing, and we necessarily share certain information with outside service providers (for example, shipping information with our delivery service providers). We have legally binding agreements with many of our service providers that prohibit them from using customer information for any purpose other than what we instruct them to do with it. 

Additionally, when you visit our website, a tiny element of data called a "cookie" is automatically sent to your browser and may be stored on your hard drive so that our site recognizes you when you return. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie (rather than automatically accept all cookies); however, should you decide not to accept cookies from our website, you will limit your access to certain benefits provided by the site. 

United Rentals may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on United Rentals; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of United Rentals; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees, users of our products or services, or members of the public. 

**Ongoing Communications**  
When registering at www.unitedrentals.com you may be asked whether you would like to receive future communications about United Rentals products and services and/or our affiliates. If you authorize these communications, but later change your mind, follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of the communication or email your request to us by visiting the Contact Us section of the website. 

**External Considerations**  
Our website may include links to other Internet sites as a convenience to site visitors. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its products, services or privacy practices. Furthermore, United Rentals is not responsible for personal information voluntarily disclosed by you to third parties that you reach through links on our website. 

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, United Rentals cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to www.unitedrentals.com over the Internet. We do our best, however, to ensure the security of all information that passes through our server. 

United Rentals displays many products on www.unitedrentals.com, and offers them for rent and/or for sale. These products are reasonably represented to the best of our ability as to specifications, configuration, design and applications. However, United Rentals does not guarantee that the product representations are accurate in every detail or that each product will be available when and where needed to fulfill a specific request. 

**Children's Policy**  
The content of www.unitedrentals.com is appropriate for, but not targeted to, children under the age of thirteen. United Rentals does not market products or services to this age group. 

**Terms of Use**  
The complete content of www.unitedrentals.com is copyright protected and is made available to you for informational purposes only. United Rentals grants you permission to view, use, and print individual pages of this website for personal and non-commercial use only. 

Any information collected through this website may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which United Rentals operates. By utilizing this website you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country of residence.
