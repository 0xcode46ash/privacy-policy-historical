**What about "cookies"?**

To provide better service and a more effective web site, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive by our web page server. "Cookies" are commonly used on web sites and do not harm your system. By configuring your preferences or options in your browser, you determine if and how a "cookie" will be accepted. We use "cookies" to determine if you have previously visited our web site and for a number of administrative purposes. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through "cookies" with other personal information to determine who you are or your email address. 

**Will Bisk Education disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web site and to contact customers for marketing purposes. For example, based on the information you provide we may decide to inform you of existing Bisk Education products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. We may also use the collected information to help develop new products and services that we think customers may find helpful in the future. With the goal of bringing you greater convenience and more choices, we make portions of our customer list available to carefully screened companies that offer products and services that you also may enjoy and/or benefit from using. If you do not wish to receive such offers please let us know by emailing us at privacy@bisk.com. Please provide us with your exact name and address and we will be sure your name is removed from the data we share with our business partners. If you do not want to receive messages from Bisk Education, contact us and we will remove your name from our in-house list as well. If you prefer to learn about new offers from Bisk Education through a specific medium - for example, through the mail - simply let us know your preference by sending us an email at privacy@bisk.com.

At any time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists.

**Notice to parents**

We do not knowingly solicit information from children. Likewise, we do not knowingly market to children. We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet. 

**In summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. To help you benefit from another company's product or service, we may share information such as your name, address, email address, and/or phone number with that company. We share information only for legitimate business purposes. In each case, we carefully review the company and the products and services offered to make sure that they provide value.
