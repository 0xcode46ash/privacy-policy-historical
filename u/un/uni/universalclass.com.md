  2. [**Grant Proposal Basics**](http://universalclass.com/i/business/businesscommunications/classes/4587.htm) (Hot Class!) **3 Stars.** Grant writers are in demand! With grant writing skills, you have the option of working as an independent contractor or obtaining a full-time position with an organization. Community non-profit organizations are always on the look-out for someone who will help them find grant funding and to assume short-term grant writing projects. The goal of Grant Proposal Basics is seeing students in the community and in business gain a sense of accomplishment and usefulness in grant writing knowledge and skills. The purpose of the course is to teach students about grant writing, so that each student will become knowledgeable and learn basic skills about seeking financial assistance in the form of non-refundable grants for projects. The student will learn how to locate agencies and organizations that have funding available, how to contact them, how to read the requirements for preparing a grant proposal, and general guidelines for preparing a grant proposal. After taking this course, the student should feel like he or she can begin to prepare grant proposals for an individual project, or to be a useful resource to a non-profit organization or business as part of a grant writing proposal team. A grant proposal writer may average $22 to $30 an hour. Annual salaries range from $31,000 to $50,000. An independent contractor can average more than that, because benefits are not included in a contractor's salary. For a 2-week job, you can earn $2,000 to $3,000. But, Grants101 is not a get-rich quick scheme. It's about job satisfaction, having a sense of making a valuable contribution where needed, seeing the results of your work, receiving fair compensation, and being needed. One of the most satisfying things about grant proposal writing is seeing a project through, beginning to end. The person doing grant proposal writing begins by searching for funding, locating funding, working with a team who wants funding for a project, learning how to match the project needs with available funding, helping the team organize a grant proposal, and hopefully seeing that proposal become accepted as a grant that will help fund the project's needs. It's a wholly creative and satisfying job. Grants101 brings basic information to the student who wants to learn new skills to broaden opportunities in times of economic uncertainty, or to enhance skills in a present position. Who should enroll? Individuals who are in a variety of job positions and those who are independent workers will benefit from the course. This includes managers, technical writers, administrative support personnel with promotion potential, teachers, other professional specialists, artists, and students. A recent job search on the Internet turned up 450 jobs relating to proposal preparation across the country. One of those job opportunities could be yours. This 5-part session will provide basics to those seeking funding for worthy causes. 1) How to know what the eligibility requirements are to receive grant funding. 2) How to find governmental and private funding grant makers. 3) How to learn about the requirements for preparing a grant proposal. 4) How to justify the need for financial assistance with statistical data when writing a grant proposal. 5) Finally, what are the component parts to preparing a grant proposal?

This course reveals facts about the publishing industry that most writers don't know about. The pros and cons of all four publishing routes are compared: large publishers, small publishers, vanity presses and self-publishing. It provides sample guides that show you not only the standard submission formats for writing manuscripts, query letters, proposals and synopses, but also when each of them are used and what specific key elements editors look for and are impressed by, in those submissions. The writer is walked through each step of the publishing process, and given tools for doing so effectively. Secrets of the publishing world are exposed, revealing how writers can get into hot water with editors, agents and publishers, without even knowing it. Unspoken ethics, rules of etiquette, taboos, stereotypes and behavior publishers expected of writers, are discussed at length. Finally, the course focuses on various important aspects of the publishing contract. Royalties, advances, free book copies, rights, right of first refusal, creative input, aspects of performance and duration are addressed, as well as what they need to be aware of and alerted to in negotiating a contract. This course is aimed at writers who have a serious interest in getting published, but need to know the steps for doing so and can benefit from some savvy inside tips along the way. It does an excellent job of taking the mystery out of getting published and the industry, itself. By the time you are done with this course, you will be well-equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to pitch your project to publishers.
