**UniversalClass.com Inc. takes your privacy seriously.** Please feel free to review our Privacy Policy: 

Because we want to provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we may request information about you. However, we will not offer any information about you to any outside company or individual unless we receive your prior consent. 

**About this Privacy Policy**

  * This Privacy Policy covers UniversalClass.com’s treatment of personally identifiable information that UniversalClass collects when you are anywhere on UniversalClass.com sites, and when you use any of UniversalClass.com’s services. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies, schools, or other organizations that UniversalClass does not own or control, or to people that UniversalClass does not manage or employ. UniversalClass.com contains several links to other sites and UniversalClass.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. 



**Information We Collect and Track**

  * **General Usage Information**. UniversalClass.com collects information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit and what services members use. This data is automatically retrieved. This type of general information is not used to identify specific users, but in an aggregate form to help us analyze traffic patterns and enhance our service to better serve our users and advertisers. 
  * **UniversalClass.com Registration**. When you register at UniversalClass.com Inc., we ask for personal information from you (name, email, gender, etc.). Once you login to our services with your member ID and password (that identifies your registration data), you are not anonymous to us. Both General Usage Information and any personal details you provide to us is used to enhance and customize content, identify (and in some cases validate) you when you post content, join or teach a class, or access any of our member-privileged services. 
  * **Creating, Joining, Taking, or Using our Virtual Classroom Software**. When you create, join, take, or use our Virtual Classroom Software, you are not anonymous to us, the instructor(s) within the class, or the student(s) within the class you have enrolled or created. Personally identifiable information about you such as your UniversalClass.com member ID, your first and last name, and your email address is made available to fellow class participants within the class you have joined or created. This information is released and shared with your fellow classmates to better enhance your online education and to promote free and open inquiry, and to hold class participants personally responsible for their work within the online class. We are **not responsible** of how fellow class participants (instructors and/or students) decide to use this information about you. 



**What We Do with Collected Data**

Data collected from UniversalClass.com members (people who have filled out our registration form and logged in) is used to identify the member in order to allow that member to join or create classes and to give the power to that member to delete classes he/she may have created, or remove him/herself from participating in a class. Information we gather and collect about anonymous users and members logged into our service is also used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you or relevant to your needs. Additionally, we may show advertisements to you that are relevant to your demographic information. UniversalClass.com requires revenue from advertising in order to provide you with free services.

This data is only released to the instructor, and not to other people or companies. We do not release any data to the instructor that would pose a potential security threat to our service (we do not and will not release ip addresses or "cookies"). UniversalClass.com considers the instructor the owner of the content and activity within the Virtual Classroom, and as a service to the instructor and to better promote online education, we provide logs of class activity to the instructor of the class to help him/her better improve his/her intellectual environment, to better understand traffic flow, and to determine the level of class participation by individuals students. While UniversalClass does not sell or give its member list to other persons or companies, it is important to note that (if you choose to use our Virtual Classroom software) fellow class participants may obtain some identifiable information about you. 

**A Note About Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific information and to help maintain "state". A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.

If you use our service as an expert, information such as your name, your expertise, and your resume may be available to the general public. UniversalClass.com is not responsible for information you choose to make public on its web sites, and if you do not want this information to be public, select to use this service "as a student" in the "Manage Interests" area or the "Edit Profile" area.

This information is limited to your first and last name (the name you entered when you signed up on UniversalClass), email address, and your UnviersalClass member ID. As mentioned previously, any activity you do within the Virtual Classroom is made available to the instructor in table-formatted logs. This information is only released to the instructor(s) of the classroom to better help the instructor(s) determine traffic flow and individual student participation.

  1. [**Exploring the Chakra System Part I**](http://home.universalclass.com/i/crn/9763.htm) (Hot Class!) **3 Stars.** Exploring The Chakra System We will explore what the Chakra system is all about. To help you understand the Chakra system, it is useful to understand how energy works and how it affects our daily existence. There are many different cultures that have their own unique system of energy or Chakra system. The number of chakras will reflect the philosophy you adopt in terms of cultures, as well as your spiritual path. In this course we will focus on the Hindu 7 Chakra system. Our goal in this course is to learn to understand how energy impacts us as people and how we can learn to identify ways to improve our daily lives by tapping into that information within the Chakras. You will learn about what the different Chakras are, their attributes and corresponding elements. This course is divided into two sections. The first section will offer a brief introduction into the different chakras and how they impact our lives. The second section will cover the Chakra system more indepth and offer various techniques for balancing and doing healing work through the Chakra system.

  5. [**CNC Machining Center Setup and Operation**](http://home.universalclass.com/i/crn/9552.htm) (Hot Class!) **4 Stars.** This class will present the concepts related to machining center setup and operation. CNC machining centers are among the most popular metal-cutting machine tools in use today. Almost every company that manufactures any metal products has more than one - and is constantly searching for qualified people to run them. To fully master the use of a CNC machining center, a person must become proficient in three distinct skills - programming, setup, and completing production runs. This class addresses two of the three; setting up a machining center and how to complete a production run (another class is available for helping you learn CNC machining center programming). Special requirement: Note that you need to have two software viewers (Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer and Adobe Acrobat Reader) installed on your computer before you can view material presented in the lessons. Both of these viewers are freely distributed and can be downloaded from our website (www.cncci.com). From the navigation buttons on our website, click SERVICES and then click ON-LINE COURSES. The two viewers can be found at the bottom of this page.  [Mike Lynch](http://experts.universalclass.com/mlynch)
