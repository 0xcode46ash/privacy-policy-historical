**Privacy Policy**

**Personal Information**

UnitedHealth Group is very sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via the Internet. 

In general, you can visit our site without revealing any personal information about yourself. If you choose to provide UnitedHealth Group with personal information, it may be necessary in some cases for us to provide your information to our contractors or agents in order to respond to your inquiry. 

**Using E-mail**

Please know that if you send us an e-mail communication using any of the e-mail links on our site, it may be shared with a Customer Service representative, contractor, employee or agent that is most able to address your inquiry. Once we have responded to your communication, it may be discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

You should also know that unless otherwise noted, the e-mail functionality on our site does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. It is possible that your e-mail communication may be accessed or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your information private, you should not use our e-mail. Instead, you should contact us at 612-936-1300, or if you are a health plan member, contact Member Services at the telephone number listed on your benefits ID card. 

**Other Information**

When you visit our site we will collect general or "usage" information (such as the type of browser you use, the pages you visit, and your domain name). We use this information to improve the performance and content of our site to better meet your needs.

The UnitedHealth Group site contains links to other Web sites. UnitedHealth Group is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content used by other Web site owners.
