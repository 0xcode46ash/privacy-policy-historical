# University Co-op - Privacy Policy

**University Co-op Privacy Policy**

**University Co-op Privacy Policy:**  
The University Co-op cares about personal data and how information  
is used on the Internet. By using our site, you are agreeing to our policy. 

**Collecting Information** :   
The Co-op collects information in the following manner:   
Online Orders - We will need certain information including name,   
billing and shipping addresses, phone numbers and email addresses  
to complete your online order and provide the best possible service.   
Online customers may be added to our Mailing list, but you can   
unsubscribe at any time. See Mailing list below for more details.   
Online promotions - We may ask for names, email address and phone   
numbers from those who sign up for our online promotions. It is a   
convenient way to contact people to notify them they have won.   
Mailing list - To join our mailing list you will be asked to supply an   
email address. Of course, you may opt out at any time by emailing   
[weborder@universitycoop.com](mailto:weborder@universitycoop.com) or by using this [Unsubscribe link](http://www.universitycoop.com/ePOS/form=cat.html&cat=618&store=108). 

At Events - We may take photos or conduct video interviews at events  
such as tailgating parties.Â  We may ask you for your name, city, year   
of graduation and take your picture, for posting on our web site or   
other public web sites or social media sites, such as Facebook or   
YouTube. 

**Protecting Information:**  
The Co-op uses the most sophisticated technology to encrypt the   
information we transmit and store. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)   
technology to accomplish this. While the Co-op rarely links to outside   
sites, and, except for the Event photos and video interviews posted on   
third-party web sites or social media sites, NEVER shares customer   
information, please be advised that those sites will have their own   
privacy policy. 

Except for the Event photos and video interviews posted on third-party  
web sites or social media sites, or to comply with legal process, the   
Co-op will NEVER sell or disclose your identity or personal information  
to any third party.
