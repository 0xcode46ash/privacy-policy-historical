# Privacy statement

[ < back]()

The University of South Australia respects the privacy of your personal information by adhering to privacy laws. This page outlines how the University manages information collected through the use of its website. This information does not extend to external websites linked from the University website.

## Collection and use of information

One way of collecting information is through cookies, which are small information files that many websites store on your hard disk. When you log on to your UniSA [ email](http://www.unisa.edu.au/email.asp) from a particular computer for the first time, cookies containing your log on information will be saved to your hard disk. The server can then read your cookie file to confirm your identity for that site.

Cookies can only collect information that has been provided by the user, or information such as the IP address which the server already knows. UniSA will not use any electronic address captured by this means to send unsolicited commercial messages.

In the case of specific personal data, the University may only collect and use information for the purpose for which the person has expressly consented (unless otherwise required by law).

### How we use email addresses

If you have provided us with your email address for inclusion in mailing lists, we may use your email address to send you the following types of email messages:

  * Occasional updates about our products and services 
  * Email newsletters 



These email messages are sent only when the recipientâ€™s consent has been obtained. You may decline to receive email communication from us or request to unsubscribe from the email communication by emailing us using the email address provided with the above email messages. You will be asked to include the word "unsubscribe" in the subject field of the email to enable us to respond to your requests promptly.

We do not share your email address with other organisations for them to market their products or services to you. When we hire vendors to deliver emails to you on our behalf, they cannot use your email address for any other purpose.

## Website usage

The University of South Australia makes a record of your visit to our website using Deepmetrix Livestats software. We log the following information for statistical purposes - IP address, the user's top level domain name (eg .com .gov .au, etc), the date and time of the visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used. [More information about Deepmetrix products and services privacy](http://www.deepmetrix.com/legal/privacy/products/).

No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the service provider's logs.

## Personal or financial information 

A technically secure environment is in place when personal or financial information is collected to ensure that it cannot be accessed by other users or organisations. There is currently one e-commerce facility within our website: Webpay, our secure online fee payment facility for international students.

The network which hosts this facility has sophisticated security and publishing systems in place and transactions involving payment authorisation are conducted within the secure online environments of UniSA authorised banks and financial institutions to provide a greater level of security.

## Internal users of the UniSA computer environment

The University has an onus to ensure that unacceptable behaviour does not occur on the computer systems and the policy [relating to privacy on the University's IT network](http://www.unisa.edu.au/ists/Governance/Policies/pppg/protocols.asp). formalises this commitment.
