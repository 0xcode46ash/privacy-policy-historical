# Uniform Advantage Privacy Policy

Uniform Advantage values our customers. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the information you give us. We use the information you give us to process your order and make your shopping experience with us as enjoyable as possible.

Uniform Advantage does not sell, trade or rent your e-mail address to others.

What information do we collect?

When you order, we ask only for the information needed to process and ship your order. We need to know your name, e-mail address, phone number, billing and shipping address(es), credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to fill and ship your order and provide you with information on your order status. For security reasons your credit card information will not be stored under your Uniform Advantage account.

How can you update or change your information?

You can update or change your account information by accessing the [My Account](https://www.uniformadvantage.com/pages/misc/secure/login-lb.asp) link at the top of every page. The system will prompt you for your password. Your password should be a combination of letters and numbers to ensure the highest form of online security. Please keep your password in a safe, secure place and do not tell anyone your password. You can update or change your personal information after logging in.

If you had items in your shopping basket and then left our site and came back, the cookies will keep your items in the shopping basket. You can still change them or delete them.
