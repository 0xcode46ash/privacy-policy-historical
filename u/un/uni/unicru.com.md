Privacy Policy

Privacy is of utmost importance to Unicru, Inc. Below is information about Unicru's commitment to protect site users' privacy and to guard against unlawful use of personal data.

  
Last updated on: 4/9/2003

Multiple sites   
Unicru Inc. maintains multiple sites under the unicru.com domain. These include our corporate site, our Employer's Desktop site and our Job Seeker site. The use of personal information gathered at these sites varies based on the purpose for which it is gathered. The following privacy policies describe our use of data gathered from each site in detail.

I. All sites   
Privacy policies in this section apply to the sites [www.unicru.com](http://www.unicru.com/), [employer.unicru.com](http://employer.unicru.com/) and [jobseeker.unicru.com](http://jobseeker.unicru.com/).

Log Files   
Unicru logs IP addresses to track and monitor traffic patterns on the web site and to facilitate the diagnosis of potential server and/or web site problems. Information collected includes the web site from which the user is referred and pages viewed. These logs are not used to track or monitor personal information that would identify a user. 

Cookies   
Unicru utilizes cookies to provide a better user experience while logged into our site. These cookies are tied to personally identifiable information, if provided, in a securely stored database. These cookies are either removed when the user logs out or expire automatically after a specified time period. Users may set their browsers to reject the cookie; if so, certain features at the Unicru site may not be available.  
In addition, Unicru uses a tracking utility from WebSideStory called HitBox on our corporate and job seeker sites only. HitBox uses cookies to analyze user movement. Unicru uses the information to evaluate interest in the content published on our web site in an effort to improve its value to our community.

Personal information may be used in several ways: To allow us to respond to your inquiries and requests for information, including newsletter subscriptions To help us make decisions regarding what content to include on our site To customize your experience on our sites, displaying content we think might interest you based on content you view or information you provide To provide useful information to our developers for designing new features that meet registrants' needs 

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
Unicru uses a tracking utility from WebSideStory called HitBox on our corporate and job seeker sites only. HitBox employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. 

Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or site traffic analytics company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses a traffic analytics company's clear gif, the Web site (or analytics company) would match the clear gif's identifier and the analytics company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the analytics company (or Web site). To learn more about our site traffic analytics company's use of clear gifs, please go to http://www.websidestory.com/privacy. 

**Outside Links**  
These sites may contain links to other web sites. Users will be taken to a separate web site if they click on one of these links. Unicru is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of the web sites to which the user may link. All users should review the privacy policy of any web site they visit before supplying any personal information. 

Business Transitions

In the event Unicru goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Unicru will provide its collected data to law enforcement agencies if legally required to do so pursuant to law, court order or other governmental action. See "Job Seeker Site" for additional information regarding business transitions.

  
II. Corporate site ([www.unicru.com](http://www.unicru.com/))   
Privacy policies in this section apply to our corporate site, [www.unicru.com](http://www.unicru.com/). 

**Requests for Information/Subscription**   
Information requests and subscriptions submitted to Unicru via our web forms are sent to and used by appropriate Unicru staff to fulfill your particular request.   
_Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information_ If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the "Contact Us" page or by emailing our Customer Support at [info@unicru.com](mailto:info@unicru.com). 

**Text Chat Users**   
Unicru uses a text chat utility from LivePerson. This utility allows us to provide live, real-time interaction with site visitors. Use of the text chat utility is voluntary. Personal information is only collected through the text chat utility if the visitor initiates as session or accepts an invitation to participate in a text chat session. A cookie is set by LivePerson in order to maintain a chat history and preserve information you have entered in surveys for future reference. 

**What information do we collect from text chat sessions?**   
When the online customer service chat first begins, text chat users are asked to enter their names in whatever format or detail they prefer. During the chat, LivePerson Users enter into a live question and answer session with an operator. We maintain dialogue transcripts of these chats. After the chat, we ask text chat users to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about our service. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. The surveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., industry, number of employees, job title). 

Text chat users in need of technical support may be required to complete a form for purposes of defining and clarifying their technical support requests. When submitting a technical support request, text chat users are asked to provide the following identifiable information: email address, company name and store number, and a description of the issue. Emails sent to support are kept only for problem solving purposes and this information is not shared with or disclosed to any outside third parties. 

We log browser information (e.g., Internet Protocol addresses and browser types) to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our site. 

**How does Unicru use information it collects from text chat users and will Unicru disclose such information to outside parties?**   
We access the information we collect for certain purposes (for example, to aggregate the information, to monitor the use of the service during certain chats, to fulfill requests for information or technical support, and for other lawful purposes). We do not sell, trade or rent the personal information that text chat users provide. 

**HTML-based Emails**   
In addition, Unicru may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. See above for a description of clear gifs.

III. Employer's Desktop site ([employer.unicru.com](http://employer.unicru.com/))   
Employer's Desktop is a private, password-protected web-based application used by our customers to manage the hiring process. During the course of normal business processes, clients utilizing our "Employer's Desktop" product may need to enter additional information about job applicants or employees hired using Unicru's Hiring Management System. That data is stored securely in Unicru's data warehouse and is made available only to authorized personnel within the organization providing it. Applicant or employer data may be transmitted, via Employer's Desktop, to different locations or branches within the same company. This allows job applications to be available to multiple locations of the same company when appropriate. 

Applicant data may be viewed by authorized Unicru staff in order to support the application and administrative needs of job seekers and our clients. For instance, if there is a problem or error in a job application, members of Unicru's development team or customer service department may review applications to assist in resolving the issue. 

IV. Job Seeker's Site ([jobseeker.unicru.com](http://jobseeker.unicru.com/))   
Privacy policies in this section pertain to job seekers who register for an account or provide personal information through other means while visiting "[jobseeker.unicru.com](http://jobseeker.unicru.com/)." 

**Job Seeker's Privacy**  
In the course of registration with Unicru, personal information (e.g. name, address, contact information) and job preference is collected. This information is used to facilitate matching job seekers with job opportunities. Unicru will not sell or distribute personal information without the prior consent of the job seeker. 

**Use of Job Seeker Information**  
The information collected during registration is used in an automated process to match job seekers with available jobs. The personal and job preference information is sent only to employers with open job requisitions as permitted by the job seeker (see Active Status section for details on granting permission). Job Seeker information is not transferred to any outside parties other than registered employers. 

**Active Status**  
By selecting the "Send my information to employers" option at registration, the job seeker's information will be available for viewing by prospective employers. Only prospective employers with open job requisitions may preview a job seeker with active status. Prospective employers may contact the job seeker directly by telephone or email. A job seeker who has selected the "active" option may send contact information to an employer. At any time, the job seeker can return to the Unicru web site and update his or her status (See Account Updates and Corrections). Unicru will then make every effort to promptly alter that job seeker's status. 

Job seekers may decline to receive any notifications from Unicru by not entering an email address at time of registration or by deleting it from their personal information (See Account Updates and Corrections). 

**Account Updates and Corrections**  
A job seeker may update personal information and preferences at any time. To edit this information the job seeker logs in to the Unicru site, and clicks "Edit My Account" on the MyUnicru navigation bar. 

If we are going to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify the user via email. The user will have a choice as to whether or not we use the information in this way. Also, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. We may also contact users who have opted to receive communications from us via email, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

**Account Deactivation**  
If a job seeker does not log in to Unicru for a period of 90 days, his or her account will be deactivated. Job seekers with inactive accounts will not have their information distributed to prospective employers and will not receive any notifications of changes to the Unicru site and its policies. Deactivated accounts will be purged from our system after 1 year. 

**Email Notification**  
Unicru will use job seekers' and employers' email addresses to notify them of changes to the web site and its policies. Unicru may also provide prospective employers with job seekers' email addresses only for the purpose of contacting the job seeker regarding a job opportunity. A job seeker can choose not to receive these email notifications by not providing an email address during registration or by removing it from their account information (see Account Updates and Corrections).
