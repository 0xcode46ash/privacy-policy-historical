Privacy Policy

  
Employer and job seeker privacy are of utmost importance to Unicru, Inc. Below is information about Unicru's commitment to protect site users' privacy and to guard against unlawful use of personal data.

Job Seeker's Privacy   
In the course of registration with Unicru, personal information (e.g. name, address, contact information) and job preference is collected. This information is used to facilitate matching job seekers with job opportunities. Unicru will not sell or distribute personal information without the prior consent of the job seeker. 

Use of Information   
The information collected during registration is used in an automated process to match job seekers with available jobs. The personal and job preference information is sent only to employers with open job requisitions as permitted by the job seeker. (See Active Status section for details on granting permission). Job Seeker information is not transferred to any outside parties other than registered employers. 

Business Transitions   
In the event Unicru goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our Account updates and corrections section. 

Unicru may periodically use the contact information provided to notify registered job seekers of updates to the web site; and specifically of any modification to this Privacy Policy, including how information is collected and used. Unicru will provide its collected data to law enforcement agencies if legally required to do so pursuant to law, court order or other governmental action. 

Active Status   
By selecting the "Send my information to employers" option at registration, the job seeker's information will be available for viewing by prospective employers. Only prospective employers with open job requisitions may preview a job seeker with active status. Prospective employers may contact the job seeker directly by telephone or email. A job seeker who has selected the "active" option may send contact information to an employer. At any time, the job seeker can return to the Unicru web site and update his or her status (See Account Updates and Corrections). Unicru will then make every effort to promptly alter that job seeker's status. 

Job seekers may decline to receive any notifications from Unicru by not entering an email address at time of registration or by deleting it from their personal information (See Account Updates and Corrections). 

Log Files   
Unicru logs IP addresses to track and monitor traffic patterns on the web site and to facilitate the diagnosis of potential server and/or web site problems. Information collected includes the web site from which the user is referred and pages viewed. These logs are not used to track or monitor personal information that would identify a user. 

Cookies   
Unicru utilizes cookies to provide a better user experience while logged into our site. These cookies are tied to personally identifiable information through an encrypted user identification number. These cookies are either removed when the user logs out or expire automatically after a specified time period. Users may set their browsers to reject the cookie; if so, certain features at the Unicru site may not be available. 

Account Updates and Corrections   
A job seeker may update personal information and preferences at any time. To edit this information the job seeker logs in to the Unicru site, and clicks "Edit My Account" on the MyUnicru navigation bar. 

If we are going to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify the user via email. The user will have a choice as to whether or not we use the information in this way. Also, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. We may also contact users who have opted to receive communications from us via email, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

Account Deactivation   
If a job seeker does not log in to Unicru for a period of 90 days, his or her account will be deactivated. Job seekers with inactive accounts will not have their information distributed to prospective employers and will not receive any notifications of changes to the Unicru site and its policies. Deactivated accounts will be purged from our system after 1 year. 

Email Notification   
Unicru will use job seekers' and employers' email addresses to notify them of changes to the web site and its policies. Unicru may also provide prospective employers with job seekers' email addresses only for the purpose of contacting the job seeker regarding a job opportunity. A job seeker can choose not to receive these email notifications by not providing an email address during registration or by removing it from their account information (see Account Updates and Corrections). 

Security Policy   
Unicru has a security policy to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected from job seekers. Other than access of this data by prospective employers as permitted by the job seeker, data access is restricted to a limited number of authorized Unicru employees with authenticated usernames and passwords. Unicru conducts weekly internal data security and privacy reviews and has its security systems reviewed annually by an independent 3rd party. 

Secure Information Medium   
Unicru will make every commercially reasonable effort to ensure that the information medium is adequate to protect the employer's and the job seeker's information. The information medium includes facsimile transmissions to authorized locations on dedicated telephone connections and utilization of SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for browser-based communications. 

Outside Links   
This site contains links to other web sites. Users will be taken to a separate web site if they click on one of these links. Unicru is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of the web sites to which the user may link. All users should review the privacy policy of any web site they visit before supplying any personal information. 

Employer's Privacy   
Information which Unicru obtains from participating employers will not be shared with any other company, news source, or individual unless expressly permitted to do so by a responsible person in the employer's organization. Unless otherwise contractually stated, the employer owns the data associated with the job seeker's application for employment at the employer's company. Unicru will not disclose any information about the employer's job seekers to any parties that the employer has not authorized. However, Unicru may use job seeker and employer data "in aggregate" for purposes of analyzing and reporting trends, personnel research, testing new products and validation studies. "In aggregate" job seeker data will not be identified with any specific employer nor with any specific job seeker.
