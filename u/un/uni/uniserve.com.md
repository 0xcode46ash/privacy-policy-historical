** ** **Introduction**

UNIServe is an Internet Service Provider providing a full range of Internet services primarily to British Columbia and other provinces in Canada. For UNIServe, customer and employee privacy is a high priority. We have a long-standing policy of protecting the privacy of customers in all of our business operations. Federal Government Statute dictates that private sector organizations must follow a standardized code for the protection of personal information. Businesses, consumers, academics and government under the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association developed the code – _the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ ("the Act"). It lists 10 principles of fair information practices, which form ground rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. These principles give individuals control over how their personal information is handled in the private sector. UNIServe is a strong believer in the objectives and goals of the Code and this policy paper sets out how we will adhere to the principles set down in the Code.

We believe that an organization is responsible for the protection of personal information and the fair handling of it at all times, throughout the organization and in dealings with third parties. Care in collecting, using and disclosing personal information is essential to continued employee and consumer confidence and good will. 

The **10 principles** that businesses must follow are:

> 1\. Accountability   
>  2\. Identifying purposes   
>  3\. Consent   
>  4\. Limiting collection   
>  5\. Limiting use, disclosure, and retention   
>  6\. Accuracy   
>  7\. Safeguards   
>  8\. Openness   
>  9\. Customer and employee access   
>  10\. Challenging compliance

**  Scope and Application**

The ten principles, which form the basis of the UNIServe Privacy Code, are interrelated and UNIServe adheres to the ten principles as a whole. Each principle must be read in conjunction with the accompanying commentary. As permitted by the Act, the commentary in the UNIServe Privacy Code has been tailored to reflect personal information issues specific to UNIServe.

The scope and application of the UNIServe Privacy Code are as follows:

  1. The Code applies to personal information about UNIServe's customers and employees that is collected, used, or disclosed by UNIServe.
  2. The Code applies to the management of personal information in any form whether oral, electronic or written.
  3. The Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by UNIServe:


    1. A customer’s name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, when listed in a directory or available through directory assistance;
    2. An employee’s name, title, business address (including e-mail address) or business telephone or fax number; or
    3. Other information about the customer or employee that is publicly available and is specified by regulation pursuant to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.


  1. The Code does not apply to information regarding UNIServe’s corporate customers. However, such information is protected by other UNIServe policies and practices and through contractual arrangements.
  2. The application of the UNIServe Privacy Code is subject to the requirements and provisions of Part 1 of the Act, the regulations enacted thereunder, and any other applicable legislation or regulations, including any applicable regulations of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.
