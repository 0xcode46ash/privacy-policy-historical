# UniSuper - Privacy Statement

Privacy Statement

UniSuper recognises the importance of protecting your personal information. 

UniSuper is committed to the 10 National Privacy Principles (NPP) introduced by the Privacy Act 1988. 

The National Privacy Principles are standards for the way organisations handle personal information, developed by the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner. 

This policy is provided to inform you how UniSuper collects, stores, updates and releases the personal information it holds about you as a UniSuper member. 

Personal information means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) whether true or not, and whether recorded in material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion. (Section 6 Privacy Act) 

NPP 1 - Collection  
UniSuper must collect personal information in a fair and lawful manner. Wherever practicable UniSuper will collect personal information from you. It may be necessary at times to collect personal information from your employer. Any personal information collected in this manner will be advised to you as soon as practicable after the collection.  
The primary purpose for the collection of personal information by UniSuper is to provide UniSuper membership and benefits, including insured benefits, and to improve member services through research, marketing, product development and planning. 

UniSuper will provide you with access to all personal information we hold about you upon request. Your Member Benefit Statement will include most of the personal information UniSuper holds about you. 

To fulfill its primary purpose UniSuper must collect personal information required by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Act 1997. UniSuper is unable to fulfill its primary purpose obligations to you or your dependants if you fail to provide the necessary personal information. 

NPP 2 - Use & Disclosure  
The primary use of personal information by UniSuper is to provide UniSuper membership and benefits, including insured benefits, and to improve member services through research, marketing, product development and planning. 

UniSuper may also use and disclose your personal information for a purpose that has a connection to the primary purpose and is therefore considered a related or directly related purpose. 

Use or disclosure for a related or directly related purpose by UniSuper may include: 

  * Distribution of publications about UniSuper products. 
  * Monitoring, evaluating or auditing a particular product or service UniSuper is providing. 
  * Issuing reminders to members who have used a UniSuper product or service previously.

  * Dealing with complaints about a UniSuper product or service. 



UniSuper does not disclose the personal information of its members to any organisation for the purposes of direct marketing. 

UniSuper does engage the services of other organisations to assist in the provision of services to members. It will be necessary from time to time to disclose your personal information to an organisation for the primary purpose of the service they are providing. 

UniSuper will ensure that any organisation engaged is fully compliant with the Act, that your personal information is stored in a secure environment whilst they are in possession of it, that your personal information is only used for the primary purpose for which they are engaged and your personal information is de-identified upon completion of the primary purpose. 

NPP 3 - Data Quality  
UniSuper relies on accurate, complete and up-to date personal information to fulfill its primary purpose. 

Whenever UniSuper sends you information that includes your personal information we will ask you to check its accuracy and advise us immediately of any changes. 

It is in your interests to advise UniSuper of any changes to personal information that we hold, immediately. 

NPP 4 - Data Security  
UniSuper takes all necessary precautions to ensure your personal information in both physical and electronic form is secure. 

All UniSuper information technology systems employ the latest data security software and hardware. All authorised users of UniSuper information technology systems are registered with UniSuper and access is monitored on a constant basis. Users are only able to access the personal information they require to effectively perform their role. 

UniSuper operates in a secure environment that ensures protection of paper based personal information. Staff are required to respect the privacy of all personal information in their possession as part of their role.  
When UniSuper engages another organisation to assist in the provision of services to members it will ensure that your personal information is stored in a secure environment whilst they are in possession of it. Your personal information will be de-identified upon completion of the service. 

NPP 5 - Openness  
UniSuper has the following documents available on request.

UniSuper will issue documents from time to time (e.g. Member Statements) that will include the personal information we hold about you at that time. This will be disclosed in the document. 

If there is an exception to this principle UniSuper will provide reasons for denial of access. 

UniSuper relies on accurate, complete and up-to date personal information to provide a service. If you believe any of your personal information is inaccurate please advise UniSuper immediately. 

NPP 7 - Identifiers

To protect your personal information your payroll number may be used in conjunction with your member number to validate your identity. 

NPP 8 - Anonymity
