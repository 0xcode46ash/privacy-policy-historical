and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files  
and buildings. We also restrict access to nonpublic personal  
information about you to those employees and volunteers who  
need to know the information to provide products or services to  
you. Unitus never initiates requests for sensitive information by email  
(such as Social Security Numbers, passwords, or account
