# Unisys Privacy Policy

  
Your privacy is very important to us. Unisys is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. We support the Fair Information Practices defined by the U.S. government and privacy initiatives in other countries. 

Unisys reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Unisys Web site following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes. 

**Information We Collect**  
In general, you can visit Unisys on the Web without revealing any information about yourself. Within certain sections of our site, such as one of our Community portals or on our e-commerce sites, we may ask you for personal information such as your name and address. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, transact business or start a subscription, for example -- we will let you know how we'll use this information. We may also collect credit card information in order to process and fulfill orders. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. In that context, you as an individual user remain anonymous. 

We may collect and distribute aggregate statistics about our Web site visitors, traffic patterns, and related site information. These statistics do not include information that would allow the recipient to identify any individual. 

**Sending You Information**  
Our policy is to obtain your permission to send you information about Unisys or its business partners, or to share your information with our business partners. On pages on the [ www.unisys.com](https://web.archive.org/) Web site where we collect contact information, we will give you the chance to "opt out" of receiving information from Unisys and/or its business partners and to opt out of sharing your contact information with our partners. We will never make your contact or preference information available to anyone outside of Unisys or our business partners, unless required to do so pursuant to a judicial or governmental order, and even then, only to the extent so ordered. 

If you later decide you no longer want to have us contact you or to share your information, you can change your preferences on the Unisys Web site on which you have a personal profile registered or by sending an  
e-mail to [webmaster@unisys.com](mailto:webmaster@unisys.com) or call 1-800-874-8647 or  
716-742-6780. 

**How we protect your personal information**  
Data you enter during a visit to a Unisys Web site is stored on systems using the same security standards and procedures that protect our company's essential business data. Access to your data is restricted to authorized employees for Unisys business purposes and based on our employees need to know. We may transfer and store your data in other Unisys data centers located in the USA, the UK or Australia. These data centers are all under the control of Unisys Corporation, following the same security standards and procedures, unless we tell you otherwise on the form on which you entered data. Any sensitive or personal data, such as credit card or purchase order information, that you enter for online e-commerce transactions with Unisys, is transmitted in an encrypted form and requires the use of a secure browser. By using the Unisys Web site to enter into a credit card transaction, you are consenting to Unisys transferring your encrypted credit card information and the dollar amount of the transaction to external companies for credit verification. 

**Cookies**  
As you probably know, 'cookies' are small pieces of information that many Web sites store on your computer's hard drive. Some Unisys Web sites use cookies to enhance your visit, for example, by varying the images you see. On some sections of the Unisys Web we store your user name and password to make it easier for you to navigate from one secure section to another without having to re-enter your password each time, these cookies generally expire after 20 minutes. With your permission, 'cookies' will also be used to store your user name and/or password for our Community sites so that you do not have to provide them at the time of entry. We never use 'cookies' to store any type of personal information. You can set your browser preferences to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If you elect not to accept a cookie it will not affect your access to information on our sites. 

**Links to other sites**  
As a convenience to you, we sometimes provide links to other Web sites. These sites are not under the control of Unisys; and the fact that Unisys provides such links is not an indication that Unisys endorses or is liable for those sites or their content. 

We have implemented this policy for the Unisys home page, [www.unisys.com](https://web.archive.org/). If the privacy practices of any Unisys Web site around the world varies from those stated in this Privacy Policy, the data collection pages of those sites will inform visitors of such variations. 

If you have any questions or comments about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [infosecurity@unisys.com](mailto:infosecurity@unisys.com).
