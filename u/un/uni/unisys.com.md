We developed this notice to help you understand the types of personal data we collect, how we use your personal data, with whom we share your personal data and how we protect your personal data. This notice also provides other useful information regarding the data we collect and how we use cookies.

### Types of Personal Data We Collect

We may ask you to voluntarily provide personal data (e.g., name, physical and e-mail addresses, company name, telephone number, etc.) in order to request our services or use certain features of our websites.
