uniView Technologies Corporation - Internet Privacy Policy

With the tremendous expansion of the Internet and the increase in information now available, privacy and data security are major concerns. At uniView Technologies Corporation, we realize the importance of keeping your personal information confidential. We respect your need for privacy, and therefore have developed this Privacy Policy so that you may understand our commitment to protecting and safeguarding your personal information.

**Personal Information We May Collect**   
In connection with the use of some of the pages on our web site, you may be asked to provide personal information, which may include your name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, and other identifying information. It is your option to provide this information when requested on our web site. If you choose not to provide the information requested, there are some features and pages on our site that you will be unable to use; for example, those pages that enable you to contact the Company directly or fill out an online employment application. However, the majority of the web site will still be available for your viewing. 

uniView Technologies Corporation also collects IP addresses for systems administration and internal tracking purposes only. When you visit our site, our servers will automatically log the IP addresses only. uniView Technologies Corporation does not link the IP address information to any other information that would be considered to be personally identifiable. 

**Uses of Personal Information**   
The information we collect from you at our site is used for the purposes of maintaining accurate accounts and communications; providing and updating various services; and other corporate purposes in order to enable our site and services to be of maximum use to our visitors. 

Your e-mail address, if forwarded to our Company via the web site, will only be used for communications between uniView personnel and yourself. 

In all cases, we do not share any of the above personal information with other parties unless that information is necessary to provide a service that you have requested. 

uniView Technologies Corporation commits to not using or sharing personal information with other corporations, entities, etc., except as outlined in this section of the Privacy Policy, without obtaining your express permission. Should uniView intend to use this information for other unrelated uses, you will be provided the opportunity to opt-out or prohibit the use of your personal information for these unrelated uses. 

**Data Security**   
uniView Technologies Corporation strictly protects the security of your personal information, and commits to honoring your choices for its personal use. The Company has put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information you provide us online from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction. 

**Children's Privacy**   
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under age 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under age 13. We encourage parents to have discussions with their children about the safe and responsible use of the Internet, as well as the safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet. We ask that all children consult with their parents before sending any personal information to our Company online via this web site. 

**Access to Personal Information**

Should any of this information need to be changed or updated, you may send a request to [webmaster@uniView.com](mailto:zstein@uniview.net) detailing the information that needs to be changed. 

In order to protect your privacy and maintain data security, the Company will take all reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making the necessary correction.
