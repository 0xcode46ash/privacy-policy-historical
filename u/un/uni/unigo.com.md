The Web Sites are intended for users who are located in the United States of America.  This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United States. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through sources other than our Web Sites, such as by phone, through postal mail and through other live and print media, including without limitation, information obtained from or provided to us by third parties.

**You may opt in or opt out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes by following the directions in the “Right to Opt In and Opt Out” section below.**

  Advertisements and other content which may be displayed or transmitted to you on or through the Web Sites may be customized to your, interests and preferences, based on your Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information (each term as defined in greater detail below), including (but not limited to) non-personally identifying information, which we may obtain from you or from other sources.

**Purpose**  
Your privacy is important to us.  In order to make your visits to our Web Sites and use of the services available through our Web Sites as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit the Web Sites.  “ **Personal Information** ” includes, for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless and/or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; demographic information, educational and scholastic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.

**Right to Opt In and Opt Out**    
You may have the right and opportunity on the Web Sites to opt in and opt out of certain of our uses of your Personal Information.  For example, at the time you are requested to provide Personal Information on the Web Sites, we may provide you with the opportunity to elect to, or elect not to: (1) receive correspondence from us, or (2) have your Personal Information shared with other entities for their marketing purposes.  You also may be able to make these requests by adjusting your marketing preferences in your Web Site account, if such an account is available on the Web Site you are visiting.  You will also be able to opt out of Company’s promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out link within the e-mail you receive.

Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.  Also, a request to have us stop sharing your Personal Information with other entities for marketing purposes will only apply as of the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such request.  In these cases, please contact that entity directly.

**What Information is Collected on the Web Sites?**

> **User-Provided Information**

We collect Personal Information from users of our Web Sites, for example, through such users’ activities, transactions and completion of online forms on our Web Sites.  Such information may be collected, for example, when users create profiles, register or subscribe for accounts or features on our Web Sites, enter into online transactions, complete surveys, provide college reviews, respond to polls, input information into our interactive programming features such as our interactive calendar and search engine, submit content, including without limitation, media files, photos, videos, documents or other information to the Web Sites, contribute to a chat room, list serve, blog or other open forum or community feature that we may make available on our Web Sites, submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web Sites, send us an e-mail, view web pages, advertisements or file attachments, or in any other way submit Personal Information to us via our Web Sites.   

You may be able to send information about our products and services to your friends and family members through our Web Sites by clicking on an E-mail to Friend or similar button on our Web Sites or in an e-mail that we have sent you.  In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may be able to provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us.  If you have a Gmail account and have given us permission to access your Gmail address book to make suggestions about friends or family members you may want to send such messages to, you understand that Unigo may access your Gmail account address book for such purposes.  Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

  
**Web Site Usage Information**

> > **Cookies**

We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.  Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies track where you travel on our Web Sites and what you look at and purchase.  They may store your username and/or password.  A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.  Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Sites or certain areas or features of the Web Sites. 

> > **Clear GIFs**

We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Web Sites and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.  A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

> > **IP Address and Clickstream Data**

Our servers automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us.  This information is known as an IP Address, and is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider.  When you request pages from our Web Sites, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.  Our servers may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Sites; the Web site you visit after our Web Sites; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Sites or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.  We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Sites.  Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.  We may also link this information with your Personal Information.

Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

**How is Personal Information Used?**

We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Sites, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our services and features.  We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.  We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.   

In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings and the like) and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.  You may opt out of receiving such correspondence by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section.

We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. 

**Do We Share Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information With Others?**

> **Public Forums & Submitted Content**

When you contribute to a public area or similar feature of our Web Sites, such as a chat room, bulletin board, survey, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through our Web Sites, or when you contribute content to any of our Web Sites, the information that you submit may be made available to other users of the Web Sites as well as the general public.  For this reason, we recommend that you do not include any sensitive information on, or in your submissions to, these areas of our Web Sites, including, for example, your full name, home address, phone number, social security number, financial information or other information that would enable other users to locate you.

> **Third-Party Offers**

We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other entities, including, without limitation, institutions of higher education and promotional partners, who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you.  Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above, we may provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.  If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your Personal Information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above.

> **Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings**

We may offer contests, sweepstakes and other offerings (including, for example, scholarship opportunities) on our Web Sites, some of which may be operated by or co-sponsored with another company.  In those situations, unless you give your information to that other company directly, the information we may obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our sponsor and other third parties, unless you instruct us not to by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above.  In those situations, such other companies or our co-sponsors may have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies.  We are not responsible for how such other companies or our co-sponsors may use your information. In certain cases, if you do not allow us to share your information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, you may not be eligible to participate in certain contests or offerings.

> **Service Providers**

We may use third-party partners to help operate or promote our Web Sites and deliver our products and services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through the Web Sites or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, licensees of our data and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).

> **Aggregate Statistics**

We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Sites and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

> **Legally Compelled Disclosures**

We may disclose user information (which may include Personal Information) to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.  We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Web Sites, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

> **Business Transfers**

In the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. 

> **Third-Party Ad Servers**

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web Sites. These companies may use information about you and your visits to our and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  These companies also may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness.  Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or e-mail message).  We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your Web Site Usage Information or Personal Information.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer Web site at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/>.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information  **

**Security**  
We endeavor to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive Personal Information provided to us via our Web Sites.  However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. 

If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web Sites, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure.  A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

You may be able to create an account on our Web Sites with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Web Sites by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision, nor will we have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.  If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, if we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.  **You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.   If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at** [ **privacy@unigo.com**](mailto:privacy@unigo.com) **with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.**
