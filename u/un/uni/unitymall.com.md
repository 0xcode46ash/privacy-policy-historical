Our web server logs information useful as a measure of our activity. This information may include; Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform. Most IP addresses are dynamically assigned and we have no way of tying them back to our visitors.

We have created  a web site that is functional, easy to use, and most importantly, helps us support our customers at no additional cost. Other than for cashback payments, it is not our intention to maintain information on individual visitors, or information linking particular visitors to the purchases they make. All purchasing information is gathered by the retailers and not by UnityMall.com™. Our visitors leave our site once they click on a retailer’s link, and only our site ID and your chosen name’s ID is carried forward to the retailer’s web site.

Such information may include your name, address, e-mail address, and any other information you include in your correspondence. We will protect your privacy and will not provide e-mail addresses to any third party except as may be required by law. We encourage you to read our featured retailers’ privacy policies for detailed information on how they collect and use information you provide to them.
