  4. **_Social Sharing._** We may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.

Although some parts of the Services may be private, they may become public and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.
    * We may share aggregated or de-identified information obtained from you. This information cannot reasonably be used to identify you unless, of course, you have used your personal information in your profile, e.g., your username is your real name. We share this information with a wide range of clients.  Organizations such as corporations, universities, and market research firms may analyze the information for trends and insights.
    * When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, questions you have asked or participated in, moderator status, status on the Services, and other details. Some of these details you may choose to hide or display by editing your profile.
    * Please note that, even when your account is deleted, the posts, comments, participation in swarms, answers to market research questions and communications you submitted prior to deleting your account may still be visible to others, and you may not be able to delete such content after you post it. We may also retain and utilize certain information about you and your activity using our Services as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. For more information, see “Your Choices” below.
    * We will not share, sell, or give away any of our users’ birthdates, bank account information, phone numbers, real names, e-mail addresses, social security numbers or physical addresses to third parties, unless one of the following circumstances applies: 
      * We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us;
      * If you participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions, special offers, or other events or activities in connection with our Services, we may share information with entities that partner with us to provide these offerings;

      * We may share information in response to an emergency if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person;
      * We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Unanimous policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others;
      * We may share information between and among Unanimous, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership; and
      * We may share information with your consent or at your direction.


  7. **_Sponsored Rooms and Analytics Partners._** We may partner with sponsors of rooms, third-party advertisers, and analytics providers to deliver offers and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services.
