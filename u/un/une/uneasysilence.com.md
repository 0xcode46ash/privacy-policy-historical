# UNEASYsilence - Privacy Policy

### What information do you collect from me?

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information (e.g., number of users from Mexico). We use cookies to simplify the commenting process, and theme choice. You do not need to have cookies enabled to visit UNEASYsilence.

We collect NO personal information, except a users name and email address if supplied to the comment system.

This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, but we will always try to do our due diligance to ensure any links are credible.

### How do you protect my personal information?

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Logs are the most private data a website can have, the are available to only the system administrator (Dan) and are destroyed after a twenty four hour period. I would rather see our webserver be blown up then ever releasing IP addresses, and any specific user information.

### Do we share any personal information with others?

No. Never. Stats are provided to any potential advertiser in broad terms rounded up to the nearest thousand, which only include the operating system and web browser used. That information is never tied to an individual IP address, or targeted to a user.

Any questions feel free to ask us at [admin@uneasysilence.com](mailto:admin@uneasysilence.com)
