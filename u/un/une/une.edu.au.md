# Privacy - University of New England (UNE)

## Privacy

Privacy law generally relates to the protection of an individual's personal information. Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. It does not include the personal information about an individual who passed away more than 30 years ago, or the personal information contained in a publicly available publication.

When the University of New England collects, manages, corrects and protects personal information relating to staff, students and identifiable visitors to the organisation and its infrastructure, it is committed to doing so in accordance with the relevant State and Federal legislation outlined below, as well as with any other applicable laws.  The personal information you provide to UNE will be used for the purpose you provided it, to assist the University in undertaking its primary purposes (outlined within the _University of New England Act, 1993 (NSW)_ ) and any secondary purposes related to the primary purpose. UNE is not responsible for the privacy practice of web sites external to the University.

UNE will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless authorised by law. However, information may be disclosed to a third party if the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of you or another person.

University of New England staff are required under the [UNE Code of Conduct](http://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/36675/codeofconductstaff.pdf) to follow policies and to comply with appropriate legislation in relation to privacy and other matters. The University relies upon a number of key documents (below) informed by State and Federal legislation, to manage privacy matters.

##### Legislative documentation

The[ _Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012  (Cwth)_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197) (Privacy Amendment Act) was introduced to Australian Federal Parliament on 23 May 2012 as an amendment to the [_Privacy Act, 1988 (Cwth)_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712) and passed with amendments on 29 November 2012. The Privacy Amendment Act and the [Privacy Regulation 2013](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/F2013L02126)  made under the Act,  commenced on 12 March, 2014. 

The Privacy Amendment Act incorporates a suite of new principles that provide a framework for the handling of personal information in a more open and transparent manner. The new principles are called the [Australian Privacy Principles](http://www.une.edu.au/about-une/leadership/governance/une-legal-and-governance/privacy/?a=63745) (APPs). The APPs replace both the National Privacy Principles and the Information Privacy Principles. They apply to organisations and Australian Government agencies (which includes universities) and set out rights and obligations for the handling, holding and accessing of personal information (including sensitive information).

These high level changes are considered and applied when privacy matters are addressed at the University of New England, which as a university within the State of New South Wales, is also required to manage personal information in accordance with the [_Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) (PPIPA)_.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/papipa1998464) and the _[Health Records and Information Privacy Act, 2002 (NSW) (HRIP)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/hraipa2002370/)_
