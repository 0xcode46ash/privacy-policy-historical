# Privacy Policy - J.G. Wentworth

Most companies need to share personal information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons the Company can share your personal information; the reasons the Company chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.

 **

We may also share or disclose your non-public personal information (as described above) with Non-affiliated companies as described below:

**

  * As allowed by law, as necessary to effect, process, administer, service or enforce a transaction you have requested.

  * To such firms that perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, auditing, consulting, product administration and marketing.

  * To respond to a subpoena, to prevent fraud, or to comply with an inquiry by a government agency.

  * To such firms that assist us in processing, funding and completing the transaction you have requested and/or who may assist us or attempt to assist us to re-finance or sell/resell the transactions that are completed by us.

  * Health Information Practices – We will not share your health information with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent.




**How can I limit the sharing of my information?**

                  Call 1 (800) 715-8127—or E-mail us at Privacy@jgwentworth.com and provide contact information.

If we have no prior relationship with you, we can begin sharing your information 30 days from the date we send you this notice by mail. When you are no longer our customer, we will continue to share your information as described in this notice. However, you can contact us at any time to limit our sharing.

Direct marketing is email, postal mail and telephone marketing.  Your opt-out choices will last until you cancel them in writing or electronically, subject to applicable law.  Even if you limit direct marketing, we may still contact you to service your transaction or as otherwise allowed by law.

Companies owned by the Company may choose not to share personal information with Affiliates or Non-affiliates, even if that sharing is generally allowed.

**Who is providing this notice?**

This notice is provided by the Company.

**How does the Company protect my personal information from unauthorized access and use?**

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use administrative, physical, and technical security measures. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

**How does the Company collect my personal information?**

We collect your personal information, for example, when you:

  *                   Request information
  *                   Submit an application
  *                   Give us your contact information
  *                   Or otherwise provide information to us or authorize us to obtain it



**Why can’t I limit all sharing?**

Federal law gives you the right to limit only:

  *                   Sharing for Affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
  *                   Affiliates from using your information to market to you
  *                   Sharing for Non-affiliates to market to you



State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. 

**What happens when I limit information sharing relating to a transaction I completed where there was another individual (e.g. another seller) involved?**

Your choices will apply to all transactions that you have completed where there was with another customer also involved and will apply to their information as well.
