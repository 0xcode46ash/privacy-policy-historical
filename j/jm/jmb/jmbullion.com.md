# Privacy Policy and Customer Security - JM Bullion

JM Bullion respects your privacy and appreciates the enormous importance of discretion in the precious metals industry. That is why we enforce the privacy policy, listed below, to ensure our customers’ information is safe and secure at all times.

## Personally Identifiable Information

JM Bullion does not provide any third parties with any of your personally identifiable information via sale, rent, or loan. Personally identifiable information includes your name, email, phone number, address, company name, credit card details, and password. This policy is final, absolute, and will never change in the future.

## Use of Anonymous Information

As mentioned prior, all personally identifiable information like your name, address, credit card number, etc, are kept strictly private, encrypted, and secure.

However, we do collect and store anonymous browsing info such as your IP address, the pages you browsed, the time you spent on our website, the type of products you purchased, etc. This information is anonymously pooled and used to help improve our website by revealing our average visitor’s preferences and tendencies.

We may use third party applications or software to collect this anonymous data on our behalf, and those third parties may use the anonymous data themselves. Also, we may share this data with other third parties, such as advertising agencies who may deliver banner advertising to you when you visit certain websites. However, to reiterate, all of this data is anonymous and none of this data is personally identifiable.

## Opt-Out

When you create an account or make a purchase at JM Bullion, you are automatically added to our email list and will receive promotional emails including brochures, coupons, sales, and giveaways. To be removed from our promotional newsletter, log into the My Account area and uncheck the Promotional Newsletter box at the bottom of the page.

By unsubscribing from our Promotional Newsletter, you will only receive order-related emails from us in the future – i.e. order invoices, shipping notices, etc.

## Security

To ensure your personally identifiable information is always kept safe and secure, we transmit information via the highest industry standard secure server (SSL) [provided by Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/). This SSL creates the secure and encrypted https:// website address for our important pages like Checkout and the My Account area. When you see the https:// website address, you know the information you are inputting is absolutely protected and secure.

JM Bullion processes all credit card transactions securely via [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/). We never have access to your credit card information, as it is processed securely by Authorize.net following the most stringent PCI-compliant standards. This ensures in the extremely unlikely case the JM Bullion servers are compromised, the culprits could not access any of your financial details.
