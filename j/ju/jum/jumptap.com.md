# Privacy Policy | Jumptap

****Jumptap is committed to ensuring the privacy of users of mobile services.  

##   **About Jumptap**

 Jumptap is a leading independent mobile ad network. We partner with mobile website publishers and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps on behalf of our advertiser clients.  The ads we serve may be tailored to users’ interests and geographic locations. This allows our publisher and developer partners to provide advertising that is more relevant to users.

##   **Information We Collect**

 As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of Jumptap advertising, we may collect: (i) information about your device, (ii) information about your browser or app activity,  (iii) information collected by our partners and shared with us to improve the relevance of ads, and (iv) data from third party business partners. The information we collect is used for marketing purposes and enables us to more effectively match the ads served to you on websites and in apps with your interests or geographic location.  Our system does not store explicit personal data that would enable you to be identified in real life (often referred to as “Personally Identifiable Information”) – information such as a phone number, an email address, or a street address.

###  Information about your device

Information about your device may include: device type (e.g. smartphone, tablet), operating system, network provider, IP address, a carrier user ID, and a unique identifier of your mobile device. We may also use the location of your device if you have decided to provide it to a partner.

###  Information about your browser or app activity

Information about your browser activity may include: IP address, browser type, click data and types of ads viewed, cookies (small text files stored on your Internet-enabled device), web beacons, pixel tags, and sites visited. Information about your app activity may include the apps you use. __

###  Information collected on behalf of our partners

On occasion, we accept personal information on behalf of our partnering mobile publishers, app developers or advertisers, such as  when a user fills out a form enrolling for a service.  In such circumstances, we segregate this information, transmit it securely to the partner with whom the user intended to share it, and then destroy it, leaving us with no record of the personal information. Our partners collect such information in accordance with their own privacy policies and are subject to their own applicable legal requirements.

### Care with regard to sensitive data 

There is certain data that although not personally identifiable we consider sensitive, such as viewing of sites with sexual content or information indicating a users’ specific medical condition.  We do not use these types of sensitive data from one site for tailoring ads at other sites across our network.

## **How We Use the Information**

 We use the information we collect to make the ads we serve more relevant to users’ interests. We do this by matching the ads to characteristics such as the time of day, carrier network, content of the site, application or page on which the ad is displayed, the type of mobile device and web browser used, anonymous information about the browsing behavior of the user and other information including data provided by our partners.  The information we collect on our system is only used in de-identified form. So while we may select an ad for a user based on the knowledge or inference that that user is a member of a certain demographic group (e.g., a male between the ages of 25 and 34), we do not need to know, and do not know, who that user is.  We may link to our unique identifier to additional data from other partners in a way that does not identify users but that does provide us with some information about their interests (for example, that a user seems to be interested in purchasing a new car).  When we have such information, the ads that we display to that user can be more relevant to his or her interests.

##   **Information Sharing & Disclosure**

 We may share aggregate or de-identified information with our partners, subject to contractual restrictions.

 We may share information if we are required to do so to comply with an applicable law, regulation or legal process. In addition, there may be times where we will need to disclose information to protect our system or our rights or to ensure your safety or the safety of others.

 In the event Jumptap is acquired by another entity or otherwise experiences a change of control, the successor entity will have the same rights to use the data that is subject to this policy as does Jumptap.

###   **Choice**

** ** To opt out from receiving mobile Web site ads that are targeted based on your activity on the sites of our partners or third party data that we append, click the opt-out link below. This will set an opt-out cookie on your mobile browser, if that browser reliably supports cookies. If you ever delete this cookie from your mobile browser you will need to opt out again in order to restore your opt-out status. Note that opting out will not stop advertising but will cause the advertisements to be served without reference to data about your activity at the sites of our partners or appended third party data. Information that the site you are visiting provides to us may still be used to tailor an ad for you at that site. For example, if you are visiting the sports pages of a news site, we may deliver an ad that relates to the context of sports. To opt out, simply click the link below (or enter it directly into your mobile browser). Please note that to opt out successfully you must access this link from the mobile device you wish to opt out. In some cases, such as for ads served onto mobile applications, it will be necessary to provide us with your device identifier in order to opt-out because it is not technically feasible for us to opt you out without this information. Clicking the link below will provide you with instructions on how to do so. In addition, Jumptap supports the Do Not Track standard and will automatically opt you out when we detect that setting in your mobile browser. Please note that Do Not Track does not function in mobile applications and following the directions in the link below will still be required to opt out of receiving targeted advertising on mobile applications.

 If you wish to opt out, click here:  <https://opt.jumptap.com/optout/opt>

 In many cases, users are providing data directly to our partners. In those cases, the relevant privacy notices will be provided by our partners, and when partners provide us such data, we will follow their policies in addition to our own. We will ask our partners to include information about our activities whenever possible and to point users to the choices we provide.

##   **Children’s Privacy**

** ** We do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, we will immediately delete that information from our database.

##   **Processing and Storing your Data**

### ** ** **For European Union and Swiss Citizens**

** ** Jumptap complies with the U.S.-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland governed under this privacy policy. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

 In compliance with US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Jumptap at [privacy@jumptap.com](mailto:privacy@jumptap.com).

 Jumptap has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Thus, if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Jumptap, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.

###   **Data Security**

** ** Jumptap uses appropriate technical and security measures to protect the information it collects. Jumptap stores its data in a secure facility that is protected against unauthorized access and controls which of its employees has access to its data.  However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

###   **Retention**

** ** Jumptap does not deliver ads or content based on individual level data that is more than six months old.

###   **Changes**

** ** When we make material changes to this policy, we will post the new policy 30 days before it becomes effective. If we make any material changes as to the data we collect or use we (or one of our partners) will get consent from a user before using data previously collected in a manner inconsistent with the previous policy.

 If you have questions or comments about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@jumptap.com](mailto:privacy@jumptap.com).
