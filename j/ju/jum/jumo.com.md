# Privacy Policy - GlobalGiving

## GlobalGiving Privacy Policy

GlobalGiving respects your privacy. We collect information to support our relationship with you, improve our services, and communicate about promotions or special services. GlobalGiving recognizes that we must maintain and use information responsibly. 

By continuing to access or use GlobalGiving.org (‘our website’), you agree to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. These Terms and Supplementary Terms may be modified from time to time and will be posted on our website.

GlobalGiving.org is operated by GlobalGiving Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization (EIN: 30‑0108263) based in District of Columbia, United States, and GlobalGiving UK, a registered in England and Wales charity number 1122823 and registered company number 5824642, together “GlobalGiving”.

#### Information Collection

We collect information when you visit our website, create an account, edit your account information, donate to a project, or send or use a gift card. Some of this information is technical information that is automatically logged by our servers. 

You authorize us to use, store or otherwise process any personal information which relates to and identifies you, including (but not limited to) your name and address, to the extent reasonably necessary to provide the services which are available through our website by GlobalGiving, our partners, successors (including the purchaser of the whole or part of our business), associates, sub-contractors or other third parties (together our 'Associates'). Your data may be held on servers in the United States, the EEA and other countries located outside the EEA that do not have laws to protect your information. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and US and EEA data protection legislation. Further details of the companies and countries involved in processing your data will be provided on request. 

For the purposes of the UK Data Protection Act 1998, the UK data controller is GlobalGiving UK (registered company number 5824642 and registered charity number 1122823, whose registered office is at 6 Great James Street, London, WC1N 3DA, United Kingdom.) 

#### Creating a globalgiving.org Account

When you create an account on our website, we collect **basic information** about you - your name and email address. You can choose to provide additional information, such as your mailing address, a photo, favorite projects, etc., if you create a profile or create a GlobalGiving fundraiser. 

#### Making a Donation

When you make an online donation on globalgiving.org, we collect personal information such as your name, billing address, and email address, if you have not already provided these details. We collect information about your donation, including the project you are donating to and the amount of your donation. You may choose to provide the email address of friends that you ask us to notify about your use of the globalgiving.org website. We also collect (but **do not retain** ) credit card numbers which are processed by a third-party payment vendor subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. If you use PayPal or a similar service, their use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, not ours, so we encourage you to review those policies carefully. 

#### Gift Cards

When you give a GlobalGiving Gift Card, we collect payment and contact information from you, as well as the name, email address, and mailing address of your recipient. You may create a personal message to the recipient, which is stored on our servers. Except in the limited circumstances described below, we do not read or use your personal messages. 

If you are the recipient of a GlobalGiving Gift Card, we collect information from you when you redeem the Card to make a donation. Please note that we may share this information with the individual or entity who gave you the gift card. 

#### Donations in Honor/Memory of Someone

When you make a donation in honor or memory of a loved one, we collect payment and contact information about you, as well as the name, email address, and mailing address of the recipient. You may create a personal message to the recipient, which is stored on our servers. Except in the limited circumstances described below, we do not read or use your personal messages. 

#### Contests, Promotions, and Surveys

Periodically, GlobalGiving may invite you to participate in contests, take advantage of special promotions, and complete online surveys. If you have created a GlobalGiving account or profile, information we collect from these contests, promotions, and surveys may be associated with you personally. 

#### Creating a Fundraiser or Registry

When you create a fundraiser or registry on GlobalGiving, we collect information about projects you propose or wish to support. GlobalGiving notifies the project leader when a fundraiser or registry is established for their project, but does not share your personal information with the project leader or the project. Remember, however, that anything you post on your fundraiser site will be seen by visitors to the site. 

If you donate to a registry, fundraiser, or giving group, then we will also share your name and the date and amount of your donation with the person who created the registry, fundraiser, or group. 

#### Technical Information

Like most websites, our servers automatically collect certain technical information when you visit our site, including your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your visit, the referring URL, and, if you have visited our Site before, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We also collect information about your activities on the site, such as the pages you access. 

In order to collect this information, the site places a cookie on your hard drive. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

In addition, we use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, what other sites they used prior to coming to this site, and Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests). We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

GlobalGiving uses the personal information that you provide, and the technical information logged by our servers to process your donations, to: 

  * deliver the notifications described above;
  * notify your friends and family about the project if you ask us to;
  * improve your experience (such as remembering your name, the items in your Giving Cart, or your preferences);
  * contact you regarding your donation(s) and other aspects of the service; 
  * operate the site and our business; and 
  * compile aggregate statistics that allow us to understand how visitors use our site, and to make improvements in design and content to better serve you.



#### Disclosure of Personal Information

These service providers are authorized to use your information only to the extent necessary to serve these purposes, or as otherwise authorized by this policy. **Except for the purposes outlined herein, we will not trade, share, or sell a donor's personal information with anyone else.** This policy applies to donor information collected by the GlobalGiving Foundation and GlobalGiving UK through all channels, including online and offline donations.

If GlobalGiving merges with, or becomes an affiliate of another organization, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

Aside from the purposes described above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent, unless: (1) we need to respond to a subpoena, court order or legal process; (2) an emergency situation requires disclosure before your permission can be obtained (e.g., situations involving potential threats to personal safety), or; (3) we determine that disclosure is needed to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of another person. 

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our other partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

#### Information about Children Under 13

GlobalGiving.org is a general audience website, and does not collect information about a visitor's age. We do, from time to time, partner with other organizations to educate children about philanthropy in general and our work in particular. In those cases, we do not collect personal information from a visitor on pages specifically designed for children. 

#### Viewing and Updating Your Information on globalgiving.org

You can access your account information at any time by going to the My Account page. You can make changes to your information and update your account at any time. 

You can also unsubscribe from GlobalGiving communications at any time by sending an unsubscribe email as described at the bottom of every GlobalGiving communications, or by updating your subscriptions on the My Account page. 

When you create an account or profile on globalgiving.org, you can decide whether to make some or all of that information public or private. You can change your choices at any time using the My Profile page. Please note, however, that your preferences do not affect the disclosures to project leaders, or fundraisers, or giving group leaders. So, for example, if you make a donation to a fundraiser, then we will display your name and date of your donation on the fundraiser regardless of your settings. Likewise, if you contribute to a project, we will share your name and contact information with the project leader. In each case we will give you the opportunity to tell us not to disclose your personal information with the project leader, or publish it on the web site or in our annual report. 

#### Links to Other Websites

Other websites, including those of our partners (links to which appear on globalgiving.org), have their own privacy policies. When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the GlobalGiving privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

You should take additional steps to safeguard your personal information online. To learn more about how to protect yourself, visit the [Federal Trade Commission website](http://www.ftc.gov/) (US) or the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-6-rights/) (UK). 

#### Security

GlobalGiving understands the importance of keeping your information secure and confidential. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help safeguard your information. When you make a donation, information about your credit card, Paypal account, or bank is transmitted using SSL. 

#### Privacy Policy Updates

Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers.
