Credit card or bank account numbers are collected by our third-party payment vendor [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside%27,%27Zoom%27,%27width=800,height=800,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes%27\)), PayPal's use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, which you should review. GlobalGiving will collect only your GlobalGiving account information and donation history.

####  Gift Certificates 

If you give a GlobalGiving gift certificate, we collect the name, email address, and mailing address of your recipient, as well as a personal message from you.

####  Contests, Promotions, and Surveys 

Sometimes GlobalGiving may invite you to participate in contests, take advantage of special promotions, and complete online surveys. The information we collect from these contests, promotions, and surveys may be associated with your individual account in order to help us improve our website and services. This information will only be shared as described in this policy, and your answers to surveys will only be used in aggregate. 

####  What are Cookies 

We collect some technical information about how you access and use our site. Cookies are small files that a website stores on your computer. We use cookies to collect information such as what type of browser you are using, the website from which you enter globalgiving.co.uk, and the pages you view as you tour our site. We use this information to improve your experience (such as remembering your name or the items in your Giving Basket) and to help us compile aggregate statistics that allow us to make improvements in design and content to better serve you. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet. Like most websites, we identify your computer by its IP address. We use this to monitor information, such as the number of visitors that visit our website.

####  Disclosure of Personal Information 

We will share your personal information with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors in order to process your donations, offer you services in connection with our website, communicate news and information about GlobalGiving, provide customer service, enhance and improve customers' donor experiences, and complete financial transactions. If you tell us you are a UK tax payer and ask us to collect Gift Aid on your donations, we may share your personal information with HM Revenue and Customs in order to process Gift Aid claims. 

These third parties are provided with your information only to the extent necessary to serve these purposes, or as otherwise authorised by this policy. 

Aside from the purposes described above, we will not disclose your personal information only in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, for insurance when we are legally obliged to do so, or we consider that an emergency situation requires disclosure before your permission can be obtained (e.g., situations involving potential threats to personal safety), or to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of another person. 

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our other partners. This will not be linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

If (with your consent) we pass on your personal details to projects or organisations that you choose to support using our website, we are not responsible for the subsequent use of your personal information by those projects or organisations. You should contact them directly if you wish to stop receiving further communications from them. As with our Associates, these projects and organisations may be located in countries outside the EEA that do not have laws to protect your information.

####  Links to Other Websites 

Other websites, including those of our partners (links to which appear on globalgiving.co.uk), have their own privacy policies. When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the GlobalGiving privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

We recommend that you take all appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information online.
