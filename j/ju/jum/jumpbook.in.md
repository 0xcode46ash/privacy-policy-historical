Don?t trust everyone. Show discretion 

Sharing information, photos or videos is fun but you never know who will find it—it might even get featured on the front page or wind up on the top of the Most Viewed!

**_My Self – Can be Viewed only by you  
My Friends – Can be Viewed by all who are part of your friends network   
Everyone – Everyone can view it_**
