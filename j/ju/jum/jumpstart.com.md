**EDUCATION.COM'S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

education.com is committed to providing the best online family entertainment and learning within a trusted and secure environment. Privacy and safety issues are important to us, and to that end we want to ensure that you and your family members have a safe and rewarding experience on our site. We have adopted an On-Line Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. This Privacy Policy details how education.com safeguards the privacy of its on-line visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by education.com off-line. Please note that when you link to other sites from an education.com site, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites. Also, this Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.

This Privacy Policy and the certification seal located on this page confirm that education.com is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this initiative and had all of our web sites reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB Privacy Online.

Whenever you visit a web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of:

  * Exactly what personal and demographic information may be collected and by what means; 
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information;
  * How this information may be used, including, with whom, if anyone, it might be shared;
  * The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personal information;
  * How you can access and, if necessary, change the personal information a company collect and maintains;
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity;
  * Whether information is collected from children under 13; and,
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints.



If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement or policies, please contact us by email at [privacy@vuinteractive.com](mailto:privacy@vuinteractive.com) or by postal mail at: Education.com Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 6080 Center Drive, Los Angeles, California 90045. You can also contact ESRB Privacy Online directly at (212) 759-0700 or by regular mail at 845 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022.

**What information is collected?**

education.com may request and collect information from you on a voluntary basis so that you can: (1) register for an education.com account; (2) fill out a survey; (3) participate in contests, chat rooms, and other community features; (4) shop or purchase online; (5) use our tell-a-friend feature; (6) receive services that require registration or subscription, such as email newsletters and tech support; and (7) contact the appropriate education.com representative to file a complaint. The requested information may include personal identifying information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and valid credit card number with expiration date. In addition, education.com may collect demographic information such as age or date of birth, gender and hobbies. For some activities, we may ask you to create a Smart ID and password. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you, but refusal to do so may limit the services we can offer you.

**How do we use your personal information?**

The personal information you provide education.com will allow us to: (1) process orders; (2) notify contest winners and fulfill prizes; (3) solicit editorials and feedback; (4) monitor and verify education.com's compliance with stated privacy policies as well as with federal, state and local laws; (5) monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of our site; and, (6) use the information for marketing and promotional purposes. We may use your personal information to send you service related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in pricing, changes to our online service or customer support policies, or other related changes. We will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill these business objectives.

We may also enhance or merge your personal information with data from third parties. Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.

**Third Parties**

The personal identifying information you provide us is collected by and shared among the education.com sites and Knowledge Adventure, Inc., and is not disclosed to any other third parties without your permission. If education.com wishes to disclose your personal information to other third parties, we will ask for your consent at the time you register. If you provide your consent, we may share your personal information with third-party companies offering a product or service that we think would be of value to you. We will attempt to ensure that these third parties agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

education.com may disclose your personal information without consent, however, if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) education.com's rights or property, other education.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. education.com may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of education.com and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell education.com to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with education.com with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to education.com's successor or assign.

education.com may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. If, for example, you place an order at the education.com On-line Store, which is operated by Digital River Inc., the personal information you provide (name, email address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date) is collected by Digital River Inc. Although Digital River Inc., not education.com, collects the personal information you provide when you order from the education.com On-line Store, education.com still requires that Digital River Inc. adhere to education.com's Privacy Policy. This means that Digital River Inc. will never share your personal information with or sell your personal information to any third parties. 

In addition, education.com shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may say education.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize education.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.

**Links**

Users should also be aware that when you are on education.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from education.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on an advertisement or an education.com search result, the "click" may take you off the education.com site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use education.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send you their own cookies, and collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other sites.

**What about cookies, IP addresses, and other tracking tools?**

  * _Cookies_

education.com uses cookies on its web site. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences and browsing patterns while you're at our site. Cookies are necessary for some parts of the education.com service to function properly. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games. We may link information gather via cookies with your personal information.

  *  _IP Addresses_

education.com also keeps track of Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by web servers whenever you're surfing the Internet. education.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site.

  *  _Clear or Invisible Graphics_

Occasionally, education.com will make use of invisible tracking graphics (or "web beacons") to monitor the effectiveness of education.com's partner programs. These invisible graphics are used to help us count the number of visitors who came from our partner websites. Education.com does not gather any personal information about visitors by the use of these graphics.

  *  _Log Files_

The only other information passively collected by education.com is in the form of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These entries are generated anonymously, and enable education.com to assess overall website activity, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.




**Opt-Out**

To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, you may opt-out from: (1) having your personal information shared with our partners; (2) receiving communications from education.com about new features or services; (3) receiving communications from third-party companies offering a product or service that we think would be of value to you; and/or, (4) any marketing or promotional use of your personal information. To stop any of the uses above, simply send an email to [privacy@vuinteractive.com](mailto:privacy@vuinteractive.com) or modify your member information online by visiting the Member profile/preferences section at education.com.

**What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information?**

To access, review, correct or delete the personal information already collected about you; or, to remove or modify the services provided to you by education.com, please visit the Member profile/preferences section of our site or contact us at [privacy@vuinteractive.com](mailto:privacy@vuinteractive.com), and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate.

**Safeguarding your Personal Information**

To protect your personal information, we maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you provide us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your personal information from your PC to our servers. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. 

**CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD**

We do not knowingly collect personal information such as name and email address from children 12 years old and under. This category of site visitor, however, can still become a member of education.com (with a Smart ID and password) and participate in areas of education.com that do not require the collection of personal information. A parent can easily view, change and/or delete the child's username and password by following the instructions in the "What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information" section above. 

From time to time, certain portions of education.com (e.g., e-cards) may allow children under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first telling us their age or getting their parent's permission. Such portions of our sites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent.

We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.

**Internet Safety Tips:**

  * Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone else. 
  * Never give out personal information like your name, address, or phone number. 
  * Always delete unknown email attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses. 
  * Remember that nothing you write on the Internet is completely private - including email. So be careful and think about what you type in and whom you talk to. Not everyone is as nice, cute and funny as they may sound online. Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person. 



**What if I have a question or complaint?**

Any questions or complaints about education.com or this privacy policy can be resolved by contacting us via email at [privacy@vuinteractive.com](mailto:privacy@vuinteractive.com), by writing to Education.com Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 6080 Center Drive, Los Angeles, California 90045.

By using education.com, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site.
