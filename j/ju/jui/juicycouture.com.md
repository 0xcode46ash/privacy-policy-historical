# JuicyCouture | Security & Privacy

##### Introduction

The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (“Neiman Marcus”) operates, www.JuicyCouture.com, (“Web Site”) pursuant to an agreement with Juicy Couture. Both Neiman Marcus and Juicy Couture (“we” or “us”) recognize that you care how information about you is used and shared. We have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of our information collection, use and sharing practices for this Web Site. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected offline by Neiman Marcus or Juicy Couture (unless specifically stated).

##### Security

Personal information provided on the Web Site and online credit card transactions are transmitted through a secure server using Secure Socket Layering (SSL), encryption technology. When the letters “http” in the URL change to “https,” the “s” indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you're about to enter a secure area.

You may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1-888-908-1160—24 hours a day, seven days a week. One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.

We are committed to handling your personal information with high standards of information security. We take appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. Our website uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address and credit card number. Our customer service center and stores also operate over a private, secure network. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.

##### Privacy Policy

To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.

We have posted this Privacy Policy in order to explain our information collection practices and the choices you have about the way information is collected and used.

As we continue to develop our Web Site and take advantage of advances in technology to improve the services we offer, this Privacy Policy likely will change. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.

Other companies: We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.

Business Transitions: We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that Neiman Marcus or Juicy Couture or one of its properties, affiliates or subsidiaries, goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets.

##### Your Choices Regarding Use of the Information We Collect

  * write to: Juicy Couture Customer Relations at P.O. Box 650589, Dallas, Texas, 75265-0589

##### Cookies, Web Beacons, and how we use them

A “cookie” is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A “web beacon” or “pixel tag” or “clear gif” is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer to a website.

We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the Web Site as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web site you visited immediately before clicking to NeimanMarcus.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.

We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners. However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services. If you would like to opt out of these services, please [click here](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/service/optOutPopUp.jhtml).

##### Children’s Privacy

Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. Our Web Site is a general audience site. We do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We also do not send e-mail correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent’s consent. Our online sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old.

Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children’s online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.

##### Links to Other Sites

While visiting the Web Site, you may link to sites operated by our business partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse these sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any Web Site you may access through this Web site. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information or activities.

In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other sites. If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the Web Site Privacy Policy. Make sure you understand any site’s privacy policies before providing personal information.

##### Online Account Registration

To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with the Web Site. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.

If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.

##### E-Mails

You will receive promotional e-mails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive e-mail from Juicy Couture or its affiliates you can click on the unsubscribe link and hit send at the bottom of any e-mail communication sent by us. Please allow us 3 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.

##### Acceptance

By using this Web Site, you accept the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy.

##### SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY

  


##### Policy Statement & Scope

Liz Claiborne, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliated companies in the United States (collectively "Liz", "we," "us," or "our") make reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of those customers, employees and other persons who entrust us with their personal information. Liz's privacy program and data security activities are governed by a number of policies and procedures. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy sets forth how Liz handles "Personal Data", "Sensitive Personal Data" and "EU Employee Data" (as such terms are defined below, and collectively, the "Data") that is collected in and transferred from countries in the European Union ("EU") to Liz in the United States. Such Data is transferred to the United States for purposes of managing our workforce, handling customer service, product order and account management activities, marketing our products and services, and otherwise maintaining our customer relationships and advancing our business. In furtherance of those activities and such Data transfers, Liz adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles and the corresponding fifteen (15) Frequently Asked Questions developed by the United States Department of Commerce in coordination with the European Commission (the "Safe Harbor Principles"). For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles and program, please go to <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.

##### Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy and are defined here for ease of reference:

"Agent": Means a third party that processes or otherwise uses Personal Data on behalf of and under the instructions of Liz.

"EU Employee Data": Means personally identifiable human resource data about individuals who are employed or otherwise engaged by Liz or our affiliates, subsidiaries or business partners in the EU.

"Personal Data": Means any information that identifies an individual, whether collected online or offline and regardless of format. Personal Data does not include information that is aggregated, pseudonymized, encoded or rendered anonymous, or publicly available personal information that has not been combined with non-public personal information, or information that pertains to a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.

"Sensitive Personal Data": Means personal information that is not EU Employee Data and that reveals the individual's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, criminal record or that concerns the individual's own health or sex life.

##### Safe Harbor Principles

Liz has adopted the seven Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity and enforcement with respect to Data that is collected in and transferred from countries in the EU to Liz in the United States.

1\. Notice. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy informs individuals about the purposes for which we collect and use Data, how to contact us, the parties to which that information may be accessible, and the choices and means, if any, that Liz offers individuals for limiting the disclosure of such Data to non-Agent third parties.

2\. Choice. Before Liz uses Personal Data or EU Employee Data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data or EU Employee Data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or transfers Personal Data or EU Employee Data to a non-Agent third party for the purpose of allowing the non-Agent third party to exercise independent control over the Personal Data or EU Employee Data, the affected individuals will be given an opportunity to decline (opt out) having their Personal Data or EU Employee Data so used or transferred. The same choice principle shall apply to Sensitive Personal Data, but in the event that the Data is Sensitive Personal Data, the affected individual's explicit consent (opt in) will be obtained prior to such use or transfer.

3\. Onward Transfer. Liz may transfer Data to its Agents once it obtains assurances that the relevant Agents will adequately safeguard the Data that is transferred to them. Such assurances may take the form of a contract obligating the Agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, Safe Harbor certification by the Agent, or the Agent being subject to an EU data protection directive or adequacy finding. If Liz learns that an Agent is using or sharing Data in a way that is contrary to the assurances obtained, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such activity. Liz may transfer Personal Data to a non-Agent third party where such transfer is consistent with the notice and choice principles detailed above or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.

4\. Access. For those individuals who duly request it, Liz will provide such individuals with reasonable access to Data that it holds about them, except in those circumstances that are set forth in the Safe Harbor Principles, such as when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or when the rights of persons other than the Data subject’s would be violated and except in those instances where the access being requested relates to Employee Data and the person making the request is not otherwise entitled to such access under the local labor or employment laws governing such person's employment. For those individuals who receive access, Liz will take reasonable steps to permit such individuals to correct, amend or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.

5\. Security. Liz will take reasonable administrative, technical and physical precautions to protect Data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

6\. Data Integrity. Liz will take reasonable steps to ensure that Data that is stored on its servers is used, processed and maintained in a condition that is compatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized, subject to any deficiencies in the condition of the Data that existed at the time Liz received such Data.

7\. Enforcement. With respect to Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data, Liz will assure compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles by investigating and attempting to resolve complaints regarding violations of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly with the complainant, and in the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by Liz internally, the complainant may submit the matter to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) and conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant to the Rules and Procedures established by the AAA. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by the AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed by the complainant and Liz. The arbitrator (a) shall not have the power to award punitive damages against the participant or Liz; and (b) shall have no authority to resolve claims on a class or representative basis; the arbitration can decide only the complainant's and/or Liz's individual claims and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. In the event that we or such arbitrator determines that we did not comply with this Policy, we will take appropriate steps to promote future compliance. If any part of this Enforcement provision is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance of this Enforcement provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. For more information on the AAA, please visit their website at www.adr.org.

With respect to EU Employee Data, Liz will assure compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles by investigating and attempting to resolve complaints regarding violations of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly with the complainant, and in the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by Liz internally, the complainant may submit the matter to the dispute resolution program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities ("DPA's") panel. Liz will then undertake to comply with any advice that may be given by the DPA's in the matter.

##### How To Contact Us

Liz has a privacy officer ("Privacy Officer") who is responsible for Liz's compliance with and enforcement of this Policy. Liz's Privacy Officer is available to any of its customers or others who may have questions concerning this Policy. Relevant contact details are as follows:

One Claiborne Ave.  
North Bergen, NJ 07047  
Attention: Privacy Officer (Office of the General Counsel)

##### Limitation on Scope of Principles

Liz may disclose Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business. Adherence by Liz to these privacy principles may be limited to the extent required for Liz to meet its legal, governmental, national security or public interest obligations or as otherwise permitted under the Safe Harbor Principles.

##### Changes to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy

Liz may amend this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, from time to time, consistent with the Safe Harbor Principles. When we do so, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this Policy. For material changes to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, we will place a notice on the company Web site by revising the link on the home page to read "Updated Safe Harbor Privacy Policy" for sixty (60) days. Providing Data to us after such notice constitutes acceptance of such changes.
