# Privacy Statement

 

We appreciate your business … and value your privacy and security.

  The Juice Plus+ Company, is committed to safeguarding your privacy both online and off, and takes every step possible to ensure that your personal information is secure.

Privacy:

We collect personal information from you only when you choose to provide information to us, such as by purchasing our products.

Any personal information that you share with The Juice Plus+ Company will only be used by us to assist you in conducting business with us.

We will not share any of your personal information with any third party other than service partners under contract to us who help us serve you better in areas such as fraud prevention, special customer service matters, and technology services. Our contracts dictate that our service partners only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us.

In order to assure the high level of personal service for which our company is known, if you choose to become a customer and are not affiliated with a Juice Plus+ representative, we may assign you a representative and share basic contact information you provide –name, phone number, and email address – with that representative. This never includes your credit card information or other financial information.

All Juice Plus+ representatives are also contractually obligated to abide by our privacy and security policies, which include the obligation not to share your personal information with anyone else, under any circumstances.

To be completely clear about all this, we will never under any circumstances sell or rent any of your personal information to any third parties for their own marketing purposes.

We may, from time to time, send you an e-mail regarding our products and services. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, simply click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or contact us directly.

Additional Online Security:

Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us.

If you purchase our products online, your name, address, and credit card or bank account information are needed in order to fulfill your order. Any time we ask for a credit card or bank account number, we always transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format which keeps it from being understood by unauthorized people. We use state-of-the-art, industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption to ensure that is the case.

In fact, we take all possible organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, even by a company such as ours that goes to the lengths we do to ensure your privacy and security. In short, we cannot absolutely ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us – no one can – and therefore ultimately you do so at your own risk.
