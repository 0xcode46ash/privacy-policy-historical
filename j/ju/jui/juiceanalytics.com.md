# Juice Inc. Privacy Policy – Juice Analytics

_Juice Inc. operates several websites including juiceanalytics.com and concentrateme.com. It is Juice Inc.’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites._

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Juice Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Juice Inc.’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Juice Inc.’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Juice Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Juice Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Juice Inc. does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Juice Inc.’s websites choose to interact with Juice Inc. in ways that require Juice Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Juice Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at concentrateme.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Juice Inc. – by purchasing access to the concentrateme.com Paid Services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Juice Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Juice Inc.. Juice Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Juice Inc. may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Juice Inc. may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Juice Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Juice Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Juice Inc.’s behalf or to provide services available at Juice Inc.’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Juice Inc.’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Juice Inc. will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Juice Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Juice Inc. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Juice Inc., third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Juice Inc. website and have supplied your email address, Juice Inc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Juice Inc. and our products. We primarily use our development- or other blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Juice Inc. takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

Juice Inc. uses cookies to help Juice Inc. identify and track visitors, their usage of Juice Inc. website, and their website access preferences. Juice Inc. visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Juice Inc.’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Juice Inc.’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Uploaded Data

Juice Inc. will not share any uploaded data with third parties, unless specific consent is given by the user.

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Any uploaded data deleted from the concentrateme.com application will be permanently removed from Juice Inc. systems after 3 weeks, including backup copies.

### Data Security

Juice Inc. will take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

Juice Inc. encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
