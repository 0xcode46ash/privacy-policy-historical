**Our policy**  
Juno Download takes the privacy of its customers very seriously, and will only collect information in order to fulfill customer orders and (if requested by the customer) to provide information via our e-mail new release lists. We never send unsolicited e-mails to customers, and we do not sell mailing lists or customer information to any other companies or individuals. 

**Information collected**  
To process an order, we require your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit card number and expiry date. To receive our new release information e-mails, we require only your e-mail address. 

**Security**  
The shopping cart part of the site is secure, so that your order details are encrypted in your browser before they are sent to us. The order is then processed on a server that is not connected to the Internet.
