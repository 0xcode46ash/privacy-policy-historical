**Information Collection**  
Our goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide you with the product and services made available through the Justmeans, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account.

 _Registration:_  
In order to become a Justmeans user, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide: first and last name, email address, and password.

 _Profile Information:_  
Once a user, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and networking objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the Justmeans system. Personally identifiable information that we may collect may include your IP address, full user first name and last name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.

_Cookies & Log Files:_  
Like most web sites, Justmeans uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Justmeans to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Justmeans account. The next time you visit the Justmeans web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service.

When you visit the Site, our servers automatically records information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the pages you visit, the search terms you use. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information that identifies you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service. Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Justmeans web site we also automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Justmeans. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Justmeans service.

_Web Beacons:_  
We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Justmeans users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Justmeans may "target" some ads to users that fit a certain general profile – for example, "socially responsible investors in Massachusetts." 

To deliver these ads properly, Justmeans may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Justmeans so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.

**Information Use**  
Justmeans is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with each other and companies. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Justmeans from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Justmeans. This information can be utilized by Justmeans in such manner as Justmeans, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

 _Justmeans Communications:_  
We may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications sent to you.

**Information Sharing**

 _Sharing Information With Third Parties:_  
Justmeans takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, or rent, your personally identifiable information to any third parties. We will only share your personally identifiable with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform their functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.

Justmeans offers a "public profile" feature which allows users to publish portions of their Justmeans profile, including your "name", but not your "email address" to the public Internet. Users may opt-out of this feature, however Justmeans does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. analysts, executive directors), industry, geographic location, company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users' activities on the site, please email customer service.

 _Communications Between Users:_  
Many emails you initiate through Justmeans, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Justmeans website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other. Users includes company users on the site. If you select to become a "stakeholder" of a company, by clicking "Add to Network" or "Become a Stakeholder", your first name, last name, email address, current company, region, and title will become viewable by that company.

 _Legal Disclaimer:_  
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

 _Business Transfers:_  
Justmeans may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Accessing and Changing Your Account Information**  
You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your Justmeans account, at any time by logging in to your account on the Justmeans website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through the Justmeans website. If you close your Justmeans account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the Justmeans Privacy Policy that you have previously agree to. To request that we close your account and remove your information from the Justmeans service, please send your request to [techsupport@justmeans.com](mailto:techsupport@justmeans.com). Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with Justmeans under your name.

Justmeans is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We run administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access at all times.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
