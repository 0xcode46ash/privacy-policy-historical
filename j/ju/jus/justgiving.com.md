Privacy Policy

Justgiving is committed to safeguarding your privacy online and we set out below how we do this.

We use information we collect about you to help us understand more about how our site is used. Where you have given your agreement, we may also use it to communicate with you by email when we have information we think may be of interest to you.

If you choose to make a donation we will only pass contact details on to the charity you have chosen to support when you have given your express permission for us to do so.

The information we collect from you depends on how you use the site - as a visitor, a member and/or as a donor to charities. 

In this section, we often refer to ‘personally identifiable information’, which is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and postal address.

Read on to find out how information relating to you will be treated as you use our site.

  1. **The information we collect from you as a visitor**  
Justgiving collects information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. Justgiving collects this information to help administer our website and diagnose problems. We also use IP addresses to monitor site traffic patterns in order to further develop and improve the design and layout of our site. We may report IP information in aggregate to partners and charities.   
Justgiving also collects information volunteered by you, for instance in surveys.  

  2. **The information we collect from you as a member**  
When you register with us as a member, we collect your full name including your title, your email address, your postal address, your phone number (where you agree to provide it) and your password information.  
We also capture your preferences with regard to our passing on to others your personally identifiable information.  

  3. ** The information we collect from you as a donor**  
If you make an online donation, we collect additional information comprising your declaration of tax status and your credit or debit card details, including card type, card number and expiry date.   
Where you have given your agreement, Justgiving will make your personally identifiable information available to the charity or charities to which you have made donations.   
Justgiving may also use such information to contact you with information we feel will be of interest, although you can choose to opt out of this if you wish. To opt out, simply return to Your Account and amend your registration details accordingly.   
Justgiving does not pass on any information to other organisations.  

  4. **Who receives your information?**  
Justgiving collects your information and does not pass it on to third parties, except when it is necessary to process your donation and, if applicable, reclaim tax on it on behalf of your chosen charity.   
The only other exception is that we pass on your personally identifiable information to the charity to which you have made a donation if you have given your permission for us to do so.  
Please note that if you are creating your own Fundraising Page for an event or occasion, we need to pass on your name, address and email address to your chosen charity for administrative purposes.  

  5. ** Your choices regarding the use of your information **  
When you make a donation, you are asked to make two choices. You choose whether to give anonymously or to provide the charity with your personally identifiable information. You also choose whether or not to allow Justgiving to contact you in future.   
If you decide to allow us to pass your details on to the charity, please remember that Justgiving cannot control how charities use this information. Please note that for event and occasion participants only, we need to pass on your name, address and email address to your chosen charity for administrative purposes.  

  6. **Opting out of receiving information**  
When you register with us, you choose whether or not to allow us to contact you from time to time with information we feel may be of interest to you. Any messages we send you will contain instructions on how to change your preference.  
You can also change your preferences by logging in to your Account and going to the ‘Contact Preferences’ box.  
You can also choose whether or not to allow your personal details to be passed on to any charity to which you have made a donation. You can alter your instructions to us in the ‘Contact Preferences’ box in your Account. Please note that this new instruction will only apply as from that time, not retrospectively.  

  7. **How you access, update or delete your information**  
The accuracy of your individual information is important, so if any part of it changes at any time please let us know by updating your details in your Account. Just click on the ‘Personal Account Details’ tab at the top of the page and edit your registration information.  

  8. **Cancelling your membership **  
You may cancel your membership at any time by going to the ‘Cancel Membership’ box in your Account. If you choose to do this, certain information will remain in our archives, however it will only be used for aggregated statistical analysis of site use.  

  9. **Security precautions to protect your information**  
Justgiving uses the latest online security to protect the information you provide. You should be aware though that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure and any information you send us is at your own risk.  
[Read the full details of our Security arrangements](https://web.archive.org/statements/security/default.asp).  

  10. **Tell a Friend**  
We will only use the information you provide (e.g. email address) to send your message to your friend.  

  11. **Processing donations**  
In common with many e-commerce web sites, Justgiving works with a credit card company. Our chosen partner is NatWest Streamline, which securely manages all customer data in accordance with consumer data protection legislation. [See Security for further details](https://web.archive.org/statements/security/default.asp).  

  12. **Legal Process**  
Although unlikely, Justgiving may be forced by law to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate authorities.  

  13. **Acceptance of our Privacy Policy**  
Use of the Justgiving website and associated services implies acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you are not satisfied with any aspect of it please do not continue to use the website and services. This policy may change from time to time and you are deemed to have accepted the current version each time you use the site or one of our services so please check back periodically.
