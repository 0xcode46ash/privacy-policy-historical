Privacy Statement for JustListed.com  
(Last updated: December 2003)  
JustListed.com has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The privacy statement discloses our information gathering and distribution practices for this Web site (the "site"). By accessing our site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described in this privacy statement. If we decide to change or add to our privacy statement, we will post a new statement on our site and update the revision date. We encourage you to check the date of our privacy statement whenever you visit this site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.  
Information We Collect  
I. Personally Identifying Information  
Our site provides homebuyers with services related to home buying, including current home listings, neighborhood information, or other information. In order to provide these services, we collect information from prospective homebuyers and forward it to a local service provider (such as a licensed real estate agent or broker) who uses the homebuyer information to prepare a response to the service requested.  
If you are a homebuyer, we collect personally identifying information, including your name, address, phone number, email address, and information about the type of home you’re looking for and moving plans. If you are a licensed real estate agent or broker who is interested in preparing home listing information for JustListed.com, we collect your contact and professional information, including your name, company, address, phone number and email address. Regardless of whether you are a homebuyer or a real estate agent or broker, information that identifies you personally is collected from our site only if you supply it voluntarily by entering it on our site.   
II. Email Addresses  
We collect email addresses as part of providing our services. Except for customer service purposes, we will not send any emails to you unless you request information from us. Except as described in this policy, we will not disclose your email address to any third party without your consent.   
III. Aggregate Information  
We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our services. Such aggregate information includes, without limitation, site traffic, page views and impressions. This aggregate information may be connected to you for our internal use only. However, we may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, sell or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information, provided that this information does not personally identify you.  
IV. Cookies  
We currently use cookies to identify users and customize their experience on our site based on the information they give us. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on your computer by the Web server through your Web browser for record keeping purposes. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your computer (other than the contents of the cookie). It is simply an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same site's Web server in order to personalize, monitor or regulate the use of the site.   
V. Web Beacons  
A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an email message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting the site. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or email message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of the Web page to see whether the page is using a Web beacon.  
Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.  
We may use Web beacons on our site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on our site to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising or for other legitimate purposes.   
Use and Disclosure of Data  
I. Internal Use of Personal Information  
In general, we use personal information internally to serve our users and to enhance and extend our relationship with them. For example, by understanding how you use the site from your computer, we can customize and personalize your experience. More specifically, we use personal information to complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve any problems with our site, to respond to customer support inquiries, and to send you periodic email newsletters (provided you register to receive our newsletter). You should review the following section to understand when we disclose personal information to third parties.  
II. Disclosure of Personal Information  
Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not disclose, sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personal identifying information collected at our site to any other party. We disclose personal information when we have your consent to do so, as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, for marketing purposes (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications, in certain business transactions), when required by law, or when permitted to protect our rights or property. The following section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully: 

  * Your Consent. We will disclose personal information with your consent, which we may obtain in writing, verbally, through online means or as part of a separate agreement. If new services are offered in the future that require disclosure of personal information to third parties or other uses of personal information not covered in this policy, we will update this policy to reflect the changes.
  * Internal Analysis. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of these tasks.
  * Transaction Processing – Market Evaluations. We disclose personal information to third parties as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested or to perform a service on our behalf. When a third party acts solely on our behalf, we will require that party to follow our privacy practices. As stated above, your personal information is forwarded to real estate agents or brokers, and other house-related service providers in order to provide you with the services you request. We only forward your personal information to one real estate agent, broker or other service provider for each type of service you request. If the real estate agent, broker or other service provider is unable to fulfill your request in a reasonable time, we may forward your information to an alternate service provider to ensure that your request is fulfilled. In either case, that real estate agent, broker or service provider may contact you via email, telephone or other means at his or her discretion. We do not regulate how these third parties use your information and are not responsible for removing your information from any third party lists. Please contact any third party service providers directly to be removed from their contact lists.
  * Protection of JustListed.com and Others. We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of our site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
  * Business Transfers. In addition, information about our users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.

  
III. Security  
We use commercially available products to store and maintain personally identifying information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party.
