# Privacy Policy

**Toll-Free Phone Support** at 1-866-321-2287

In an effort to better serve you and the rest of our customers, we accept and store a variety of information about your activity on JustBats.com. These include:

  * The information you provide to us in order to complete an order
  * The feedback you provide to us via email
  * Which areas of the site you interact with



This section of the site will inform you of the methods we use to collect this information, the level of customer participation in providing this information, the purposes for which we use it, and what efforts we take to ensure that your information is never misused by JustBats.com or anyone else we conduct business with

#### Cookies

Visit our [Cookie Policy page](https://web.archive.org/customer-service/cookie-policy/ "Cookie Policy") for a full definition of a web browser Cookie and how they are utilized on JustBats.com.

#### Shipping and Billing Info

We require your name, shipping address, and credit card information (billing address, credit card number, and expiration date) in order to complete transactions. We use state-of-the-art encryption software with every order to guarantee that your credit card information travels over the Internet with no chance of interception. Called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, this software scrambles your information so it's virtually impossible for anyone but us to read. Once your information reaches us, our own security system keeps your data stored safely. This information is strictly confidential, and JustBats.com will never divulge such information to any third party under any circumstances except when required by law.

We also require an email address that we can send order confirmation notices and receipts to. Signing up to receive notices about special JustBats.com offers via email is completely voluntary, as delineated by the checkboxes marked "Yes, I would like to receive newsletters and promotional emails" and "Would you like to receive specials?" placed next to any form that asks for your email address. Providing your phone number within the shipping and billing information is an alternative for contacting you about orders you have placed in the event that you cannot be reached via email, but this is not a required piece of information we need to complete a transaction. Just like email addresses, we will never divulge your phone number to any third party under any circumstances except when required by law.

#### Customer Feedback

Some areas of JustBats.com, like the [Testimonials page](https://web.archive.org/testimonials/ "Testimonials"), allow users to write their own comments. We also encourage our customers to provide feedback about the website itself by contacting us at [support@justbats.com](mailto:support@justbats.com "Email us at support@justbats.com"). We use all of this information for the sole purpose of improving the experience of all JustBats.com customers, whether it be providing customers with user feedback about our products before purchasing, following up with customers who claimed to have an unsatisfactory experience, or taking advice to heart in order to improve the functionality of the website. We store emails, testimonials, product reviews, and product questions and answers within our database for these purposes. By submitting these directly through our website, you give us your consent to review and publish them on our pages for others to see, but we will never divulge this information to anyone outside of JustBats.com without your consent except when required by law. We also allow those submitting testimonials to choose their own name and location, so they can be as anonymous as they see fit.

#### User Age

We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from or do business with children under 13 years of age. By using our website you have represented and warranted that you are either 18 years of age or under the supervision of a parent or guardian. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not submit any personal information to us and ask for a parent or guardian to assist you.

#### Privacy Policies of Other Websites

The privacy policy outlined on this page pertains only to JustBats.com and may not necessarily reflect the policies of other companies whose pages you can navigate to from our site, such as our many [bat manufacturer partners](https://web.archive.org/vendors/ "Vendors").

#### Notifying Customers of Changes in the Policy

If we ever make alterations to this privacy policy, we will do our best to inform our customers of the changes. We will notify those who have signed up with us for email offers via email, and we will post a noticeable message on our home page once the changes have been implemented. Customers reserve the right to disagree with the privacy policy in any form and discontinue business with JustBats.com.

#### Contact Us

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us at 1-866-321-BATS (2287), or email us at [support@justbats.com](mailto:support@justbats.com "Email us at support@justbats.com"), and we will respond within 24 hours.
