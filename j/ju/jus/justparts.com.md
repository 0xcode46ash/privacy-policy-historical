### _Cookies:_

To serve you better, JustParts places a “cookie” on your hard drive. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your web browser from a server, and stored on your computer's hard drive during your JustParts.com visit. A cookie may contain certain information, such as a unique user session ID number, which is used to track the page(s) you visited. This information enables us to  monitor your order(s), purchase(s), and/or sale(s) on our site. Cookies also enable us to recognize registered users when they visit, and subsequently provide those customers with specific information related to their purchase(s) and/or sale(s).   
When you register with us, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our website and what you buy. Most of these cookies are “session cookies” which are automatically deleted from your computer’s hard drive once you leave our website. If you do not register, sell, or buy from the site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in order to improve your experience.  Our website logs can generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of visits to our website and pages viewed. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better service to you.  
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s configuration to prevent this from happening. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our website, but you will be unable to make any purchases with cookies disabled. Additionally, we will be unable to recognize you as a registered user on our site unless you log-in.

### _User ID Activity:_

As part of our effort to make JustParts a positive and safe buying and selling environment, your User ID (which serves as a footprint of sorts), is displayed throughout JustParts.com and in so doing, is available to the public. As a result, all of your activity on our website is traceable to your User ID. Notices will be sent to members to inform of possible suspicious and/or illegal activity, and website policy violations. A rating and commentary system attached to User IDs will also be used to provide information to other users about the reliability of those users buying and/or selling goods through our site.  These notices will refer to User IDs and items for specificity. Therefore, if you choose to associate your User ID with your name and/or business name, the people you have revealed your identity to will be able to personally identify your activities on JustParts.com. 

### _Security Information:_

Here at JustParts, you and your information are our greatest assets. As a result, your information is stored on our secure servers located in Minneapolis, MN, USA. We protect our assets with a plethora of tools including physical security, encryption, passwords etc. to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.
