Tennman Digital does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. Whenever we may need to share your personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make informed choices.

If you would like to subscribe to additional Services, you may be required to provide additional information such as your telephone number, your mobile service provider, and your address. We may use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or the Services (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest to you. Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we may permanently store any personal information provided by you via such registration process. For contests conducted on the Website, we use the personal information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you. We do not use the contact information contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other purpose, unless you have simultaneously subscribed to a mailing list or consented to such other use.

Accordingly, we will ask each contestant to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and email address. Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest as rules may vary from contest to contest. Where you provide optional information, such as information about your interests and hobbies, Tennman Digital uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable us to better understand our users, develop new products, and improve our products and services. Tennman Digital may also use this information to update you about new promotions, albums, or products, or to send you newsletters and other communications and materials relating to Tennman Digital, the Website, or the Services. This direct marketing will only come from Tennman Digital — we will not allow affiliates to do any direct marketing.
