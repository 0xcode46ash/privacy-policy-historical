# f.lux Privacy Policy

We at Flux Software LLC (“Company”) know you care about the information we may collect from you and that you may provide to us and how that information is used and shared. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Software” means the f.lux software you are about to (or have already) downloaded and/or installed. **By using the Software in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.**

Remember that your use of Company’s Software is at all times subject to the [End User License Agreement](https://web.archive.org/eula/), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [End User License Agreement](https://web.archive.org/eula/).

### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather when you are accessing or using our Software, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this information in connection with our Software, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Software and to analyze how you use the Software. In certain cases, we may also share some information with third parties, but only as described below.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to download the Software and/or send or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [justgetflux@gmail.com](mailto:justgetflux@gmail.com).

### Will Company ever change this Privacy Policy?

We’re constantly trying to improve our Software, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on [justgetflux.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140407152825id_/http://justgetflux.com/news/pages/privacy/justgetflux.com), by sending you a Webpage Notification (as described in more detail below), and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Software, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Software after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

### What Information does Company Collect?

#### Information You Provide to Us

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we may collect geolocation data (including, without limitation, city names and specific addresses you provide). We may also collect usage information such as your Software settings and preferences, and systems information (including, without limitation, make and model of your computer or device display). Certain information may be required to take advantage of some of our features.

If you request support or ask a question about the Software, we may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so (either directly or through a third party service such as Facebook, Twitter and/or an email provider). For example, we may send you emails about your use of the Software or responses to comments or questions you may have.

#### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you interact with our Software, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, systems and display information, and the type of browser and/or device on which you’re using or accessing our Software. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when features in our Software are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. We may also automatically collect information such as geo-location data based on the IP address of your device(s). When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Software, and we can use that knowledge to make the Software interesting to as many users as possible.

### How will Company use information that it Collects?

#### Webpage Notifications

From time to time, Company may send webpage notifications or messages (each, a “Webpage Notification”) to you on the device(s) on which you are using the Software as part of our automatic updates. Company may send you Webpage Notifications to highlight new features or tell you about changes to the Software. Webpage Notifications will display using your default web browser (because this is the most secure way for Company to communicate these messages to you). You may opt out of receiving Webpage Notifications by disabling Software updates.

We neither rent nor sell your information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your information with third parties as described in this section:

**Third Parties:** We may partner or work with third party services (such as Twitter, Disqus, Facebook, and email providers) to offer you certain features in connection with the Software and such third party services may collect information from our users. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party services as to privacy or anything else, so please familiarize yourself with their policies.

**Agents:** We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or Software to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

**Business Transfers:** We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

**Protection of Company and Others:** We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our End User License Agreement insert link and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.  
What if I have questions about this policy?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to [justgetflux@gmail.com](mailto:justgetflux@gmail.com), and we will try to resolve your concerns.
