# Terms of Service

**Board Guidelines:**

Our message boards are free for all registered users. You may read our boards without registering but in order to post or private message you must be registered. We would like our boards to be a safe place for people to post. We would like to avoid censorship, however, there are times when it will be necessary. Please read our guidelines for what is unacceptable. We reserve the right to remove any posts we believe are against our terms of service. 

**Signature Guidelines:  **  
Policy changes for August 2, 2005:   
Justmommies has signature guidelines restricting signatures to 600x600 pixels. The reason this is set is because of load time on our pages. Huge signatures slow down the time pages load quite dramatically. We are requesting that signatures please stay within these guidelines. 

Signature can contain any number of images, tickers, blinkies, etc. however, they must stay within 600 pixels x 600 pixels total size. 

**Business Signatures** :   
**All business links must be sponsored links.  **  

**Text Link Sponsors:** If you would like a text link of your business in your signature there is a $10.00 fee for the year. Text links will be limited to fifty words of text. To pay for your text link please go to our advertising page. [ http://www.justmommies.com/advertise2.shtml](http://www.justmommies.com/advertise.shtml)

**Image Sponsors:** If you would like to have an advertisement in your signature, there is a $20.00 fee for the year. As an Image sponsor you can include a 125x125 pixel advertisement of your site in your signature or you can incorporate your business identity into your own personal signature. If you choose the personal signature option, you must have a signature and not just an ad. Please get approval before you post your new signature. To pay for your image ad please go to our advertising page [ http://www.justmommies.com/advertise2.shtml ](http://www.justmommies.com/advertise.shtml%C2%A0)
