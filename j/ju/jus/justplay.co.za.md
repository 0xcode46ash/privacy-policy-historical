###  JustPlay Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 1 May 2009**

Digital Activators cc owns and operates JustPlay - a South African prize draw website that is governed by the Privacy Policy Statement described below as well as the JustPlay [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/) Statement. 

**Your Privacy**   
JustPlay is 100% committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to enable you to enjoy the prize draws on the website, to provide support for our product and - with your express consent - to support sponsor promotions and market research. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**   
When you register we ask for your name, email address, mobile number, prize preference categories and South African identity number. We use this information to tailor your online experience and to manage the prize draws. We email winners to let them know they have won and we ask them to show us their SA ID to ensure we are delivering the prize to the right person. 

When you complete sponsor questionnaires as part of your prize draw entry, you may choose - but are not obliged - to provide information about your lifestyle and your preferences to participate in sponsor promotions or market research. If you consent to sharing information with sponsors they may use this information to provide you with product or service related offers or they may aggregate the information for the purposes of market research. 

**Will JustPlay disclose the information it collect to third parties?**   
In order to enter a prize draw on JustPlay, you complete a questionnaire. Most questionnaires are sponsored by a third party in order to conduct a promotion or market research. By giving a positive response on the sponsor's questionnaire you give permission for JustPlay to share your information with that sponsor/client in order for the sponsor/client to contact you or send you an offer: information about products and/or services that may be of interest to you. You can accept or decline the sponsor's offer on each questionnaire. 

**How does JustPlay protect member information?**   
We use a Secure Server for collecting personal information. The secure server layer [SSL] encrypts all the information you enter before it's transmitted over the internet and sent to us. Furthermore, all of the member data we collect is protected against unauthorised access. 

**What about cookies?**   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Whenever you log in to JustPlay we store your unique ID [not your SA ID] and the time you signed in, in an encrypted session cookie on your hard drive. When you log out of JustPlay, these session cookes are expired. The functionality of JustPlay depends upon your browser accepting session cookies. 

JustPlay tracks visitors to and on the Just Play website by using referrer tracking and we use click through and open mail tracking when sending emails. 

**Your Consent**   
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of the information as described above by JustPlay. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We'll also revise the "last updated" date at the top and bottom of the Privacy Statement. 

**External Sites and Emails**   
JustPlay provides links to other sites from our website and our emails. The privacy policies of these linked sites are the responsibility of the linked site and Just Play has no control or influence over their policies. Please check the policies of each site you visit for specific information. JustPlay cannot be held liable for damage or misdoings of other sites linked or otherwise.
