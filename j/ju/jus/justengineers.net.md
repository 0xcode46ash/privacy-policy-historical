JobsGroup.net Privacy Statement

JobsGroup.net Limited has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all web sites operated by JobsGroup.net Limited.

**1) The Protection of Your CV**

We regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible to recruiters.

As an operator of a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.

The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide" means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use it when applying for individual jobs.

We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be breaching these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their use of our services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be found at the bottom of this page.

You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these instances.

_This site uses a tool which collects your requests for pages and passes elements of them to search engines to assist them in indexing this site. We control the configuration of the tool and are responsible for any information sent to the search engines_

**2) Jobs by Email Service**

The Jobs by Email service matches a job seekers requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on any one of our Sites. For job seekers who subscribe to this service you receive an email listing those jobs that we believe you should be interested in. Your requirements are defined by you using "strings" which can be used to specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of the job you want. You can change the strings at any time or unsubscribe at any time.

**3) Application Forms**

When you apply for positions with some of our Clients, you will be requested to complete an application form. The information submitted by you on the application form will be used by our Client to assess your suitability for the position to which it applies. We are not responsible for framing the questions in our Client's application forms, and merely provide the electronic means to enable our Client to present the application form to you, and to collect the application form once it has been completed by you. We do not process any of the data in completed forms, which we present to our Clients in our applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed forms.

You expressly agree, acknowledge and accept that we provide this service as a mere conduit for the applications forms. Whilst we will use our best endeavours to ensure that the application form is suitable for its purpose using suitable protection methods, please note that we do not guarantee that our protection methods will ensure that the application form does not include:

  * false, inaccurate or misleading information; 
  * material that infringes third party's Intellectual Property Rights; 
  * defamatory, libellous or otherwise unlawful information;   
  * information that violate any law, statute, regulation or order (including, without limitation, those concerning consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or the advertising prohibited goods or services); or 
  * any virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, cancelbot or other code that contains contaminating or destructive properties. 



Consequently, we cannot accept any liability for any direct or indirect damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of contracts), or any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or any other monetary or other damages or liabilities arising out of or relating to your use of the application form. In addition, we reserve the right to remove your completed application form and suspend our services in relation to it if we consider in our absolute discretion that providing the service may incur a legal liability for you, our Clients, or us. 

If you have any concerns over any application form, please contact us for advice. Our contact details are set out below.
