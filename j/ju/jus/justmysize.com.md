**Unauthorized Attempts to Get Your Information**

Criminals use various techniques to attempt to gather your personal information for use in identity theft, credit fraud and other illegal activities.

Do not provide your personal information to a third party unless you are certain of that party’s identity. Hanesbrands does not request personal information via e-mail or telephone. If you are concerned that a third party is trying to obtain your information by impersonating Hanesbrands, please contact Hanesbrands toll free 1-800-261-6098.

As we continue to develop our Site and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, we may have a need to change our current privacy policies. We therefore reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy Statement at any time. This policy is effective on and was last updated March 12, 2007. If elements of our privacy policy change, we will revise this Privacy Policy Statement.
