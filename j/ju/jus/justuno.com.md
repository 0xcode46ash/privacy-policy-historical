Privacy is important to us. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected, protected, used and disclosed by us and through our Website and the Justuno Service.

This Privacy Policy is divided into two sections: the first deals with information that we collect, both via this Website and via our customer's’ applications which utilize the Justuno Service, and the second part deals with the manner in which we use such information, together with other legal matters. In the second case, our customers are providing user information to us, but we also wanted to outline to users how we, in turn, use and share that information.

Manually-Inputted Information  
You can visit and browse the Justuno Website without providing any information about yourself. You may voluntarily provide personal information, such as contact information, or we may ask for such information in various forms on this Website, including requests for product or service information, white papers, registration for Webinars etc.

We may use your email address or other contact information you give us to contact you with product or service information. If we ask for your preferences (e.g. in relation to promotions, platforms etc), we will only use that information to tailor our communications to you. We may also use preference information on an aggregated basis (where you are not personally identifiable) for our business, research, product development and marketing purposes. Other than as outlined below, we do not make personally identifiable information available to any third party and we do not sell any personally identifiable information to third parties.

When you access the Justuno Website, some information may be automatically collected, such as your computer's or mobile device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's or mobile device’s operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit.

The Justuno Website and Service uses cookies. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer's or mobile device’s hard drive by a web server - which is acknowledged by your web browser which acts to identify your computer. Cookies are used to collect and send information about your website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website and other statistics. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Website and the Justuno Services. [Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on your computer and cannot be used to personally identify you.] You can prevent cookies being placed on your hard drive by setting your internet browser settings to not accept cookies.

Notwithstanding any other provision, we may also engage a data provider who may collect weblog data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you have submitted, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these data provider cookies, please go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.

When you use an application which uses the Justuno Service (i.e. an overlay on your website), the privacy policy that applies is the one between you and your website visitor (“Visitor”). In order to offer the Justuno Service to Visitors, we require that you obtain permission from the visitor to share certain information with us. This information may be “personal” information, such as name, address, contact details and social network user information (“Personal Data”). Information collected may also be non-personal information, such as mobile device information like operating system and hardware type, IP address, UDID/MAC address, geographic location, gender and age (“User Data”).

We do not require access to sensitive personal information, such as medical or health information; racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; sexual orientation.

We use User Data to enhance the Justuno Service and its features available to you and our developers, which includes allowing you and our developers to personalize the online experience to your preferences. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.

We use User Data in aggregate or anonymized form (such that users are not personally identifiable) for our business, research, product development and marketing purposes.

When requested, we may share our data, including personal information, with our subsidiary companies. In addition to the other purposes outlined in this policy, we may share:

  * any information or data in response to a verified request by law enforcement, immigration, customs or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity.
  * User Data with our business partners or for product development, marketing or public relations – [information shared is limited to aggregated or anonymized data.]
  * any information or data with our hosting provider who may only use the information to administer our Website and the Justuno Services. The hosting provider is required to keep all information private and secure.
  * Any information in connection with any merger, sale of Justuno’s assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another entity.



You may ask us to delete any personal information you have provided directly to us at any time. We do retain the right to use the aggregate data we have collected, provided that such data does not personally identify you.

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. Justuno uses industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of any Personal Data it owns or processes on behalf of Clients, including, in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access, and encrypted transmissions. Justuno limits access to Personal Data to those persons in Justuno’s organization who have a business need to process such Personal Data. However, no company, including Justuno, can fully eliminate the security risks associated with such Personal Data. Due to factors beyond our control, Justuno cannot ensure that Personal Data will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, Justuno may become legally obligated to disclose such data, or, despite precautions, third parties may circumvent security measures to intercept or access such data.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), We may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Justuno does not review, comment upon, or monitor its Clients’ compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does Justuno review Client instructions to determine whether they are in compliance or conflict with the terms of a Client’s published privacy policy.

Please be advised this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Justuno does not own or control, or to people that Justuno does not employ or manage. This includes links to other websites on the Site as well as any companies from whom you may have ordered services or products that are transmitted over Justuno’s network, and any companies from whom you may be purchasing telecommunications services. Justuno recommends that you be aware when you leave the Site and read the terms of use and privacy policies of any site, product or service that collects personally identifiable information.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it regularly. If We make changes to this Privacy Policy, We will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and other places We deem appropriate. All such changes shall be binding on you 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site unless you are a new user, in which case they are binding on you immediately.

If you would like to update or correct any information that you have provided to Justuno through your use of our services or this website, limit or opt-out of certain communications, revoke prior communication choices you have made, or if you have suggestions for improving this privacy policy, please send an e-mail to [help@justuno.com](mailto:help@justuno.com), or fill out the form in the Contact Us link on this website. We will use reasonable commercial efforts to address any concerns that you may have.
