# JustAnswer: Privacy & Security

The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live and work, and we're starting to see that potential today. With JustAnswer, you are only a few mouse-clicks away from responses (and inquirers) to all your questions. 

SECURITY

JustAnswer protects your data by using multiple security protection methods. These methods help ensure that your information is safer than if it were kept in your own home. Our protection protocol involves security built into the application, encryption during key transmissions, data maintenance protection, and physical barriers to our servers. 

**Security within the Application**   
All sensitive data in JustAnswer is password protected. All passwords use 160 bit encryption. 

**Data Protection Across the Internet**  
JustAnswer uses 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL) technology and digital certificates to encrypt and authenticate transactions (Credit Card and other Payments). SSL creates a secured connection between our web servers and your browser, which eliminates unauthorized access to transmitted data and ensures data is sent only to the intended recipient. 

**Database Protection**  
Our database logs important changes so that all unauthorized transactions can be quickly reversed. 

**Physical Barriers Protecting Your Information**  
Our servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider of Internet access to enterprises with mission-critical Internet application requirements. Access to the host environment is highly secure. 

PRIVACY

Inherent to transacting on the Internet is the collection of some personal information. JustAnswer realizes how important this data is to its customers and works to help them retain their privacy when they take advantage of what JustAnswer has to offer. 

We at JustAnswer want you to feel confident about using the Internet to ask and answer questions. Our aim is to build this confidence by implementing the principles of disclosure and fair information practices. We are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful, safe online experience that you can get anywhere. 

Because your privacy is important to us, JustAnswer operates by the following principles: 

**Principle 1.**  
JustAnswer explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies an individual ("Personally Identifiable Information"). To help facilitate the question and response process, JustAnswer needs to ask for basic data, including contact information (like name and email address). 

In some cases, JustAnswer supplements the information that you provide with data received from third parties. We do this for your convenience. (For example, when you give us your zip code, we sometimes use a database to retrieve the matching city and state... so you don't have to type it yourself.) 

**Principle 2.**  
JustAnswer only uses your personal information and usage statistics (IP addresses, browser types, domain names, etc.) for demographic studies, to help us service you better, tailor JustAnswer’s content to its users’ needs, and display appropriate advertisements. We keep your personal information private and do not share it with any third parties, including JustAnswer business, ‘powered by’, and co-branded partners, without your prior consent. 

JustAnswer will not disclose your personal information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
 •  conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process;   
 •  protect and defend the rights or property of JustAnswer;  
 •  enforce the JustAnswer Terms of Service; or   
 •  act to protect the interests of its members or others.  


**Principle 3.**  
JustAnswer will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, except:   
 •  New subscribers will receive an JustAnswer registration letter as well as updates about questions you are asking or answering to.   
 •  Periodically, JustAnswer will send you information about new services and your account.  
 •  Our customer service department may contact you in order to ensure your satisfaction with JustAnswer, and ask how we can make our services better.

If you do not wish to receive email regarding product updates, or be contacted for feedback, notify us by e-mailing info@justanswer.com. 

**Principle 4.**  
To enhance and individualize your experience with JustAnswer, we use a web browser feature called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your browser places on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and, if you wish, retrieve your user name and password so that you do not need to enter them again. Cookies are not used to store other personal information. 

In addition, JustAnswer uses cookies to maintain state. That is, each time you logon, our system issues your browser a unique, randomly generated number by which it can identify itself. In that way, your data gets sent to you and not someone else. You must activate cookies to logon to JustAnswer. 

**Principle 5.**  
JustAnswer allows you to customize your postings and personal content. For instance, you can add links to other Web sites you find interesting or relevant to your listing or posting. JustAnswer is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. Be sure to read the privacy statements that they maintain. 

**Principle 6.**  
If at any time you would like to be removed from our database or believe that JustAnswer has not adhered to these privacy principles, please notify us by email at info@justanswer.com. We will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly detect and remedy any problems. All JustAnswer employees and partners are educated on and enforce these privacy policies.
