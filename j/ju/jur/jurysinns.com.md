## Privacy and Security

At Jurys Inn, the privacy and protection of personal data is treated with the utmost seriousness. Our privacy statement, below, sets out the data protection practices currently in place within the company.

## Privacy statement

We fully endorse and adhere to the principles of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. Specifically, we state that we will: 

  * Obtain and process information fairly. 
  * Keep it only for one or more specified, explicit and lawful purpose. 
  * Use and disclose it only in ways compatible with these  purposes. 
  * Keep it safe and secure.

This allows your computer to communicate with our server in a way that is designed to prevent tampering or message forgery. Your credit card number is also "one-way" encrypted as it enters our databases.

We will take all reasonable care to keep the details of your order and credit card information secure but unless we have been negligent, we will not be liable for any losses you may suffer as a result of unauthorised access by a third party to the information transmitted by you when making reservations at this website.

Please be aware that all personal data and CVs or resumés submitted via jurysinns.com are stored on a secure, dedicated server for a fixed period of six months only. After this, all data is deleted. This data will only be used for the purpose intended. Access to this data is strictly limited to authorised personnel from the Jurys Inn human resources department.

## Cookie usage and storage

We do not store any personal or traceable customer information in the cookies that we use. Additionally, all our cookie data is encrypted to prevent third parties from accessing the information they contain. Each cookie we set lasts only for the duration of each visit.
