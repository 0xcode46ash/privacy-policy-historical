## JiWire Privacy Protection Statement

**Introduction**  
JiWire is a location-based media company that provides an advertising platform and revenue model for public Wi-Fi networks and mobile applications. JiWire partners with these services to bring advertising revenue into their services, so they have additional income to provide great public Wi-Fi access and useful mobile applications for the on-the-go lifestyle. 

We work only with public Wi-Fi networks that you have opted in to connect to and with mobile applications that have received your permission before your device transmits any location information. 

Laptops and mobile device on Wi-Fi: Every public Wi-Fi access point in the JiWire network is mapped in our system. When you connect to the hotspots, our servers know the location of the public Wi-Fi access point. In that way, we are able to serve you ads that are relevant to what is currently around you. 

Mobile device: If you explicitly agree to share your location when you sign into an app, that information can be shared with JiWire when an ad is shown on your screen. JiWire works only with apps that offer a clear opt-in dialog box when you open the app. 

JiWire knows you value your privacy and we pledge to protect it and adhere to industry standards for Internet and mobile advertising. We take privacy very seriously and the company does not sell, rent or share any personally identifiable information. 

**What we track**  
JiWire does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, we do not collect your name, email address, phone number or Social Security number, other than as discussed below in **Newsletters and Email**. That means that the JiWire network never knows who you are. 

We do collect some non-personally identifiable information. The non-PII we collect is used for the purpose of targeting and accounting for the delivery of advertising campaigns. 

We use cookies to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer with information about your visit to a particular site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are erased when you close your browser and do not last beyond one visit to Our Sites. Session cookies help us keep track of information such as what service or product you are searching for. A persistent cookie is a small file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These cookies are used to remember items like your login information if you have elected to have it remembered on your computer, and are used to target you for other sites. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to fully use all of the functionality of a site. In particular, session ID cookies are required to store relevant information as a user moves from page to page. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience. 

We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images used on our sites or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and activity on the Site. 

We also collect information in connection with visitors to our partner Wi-Fi networks and mobile applications. We automatically collect and receive information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device type, carrier provider, IP addresses, unique device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited and clicks on advertisements we display. 

**How We Use Information We Track**  
We provide the aggregate non-PII information we track to advertisers, Wi-Fi networks, mobile application providers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties for the purpose of targeting and displaying advertisements that may be of interest to visitors to those networks and sites. 

**Opting Out**  
If you don't want JiWire to identify your device with a Cookie and Web Beacon, you can opt-out by sending an email to [privacy@jiwire.com](mailto:privacy@jiwire.com). The privacy manager will respond within three business days to remove your device from future tracking. 

**Where is data stored?**  
The data we collect is all encrypted, stored securely and backed up daily. Even if someone tried to take this data, it is encrypted so they couldn't read it. But again, the data doesn't include your name or anything that would identify you, so you are always safe. 

**How long is the data stored?**  
JiWire sets cookies to expire after 2 years. The expiration is updated when JiWire's servers identify a device that we had previously seen. JiWire keeps log data for up to 2 years. 

**Tracking of children**  
JiWire doesn't knowingly track the personally identifiable information of people under the age of 13 or knowingly track information from sites directed to people under the age of 13. 

**Newsletters and email**  
We collect email addresses for newsletters, lead generation and other JiWire marketing activities. This data is not part of the JiWire ad network and this information will not be sold, rented or shared with third parties. 

**How to turn off your location-based services**  
If you want to completely turn off location-based services on your iPhone, iPad or Android device, see these helpful instruction at [www.jiwire.com/locationservices](https://web.archive.org/locationservices). By turning off the location-based services, you will lose all the benefits of location-based advertising on your phone. 

**Updates to privacy policy**  
We may change or update our privacy policy at our discretion. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our Site so that any changes are easy to find. We will obtain your consent before making any material changes to information we collect and the manner in which we use it. 

**Questions?** If you have a question or issue with the JiWire Privacy Policy please send an email to [privacy@jiwire.com](mailto:privacy@jiwire.com) or you can send us a letter to: JiWire Inc., Attn: Privacy Policy Manager, 150 Post Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA, 94108.
