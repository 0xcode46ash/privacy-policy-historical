## Information Collection and Use

**Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a Jigsaw Planet account, you provide some personal information, such as your username, password, and email address. Username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on the home page and explore pages. Some Services, such as the home page, public user gallery and explore pages, do not require registration.

**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain and pages visited. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.

**Links:** Jigsaw Planet may keep track of how you interact with links by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.

**Cookies:** Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as explore and looking at public user galleries. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Jigsaw Planet may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. Cookies are stored in your web browser for 180 days or less from your last visit. Current versions of web browsers offer enhanced user controls of cookies (disabling, removing).

**Third Party Services:** Jigsaw Planet uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

**Your Consent:** We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your Jigsaw Planet account.

**Service Providers:** We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.

**Law and Harm:** We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Jigsaw Planet´s rights or property.

**Business Transfers:** In the event that Jigsaw Planet is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

**Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your created puzzles or the number of users who played a particular puzzle or a list of users who played a particular puzzle.
