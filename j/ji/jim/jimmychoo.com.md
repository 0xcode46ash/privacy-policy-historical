Failure to obtain an RMA or return goods using neither DHL nor our London Premier courier service does not affect your statutory rights. 

JCL will not accept returns for any non-faulty items that have been worn and tags removed. Upon receipt of an order, if any item has been received with no tags, customer should notify us (by phone or email) on the same day if they wish to return. We strongly advise all customers to check products thoroughly upon delivery before removing any attached tags and before disposing of any original packaging.

Should you wish to exchange an item for an alternative size, please email us when you request your RMA number and we will reserve it for you if the item is in stock. As soon as we receive your return, we will dispatch your new size to you after the goods have undergone a quality control check. 

If you are located outside the EU you will be required to pay additional taxes and duties on the replacement item. 

Please be aware that we are unable to exchange an item for an alternative colour or style, subject to availability.

JCL will not accept claims for goods which have been repaired or altered in anyway by anyone other than JCL. Furthermore, JCL strongly discourages the addition of rubber protective soles onto JCL products. For details on how to repair your JIMMY CHOOs please contact customer care.
