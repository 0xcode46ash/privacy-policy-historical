### Last Updated: April 25, 2006

At JibJab Media Inc. ("JibJab"), we respect your right to privacy and we understand that members and visitors to JibJab need to control the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below details the measures taken by JibJab to protect your privacy in connection with your use of JibJab.com. However, JibJab's service is designed to allow users to post photographs and information about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting your photograph and/or any personal information, you thereby waive any privacy expectations you have with respect to our use of your likeness or personal information provided to us. If you do not wish to have your picture or information about yourself viewed by or disclosed to others, do not use our Service.

JibJab also allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. JibJab members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. JibJab members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them to our Privacy Statement, linkable from any page on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. Please re-read it often in connection with your use of the JibJab Sites. JibJab cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [support@jibjab.net](mailto:support@jibjab.net).

### Information Collection and Use

JibJab collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age (except with respect to any information submitted by any individuals thirteen years of age or younger, which information JibJab does not solicit, accept or retain) to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the JibJab service. JibJab also collects other data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other and making content recommendation.

JibJab also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes 

User Profile information including members' pictures and usernames are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in JibJab's social networking community. Email addresses are primarily used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join JibJab, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on JibJab with each other through the JibJab service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, JibJab allows users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive communication of this type by changing their "Email Preferences" settings in the user "Account Settings".

From time to time, JibJab or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the JibJab Site(s). Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

### Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members

JibJab members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. JibJab stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friends list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. JibJab also stores names and email addresses provided by members when they forward e-mails (together with any content contained therein) from their friends to their "JokeBox" account solely for the convenience of that member in communicating with his/her friends in the future. JibJab does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations initiated by the member and invitation reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email address). Recipients of invitations from JibJab may contact JibJab to request the removal of their information from our database by clicking on the "Opt-Out" Link at the bottom of our emails. JibJab members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal JibJab address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

You may prevent JibJab email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending an email request to [support@jibjab.net](mailto:support@jibjab.net) or [click here](https://web.archive.org/opt_out) to get to our "Opt-Out" page on the site.
