This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the agreement between JibJab Media Inc. ("JibJab" or “we”) and each visitor, registered user or member, as the case may be (each, a “user” or “you”) concerning the use of the websites owned, controlled, operated or hosted (whether now or in the future) by JibJab and/or its corporate affiliates, including but not limited to the JibJab.com website (collectively the "JibJab Sites"). The other integral parts of such agreement are the JibJab Terms of Service ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/terms_of_service)), the JibJab Terms of Sale ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/terms_of_sale)) and the Legal Notices ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/legal)). All capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall be as defined in the JibJab Terms of Service.

At JibJab, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that you need to control the uses of your personal information. This Privacy Policy details below the measures taken by JibJab to protect your privacy in connection with your use of the JibJab Sites. However, you understand that the JibJab Sites and JibJab's service are designed to allow users to post photographs and information about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting your photograph and/or any personal information, you thereby waive any privacy expectations you have with respect to our use of your likeness or personal information provided to us. If you do not wish to have your picture or information about yourself viewed by or disclosed to others, do not use the JibJab Sites and our service.

JibJab also allows our registered users and members to set up unique personal profiles either directly with JibJab or via third-party sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect). To enrich our users’ experience, we request and display some personal information to other visitors, registered users and members, which allows our users to identify each other. JibJab registered users and members can change their profile information at any time and can control how the service communicates with them.

By using any of the JibJab Sites, you affirmatively consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to have your personal information (to the extent disclosed by you either directly to JibJab or via third-party sign on services) collected by JibJab (or its agents or contractors) and transferred to and processed in the United States.

### Information Collection and Use

JibJab collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the JibJab service. JibJab may also collects other data either directly or via third-party sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect), including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation, in order to enrich the user experience and make content recommendations.

JibJab also logs non-personally-identifiable information such as IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User account information, including pictures and usernames, are displayed in order to enrich the user experience and facilitate user interaction. Email addresses are primarily used for the purposes of sending notifications related to the service. With the exception of notifying friends about content the user has created, a user's email address is not shared or publicly displayed on the JibJab Sites or within the JibJab service. Users' full names, to the extent collected and stored, are never directly revealed to other users.

When you create an account and become a registered user or member of JibJab, we will send you a “verification” email to ask you to verify your email address and account by following the instructions provided in the email. Such verification is necessary to complete your registration and activate your account. It is important that you verify your email address so that we may communicate with you regarding your account, your purchases and/or other transactions with JibJab, changes in our Terms of Service, Terms of Sale and/or Privacy Policy, and other matters relating to your account with JibJab. It also enables us to send you announcement emails about our new content, features, services, products, promotions, etc. You may opt out of receiving announcement emails from us at any time, by following the opt-out link contained in an announcement email you previously received, or by logging into the “My Account” section of the JibJab Site(s) where you have an account and changing your email preferences in the account settings. If you do not provide verification within 2 days after we send the initial verification email, we will send one reminder email to you. If there is still no verification by you within 2 days after we send the reminder email, we will consider your registration/account incomplete and inactive. If your registration/account status remains incomplete and inactive for more than 7 days after your initial registration, we reserve the right to cancel your registration/account without notice.

From time to time, JibJab or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the JibJab Sites. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

### Use of Cookies

JibJab uses cookies to store user preferences, account status, traffic origination, and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that users are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information.

### Invitations and Other Communications to Non-users

JibJab users can send content to friends via our system and invite friends to join the service via third-party single sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect). JibJab stores the email addresses that users provide so that JibJab can send notifications authorized by users and related reminders to such email addresses. JibJab does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides those initiated by users and invitation reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email address). Recipients of emails from JibJab may contact JibJab to request the removal of their information from our database by clicking on the "Opt-Out" Link at the bottom of our emails. JibJab users may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal JibJab address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

You may prevent JibJab messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending an email request to support@jibjab.net or by clicking here to get to our "Opt-Out" page on the site. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.
