### Last Updated: February 28, 2011

This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the agreement between JibJab Media Inc. ("JibJab" or “we”) and each visitor, registered user or member, as the case may be (each, a “user” or “you”) concerning the use of the websites owned, controlled, operated or hosted (whether now or in the future) by JibJab and/or its corporate affiliates, including but not limited to the JibJab.com website (collectively the "JibJab Sites"). The other integral parts of such agreement are the JibJab Terms of Service ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/terms_of_service)), the JibJab Terms of Sale ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/terms_of_sale)) and the Legal Notices ([click here](http://sendables.jibjab.com/about/legal)). All capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy shall be as defined in the JibJab Terms of Service.

At JibJab, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that you need to control the uses of your personal information. This Privacy Policy details below the measures taken by JibJab to protect your privacy in connection with your use of the JibJab Sites. However, you understand that the JibJab Sites and JibJab's service are designed to allow users to post photographs and information about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting your photograph and/or any personal information, you thereby waive any privacy expectations you have with respect to our use of your likeness or personal information provided to us. If you do not wish to have your picture or information about yourself viewed by or disclosed to others, do not use the JibJab Sites and our service.

JibJab also allows our registered users and members to set up unique personal profiles either directly with JibJab or via third-party sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect). To enrich our users’ experience, we request and display some personal information to other visitors, registered users and members, which allows our users to identify each other. JibJab registered users and members can change their profile information at any time and can control how the service communicates with them.

By using any of the JibJab Sites, you affirmatively consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to have your personal information (to the extent disclosed by you either directly to JibJab or via third-party sign on services) collected by JibJab (or its agents or contractors) and transferred to and processed in the United States.

### Your California Privacy Rights

Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law) provides that, if an individual who is a California resident has provided his/her personal information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such individual’s personal information to a third party and knows or should have known that such third party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what personal information was shared and with whom the information was shared. A business may comply with this law by: (1) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information for third-party direct marketing use unless the customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information for third-party direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent his/her personal information from being shared for third-party direct marketing use; AND (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that right.

California residents may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to [support@JibJab.com](mailto:support@JibJab.com) or writing to us at **JibJab Media Inc., Att: Privacy Dept., PO Box 5356, Santa Monica, CA, 90405**. Please note that, under the law, we are not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any requests that are not sent to the above-designated email or mailing address.

### Information Collection and Use

JibJab collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the JibJab service. JibJab may also collects other data either directly or via third-party sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect), including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation, in order to enrich the user experience and make content recommendations.

JibJab also logs non-personally-identifiable information such as IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User account information, including pictures and usernames, are displayed in order to enrich the user experience and facilitate user interaction. Email addresses are primarily used for the purposes of sending notifications related to the service. With the exception of notifying friends about content the user has created, a user's email address is not shared or publicly displayed on the JibJab Sites or within the JibJab service. Users' full names, to the extent collected and stored, are never directly revealed to other users.

When you create an account and become a registered user or member of JibJab, we will send you a “verification” email to ask you to verify your email address and account by following the instructions provided in the email. Such verification is necessary to complete your registration and activate your account. It is important that you verify your email address so that we may communicate with you regarding your account, your purchases and/or other transactions with JibJab, changes in our Terms of Service, Terms of Sale and/or Privacy Policy, and other matters relating to your account with JibJab. It also enables us to send you announcement emails about our new content, features, services, products, promotions, etc. You may opt out of receiving announcement emails from us at any time, by following the opt-out link contained in an announcement email you previously received, or by logging into the “My Account” section of the JibJab Site(s) where you have an account and changing your email preferences in the account settings. If you do not provide verification within 2 days after we send the initial verification email, we will send one reminder email to you. If there is still no verification by you within 2 days after we send the reminder email, we will consider your registration/account incomplete and inactive. If your registration/account status remains incomplete and inactive for more than 7 days after your initial registration, we reserve the right to cancel your registration/account without notice.

From time to time, JibJab or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the JibJab Sites. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

### Use of Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies

A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from an Internet server and stored in your computer. JibJab uses cookies (including Flash cookies) to store user preferences, account status, traffic origination, and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that users are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies (other than Flash cookies), or notify you when a cookie (other than a Flash cookie) is set — each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences — however, you must enable cookies from JibJab in order to use most functions on the JibJab Sites. For more information about Flash cookies and how to remove them from your computer, please see the paragraph below entitled “SPECIAL NOTE – Flash Cookies.”

In addition, JibJab may use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “web bugs,” “clear GIFs,” etc. (collectively “ **Web Beacons** ”) to collect information about your visits to the JibJab Sites. These are small electronic images embedded in web content (including online ads) and email messages and are ordinarily not visible to users. Like cookies, Web Beacons enable us to track pages and content (including ads) accessed and viewed by users on the JibJab Sites. Also, when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to plain text) emails to our users, Web Beacons may be embedded in such emails to allow us to monitor readership levels so that we can identify aggregate trends and individual usage to provide our users with more relevant content or offers. Web beacons in emails may recognize activities such as when an email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in the email were clicked on, etc. Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive our Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.

Please note that JibJab allows thirty-party advertisers (including those that are serving their own ads on the JibJab Sites, as well as those so-called “network advertisers” or “ad networks” who are serving and managing ads for others) to set and use their own cookies (including Flash cookies) and/or Web Beacons on your computer when you visit the JibJab Sites. These cookies and Web Beacons allow third-party advertisers to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement and to compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. The information so compiled allows third-party advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

Use of cookies (including Flash cookies) and Web Beacons by third-party advertisers is governed by the privacy policies of those advertisers – not the JibJab Privacy Policy. JibJab has no control over what information is collected by third-party advertisers or how they may use the information. The privacy policies and data practices of such third-party advertisers may significantly differ from those of JibJab, and JibJab makes no representation or warranty whatsoever about third-party advertisers’ data policies and practices. For more information regarding the data practices of some of these third-party advertisers and how to opt out of their use of your information, please visit

Prior to using any third-party functionalities (e.g., Facebook Connect) on the JibJab Sites, you should consult the privacy notices of the third-party providers of such functionalities (e.g., Facebook). Once again, we have no control over what information is collected by such third parties, or how they may use the information. The privacy policies and data practices of such third parties may significantly differ from ours, and we make no representation or warranty whatsoever about their data policies and practices. Your communications and interactions with such third parties are solely between you and them, and are at your own risk.

### SPECIAL NOTE – DoubleClick’s DART Cookie:

JibJab may allow third-party advertisers to use DoubleClick’s DART cookie when serving ads on the JibJab Sites.

### Invitations and Other Communications to Non-users

JibJab users can send content to friends via our system and invite friends to join the service via third-party single sign-on services (e.g., Facebook Connect). JibJab stores the email addresses that users provide so that JibJab can send notifications authorized by users and related reminders to such email addresses. JibJab does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides those initiated by users and invitation reminders initiated by JibJab (one (1) per email address). Recipients of emails from JibJab may contact JibJab to request the removal of their information from our database by clicking on the "Opt-Out" Link at the bottom of our emails. JibJab users may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal JibJab address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

You may prevent JibJab messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending an email request to support@jibjab.net or by clicking here to get to our "Opt-Out" page on the site. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.
