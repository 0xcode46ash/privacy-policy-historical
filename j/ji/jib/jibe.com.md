The purpose of the password is to enable AR’s users to access secure forums and for the use of future AR premium services. If you forget your password, you will be asked to go on the AR Web site, answer your security question and create a new password. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the registered e-mail address you specify. No plain text passwords will ever be passed through e-mail. 

Additionally, we may use Your Account Information: 

> • To validate you as a user when connected to the AR service  
>  • For license reporting and assessment of service levels;  
>  • To better understand on an aggregated basis how our products are used, gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users of our products and services;

>  • To provide you with information about AR products, services, news and events through the Software, the Site or e-mail;

When you register for permanent opt-out, you provide us with a validated e-mail address at which you no longer wish to receive AR information. If necessary, we will send you an opt-out confirmation e-mail to the address you enter. You must respond to that e-mail to complete the opt-out process. This information will only be used to honor your opt-out request and not be shared with any third-party. Opt-out users may change or delete their information by contacting AR at [info@advancedreality.com](mailto:info@advancedreality.com).

AR is committed to protecting your privacy. We will only share Your Information with third parties in accordance with your instructions and in order to provide you specific services. We may share aggregated and anonymous demographic information with our business partners but no such information can be linked directly to Your Account Information. 

Although we will use every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy (and that of your contacts), we may need to disclose Your Information, including personally identifiable information, when required by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on AR and/or the Site (see Government Authority below for more information). We will notify you of such actions where reasonable and permitted by law.   
  
  |  **4\. Children**

AR does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and AR does not target its Services and Software to children under 13. 

(b) If you are 13 or younger, you are prohibited from downloading the Software and/or using the Services. If laws in your country prohibit you from entering into a valid and enforceable agreement with us because of your age – in many countries, because you are under 18 years of age - you are prohibited from downloading the Software and using the Services. 

(c) BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU WARRANT TO AR THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE AGE OF 13 AND ENTITLED TO ENTER INTO A VALID AND ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT WITH US.

You have the right to access, correct, update, and/or delete Your Information at any time. You can do so by using the Software or by logging into the Site with your username and password. You will retain these rights even in the event of a business transition (see Change of Ownership or Other Business Transition section for more information). 

Changes to your information are typically executed immediately. For example, if you delete your account, your account immediately becomes inaccessible and all Your Information within your account is completely removed from the AR Servers.   
  
  |  Change of Ownership or Other Business Transition

In the event AR goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets (a “Business Transition”), your membership in the AR Network™ and the AR servers containing Your Information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. In such event, you will be notified via e-mail and/or through a notice on our Web site and any other appropriate methods prior to the Business Transition, and AR’s custody of Your Information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this Privacy Policy.

Following a Business Transition, AR or its successors will continue to use Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we plan to use Your Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail and/or through a notice on our Web site and any other appropriate methods. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use Your Information in this different manner. Whether or not you wish to have Your Information used in this different manner, you will retain ownership rights to Your Information and the ability to delete Your Information at any time.

This policy is one that AR will continue to honor regardless of merger or business transaction.

Log Files and Backups

Like most Internet services, we use log files, both on the client and server side. The data held in log files includes your IP address, browser type, e-mail application, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity. AR uses server log data to analyze trends, administer the Services and the Site, and improve service levels. IP addresses are not tied to any Personally Identifiable Information.

The Software has associated log and temporary files that are stored on your local hard drive and on AR’s servers. These files store Your Account Information, your permissions, preference settings, system notifications as well as other data necessary to operate the AR browser plug-in. Your Information resides on AR’s servers, unless you have chosen to disable the Software in which case your information will be deleted permanently from our servers.

Your Information may also exist temporarily within regularly performed server backups. AR retains backups for a period no greater than 30 days before deleting them.

This option is offered at time of download but can be changed by sending an email to [accountupdate@advancedreality.com](mailto:accountupdate@advancedreality.com).

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement which is not promotional in nature. This announcement may notify you of changes to the Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Service Agreement, as well as planned service suspensions and outages. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account. These notifications will generally be sent to a validated e-mail address for your account.
