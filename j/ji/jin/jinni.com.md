# Find movies, TV shows matching your taste and watch online

Jinni Media Ltd. ("Jinni") respects your privacy and is fully committed to protecting the personal information that you share with us. The guidelines contained herein (the "Privacy Policy") explain the information we collect and what we use it for. We hope this straightforward explanation will allay your concerns.

By using the Website and Service (as these terms are defined in the [Terms of Use](http://www.jinni.com/terms.html)) you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices please do not enter or use our Website and the Service.

When you register on the Website, you voluntarily submit certain personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, for the purpose of creating an account associated with a registered user ("Member") of the Website and for using the Service. Jinni may require additional personal information in order to provide you with additional features you may be interested in. For example, your location is needed to tell you which movies are on TV or in theaters near you. If you take the Movie Personality Quiz to tell us about your viewing preferences, we can offer you tailored features like recommendations and taste matches with other users. Jinni will store the personal information for the sole purpose of providing you with the Services of your choice. You can always change the information in your account in the manner detailed in this Privacy Policy.

Jinni also collects some non-personally identifiable data, such as your IP address, browser software identification and the domain from which you entered the Website, in order to enhance your experience on the Website and help us determine which content interests Website's visitors. Jinni also collects statistical information in the aggregate, for example to show average ratings for titles.

If you choose to purchase movie tickets, DVDs or other products or services by clicking on a third party link (e.g. Fandango) from the Website, we will not collect any personal information related to the transaction (credit card number, address, etc.). The only information we collect in this case is the number of Members who clicked on such links, and the number of purchases made by these Members. However, we recommend that you read any third party's website privacy policy in order to know what kind of information they are collecting.

## Profile

We display Member's personal information on their profile and elsewhere on the Website according to the settings you choose in your account. This information can be seen by all visitors of the Website. As with any online service, we recommend you think carefully about what personal information to share on your profile.

## Movie Personality

From the moment you create your profile and take the Movie Personality Quiz, Jinni generates a Movie Personality for you, and begins offering you personal recommendations, and taste matches with other Members. We refine your Movie Personality by following your activities on the Website, including how you rate titles, which titles you watch on the Website, and what you recommend to others. This information is intended to improve your recommendations and taste matches.

Jinni does not process any personally identifiable information related to your viewing preferences and/or profile in any other way. However, note that any other Member can see your activity meter (a measure of your overall activity level on the Website), your Movie Personality description (if you choose to show it in your account settings), and your taste compatibility with them.

## Who We Share Information With

We consider the personally identifiable information contained in our database to be confidential. We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to third parties who work for us.

We will disclose your personally identifiable information if required by law, regulation or government authority, or to protect the rights and property of Jinni, its affiliates or the public. For example, we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.

## Underage User

Jinni does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, and does not wish to do so. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as name and e-mail address) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.

Cookies are a standard Internet technology used by many major websites to provide useful features. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Jinni transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to allow our systems to recognize your browser and provide some tailored features. Please remember that cookies cannot read your hard drive or give information to any third party.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to fully enjoy some of Jinni's best features.

You can view and change your personal profile at any time. If you wish, you can terminate your account on the Website from the "My Account" page. You can choose not to receive news and other emails from Jinni by changing the settings in "My Account."

We may offer some features with other providers, and our Website may display links to other websites whose privacy policies and practices we don't control. We advise you to read their privacy policies to learn how they handle your personal information.

Jinni takes precautions to protect the security of your information, as well as our own information and network. We use firewalls and store all of our files and information on secure terminals. All user passwords are protected by encryption technology. 

You are responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your password and computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

We may change this privacy statement from time to time. We will post the changes on the Website to ensure you are updated on how information is collected, used, and disclosed. By continuing to use the Website, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as modified. If you are concerned about how your information is handled, you should periodically check this page.

In the event of a merger, acquisition or reorganization of Jinni ownership, user information will likely be a part of the assets transferred. An acquiring company may substantially change this privacy policy. Jinni will endeavor to notify all users of any such changes.
