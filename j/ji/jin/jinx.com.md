J!NX asks for billing and shipping address information when a customer is ready to checkout. This address information is not, and WILL NOT, be sold to other companies to encourage more junk mail. We keep all customer information private. We also require a valid phone number. This helps us cut down on fraud and protect the online shopper. 

Upon checkout, the customer is asked if they would like to be included in our mailing list for product updates. This is not required and if the customer does NOT check this box, the denial is honored. If the customer chooses NOT to be included, they will not receive newsletters or mass email from us. If they do choose to be added to our mailing list, either via ordering or the subscribe box in the sidebar, they can easily unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of our newsletter.
