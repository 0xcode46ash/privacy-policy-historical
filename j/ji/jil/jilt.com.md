# Privacy Policy - Jilt

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Jilt we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.



Jilt™ (“Jilt”) is owned and operated by SkyVerge®, Inc. (“SkyVerge” or “Jilt”). SkyVerge operates several websites including skyverge.com, shopstorm.com, getjilt.com, and sellwithwp.com. It is SkyVerge’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

This privacy policy covers the use of Jilt services, applications (“App” or “Apps”), or features (collectively, the “Services”), and your use of getjilt.com, jiltapp.com, or any related websites (collectively referred to as the “Sites”).

### Collecting Information __

Like most website operators, Jilt collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Jilt’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Jilt’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Jilt may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Jilt also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Jilt only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Jilt collects email addresses of people who send us email. We also collect information on what pages users access and information provided to us by users via surveys and site registrations. Such information may contain personal data about you including your address, phone numbers, etc. We are not allowed to disclose such personal information without your written permission. However, certain information collected from you and about you is used within the context of providing our services to you. The information we collect is not shared with, sold or rented to others except under certain circumstances and which your use of the Apps or services is deemed to provide to us a valid consent to disclose the following:

  * Jilt may share personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Jilt’s [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms/), or as otherwise required by law.
  * Jilt employs other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Jilt may also share your information to provide products or services you’ve requested or when we have your permission.
  * We will transfer information about you if Jilt is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Jilt will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Jilt web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at help@getjilt.com.

### Disclosure __

  1. Jilt may use third party service providers to provide certain services to you and we may share Personal Information with such service providers. We require any company with which we may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of Apps or Services for Jilt.
  2. Jilt may disclose Personal Information under special circumstances, such as to comply with court orders requiring us to do so or when your actions violate the Terms of Service.
  3. We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.



### Client Data Storage __

Jilt owns the data storage, databases, and all rights to Jilt applications; however we make no claim to the rights of your data. You retain all rights to your data.
