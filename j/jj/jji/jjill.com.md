# J. Jill - Privacy & Security

  


Privacy Policy   
At J. Jill, we understand your concerns about online security and privacy. We seek to ensure that your personal and payment information is secure and your privacy is respected. We hope this policy statement provides you with answers to the questions you may have about our privacy and security policies. If you have further questions, please contact us by phone at **1.800.343.5700** or [email us anytime](https://web.archive.org/web/20130805071703id_/http%3A//www.jjill.com/jjillonline/customer/CustomerServiceForm.aspx?BID=400843869&h=M&sk=M). 

What information do we collect?    
In order to provide the services you request, we ask you for certain kinds of personal information. When you sign up with us, visit our web site, request to "chat" with a customer service associate, send us an email, place an order or make a purchase at our stores, you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit or debit card number. If you participate in one of our promotions, contests or surveys, you may provide us with additional personal information such as your age or date of birth. In addition to this information, we also maintain a record of your purchases from jjill.com, our catalog and our stores. On occasion, we may combine information you provide with other demographic information available to us. 

In addition, for each visitor to the web site, our web server automatically collects the following non-personally identifiable information: your Internet service provider's address, the referring URL, and information on the pages you access on our site. 

What do we do with the information we collect?    
When we take an order on the phone or when you make a purchase online or at a store, we use your information to process your order or purchase, answer questions you may have, mail catalogs to you, and provide you with periodic emails and mailings about our merchandise and promotions. From time to time we may also send you email offers on behalf of marketing partners whose products and/or services we think may be of interest to you. 

Currently, we also gather online information about your purchases and shopping activities to improve the content of our web site, to enhance your online shopping experience, and to use in future marketing and promotional activities for our web site, our catalogs and our J. Jill stores. 

Will J. Jill share my information with third parties?    
In some instances, we use third party companies to provide services for us, including assistance in maintaining and managing customer information, providing customer and Internet services, taking and fulfilling orders, conducting J. Jill promotions and surveys, and communicating effectively with our clients. Some of these vendors are given access to some or all of the information you provide to us, including your email address and credit card information, and may use cookies on our behalf. Except as disclosed in this Policy, J. Jill does not authorize such third parties to make use of personally identifiable information other than to provide J. Jill with these services. If you apply for the J. Jill credit card online, you provide the personal information needed to process your application (including your social security number) directly to World Financial Capital Bank (WFCB), the issuer and the administrator of the credit card program. If you apply for the J. Jill credit card by phone or in the stores, we collect that information from you and provide it to WFCB. WFCB is independent of J. Jill and has its own privacy and security policies. 

We use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user.
