Where possible we will automatically renew your policy for a further 12 months.

Automatic credit card renewal ensures that you never have to worry about travelling uninsured. We will debit your payment card annually.

Contact details will be provided along with your renewal quotation so that you can get in touch if you need to make any changes to your cover, for instance; declare a medical condition, add extra cover for sports or activities, change the geographic area or the level of cover required.

Payment will be taken from your card on the renewal date. If we are unable to renew your policy for any reason, we will contact you by email, letter or telephone.

If you would prefer not to automatically renew your Annual Travel Insurance you can let us know by email, telephone or letter at any time. In this instance, we will contact you to let you know when your policy is due to expire but will not issue a new policy or charge your card unless you instruct us to do so.

Once your policy has been renewed, whether automatically or after your instruction, you have a 14 day cooling off period, when you can cancel the cover and receive a full refund, provided no claim has been made. 

We are unable to automatically renew your policy, if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.
