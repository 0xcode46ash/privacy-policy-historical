At the time that we create and post the web pages that require these software plug-ins for viewing, they are provided by their manufacturer for download and use free of charge. We can not guaranty, however, that the plug-in will remain free, or that the manufacturer will not collect personally identifying information about you when you elect to download the software from its site. If you choose to visit the manufacturer's web site to obtain the plug-in, please carefully review the manufacturer's posted policies for details about personal privacy and use of downloaded plug-ins.
