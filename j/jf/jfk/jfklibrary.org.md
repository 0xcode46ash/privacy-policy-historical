We consider "personally identifying information" to be: your name or a unique identifier (such as an IP address), your e-mail address, your mailing address, your telephone number, and any financial information relating to you or your accounts that you may provide to us. 

Our system does not use "persistent cookies." We consider "persistent cookies" to be computer files that a web site surreptitiously places on your computer system without your knowledge or permission. 

Our system collects server log data which will include your IP address, your domain name, the type of browser and operating system you used, the pages you viewed, search requests, in some cases data you submitted via web forms, and, if you linked to our site from another web site, that web site's address. This data helps us to ascertain the volume of our web site users' interest in portions of our web site, and helps us understand how to improve the navigation and content of our web site. 

Personally identifying information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information or products to you, or to respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, library, or NARA staff, Foundation staff, or our contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level of customer satisfaction with our services. 

We do not sell any personal information to third parties. 

We may transfer personal information to a third party only in the following cases: 

  * To a bank or United States Department of the Treasury account, which must receive payment for a transaction that you initiated; 
  * To a company that is contracted to assist us with specific services, including electronic commerce or donations, and which agrees not to sell or use personal information for other purposes; 
  * To legal authorities if we suspect that you are attempting to change or otherwise damage this web site, or you are using it in violation of Federal or local laws; 
  * To the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, a non-governmental 501(c)(3) organization that supports the programs and activities of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, when you use our online services to make a donation; or 
  * To Congress or a court in response to a subpoena. 



Some parts of this site use browser plug-ins. While the plug-ins are needed to view or listen to some content, you retain control and choice about conducting the download. At the time that we create and post the web pages that require these software plug-ins for viewing, they are provided by their manufacturer for download and use free of charge. We can not guarantee, however, that the plug-in will remain free, or that the manufacturer will not collect personally identifying information about you when you elect to download the software from its site. If you choose to visit the manufacturer's web site to obtain the plug-in, please carefully review the manufacturer's posted policies for details about personal privacy and use of downloaded plug-ins. 

Although questions, comments, and other communications that we receive generally are not retained as permanent records, please note that it is possible that any mail, electronic or paper, that we (or any Federal agency, for that matter) receive could become part of the permanent record of the agency, if the mail is part of materials that are scheduled for permanent retention.
