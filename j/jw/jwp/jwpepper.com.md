# J.W. Pepper & Son, Inc. Privacy Statement

**The J.W. Pepper & Son, Inc. Internet Privacy Policy**

Since our founding in 1876, J.W. Pepper's goals have been to provide the best possible service for our customers, and to treat customers with respect and loyalty. Our customers have rewarded our efforts by making J.W. Pepper one of the world's largest retailers of printed music. Buying from Pepper means buying from someone you trust. This 125-year tradition continues in the age of the Internet. 

**Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors:**

Pepper does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information on visitors to our Web site ([http://www.jwpepper.com](http://www.jwpepper.com/)) unless the visitor chooses to provide information, for example to open an account and place an order, or to take advantage of information services available on our Web site. If information is provided by the user for these purposes, we will use it only for internal purposes.   
Today, Internet browser software (for example Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer) automatically sends to visited Web sites anonymous information including the internet domain name the user came from, and which browser software version the user has. This does not include personal identifying information such as the visitor's e-mail address or name. Operators of Internet sites sometimes use this anonymous statistical information to decide what Web site features are popular and which aren't, a similar process to TV ratings. Pepper may choose to engage in similar analysis of overall or "aggregate" Web site use, but remember, unless you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, your visit to our Web site is anonymous. Even if you are a Pepper customer who has chosen to give us your name and address to open an account, we do not connect that information to aggregate statistical studies on Web site usage. 

**"Cookie" Files**

Our Web site uses an "order basket" system that allows customers freedom to assemble their order before making the purchase, to explore various parts of our Web site while assembling the order basket, and even to leave our Web site and return (during the same browser session) without losing the order in progress. It's like being able to browse, with a shopping cart, in a supermarket that sells printed music.   
To keep everyone's order separate and accurate, the computer needs to connect each Web site user with their order basket. Otherwise, it would be like being in a supermarket where nobody could remember which shopping cart they were using. Everyone's groceries would get mixed up.   
Our "cookie" file system assigns a number to each shopper and each order basket. If you are shopper number 1234 and your order basket is number 1234, the computer always knows where to put your purchases   
The "cookie" file from Pepper is a number that resides in your computer's memory until you close your browser, at which time it disappears. Although some Web sites will write the "cookie" file to your computer's hard drive, the cookie file from Pepper's site disappears the moment you close your Web browser and is not written to your hard drive.   
If you prefer to set your browser to reject all "cookie" files, our Web site will still function normally for information and searching uses, but you will experience a reduction in our ability to track the contents of your order basket. 

**Use of Information:**

In the age of the Internet, many Web sites are supported to a large degree by advertising revenue. Pepper's is not. Our Web site exists to provide our customers with the world's best online service in printed music and related products. Customer information is not supplied or sold to third parties. Notwithstanding the above, Pepper may disclose information if required to do so by law. 

**Security Measures:**

**Customer online accounts:**

Pepper's online services include the ability of our customers to monitor the progress of their order and shipping status. Pepper keeps this information secure by limiting access to customers who have been issued valid ID and PIN (Personal Identification Number) numbers. Customers should keep their ID and PIN in a secure location to protect the privacy of their account information. This applies to any future security measures, log-on methods, and passwords issued by Pepper to its customers. 

**Credit card information:**

Credit Card information may be transmitted by customers to Pepper via secure encryption technology at the customer's option, and is thereafter kept in our mainframe computer, behind the Internet "firewall" that restricts access from the Internet. In order to further customer security, credit card numbers are not stored for future use by the customer, and must be re-entered with each new purchase. 

**Transmission over the Internet:**

Information transmitted to any Web site travels via the interconnected network of computers called the Internet. While Pepper has implemented measures to protect customer privacy once information reaches our Web site computer, users who may have concerns about the privacy of their information have the option of placing orders using our toll-free telephone and fax numbers, or via mail:

Toll-free telephone: 1.800.345.6296  
Toll-free fax: 1.800.260.1482  
Mail: P.O. Box 850, Valley Forge, PA 19482.

Customer Access to Data and Ability to Correct Personal Data:

Customers may review, correct, and delete information in their account at any time using the "My Account" feature on the Pepper Web site. 

**Email advertising Opt-in and Opt-out:**

Customers who have opened Pepper accounts may chose to subscribe (Opt-in) to J.W. Pepper Online Music Clubs which from time to time send information on new products via e-mail. Pepper may also add existing customers to an e-mail advertising list. Either way, customers who have received e-mail from Pepper may cancel their e-mail Music Club subscription at any time (Opt-out) by accessing the "My Account" feature on the Pepper Web site. 

**Customers under the age of 16:**

It is Pepper's policy not to knowingly sell to or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. 

**Right to Contact Users:**

Pepper reserves the right to contact users of its Web site who have provided e-mail addresses regarding account status; changes to any policies; and other information we feel may be of interest. 

**Right to Change Privacy Statement**

Due to the fast-changing nature of the Internet, Pepper reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time with or without notice. Users of the Pepper Web site are encouraged to review this information from time to time, as all changes will be effective as to new and previous visitors. 

**Links to and from Other Web Sites**

Pepper's privacy policy applies only to our own Web site. While Pepper may provide links to other Web sites, it is the customer's responsibility to read and understand the terms of use and the privacy policies posted on other Web sites.
