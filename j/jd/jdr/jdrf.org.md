THIS DOCUMENT SETS FORTH THE PRIVACY POLICY (“PRIVACY POLICY”) FOR JDRF (“WE”, “US” OR “OUR”) WEBSITES (COLLECTIVELY, “SITE”). WHERE APPLICABLE, THIS PRIVACY POLICY INCLUDES THE CHILD PRIVACY POLICY ADDENDUM. JDRF VALUES THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND IS COMMITTED TO THE PRIVACY OF SITE USERS. THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS THE MANNER IN WHICH JDRF COLLECTS, USES, MAINTAINS, DISCLOSES AND SECURES INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM USERS OF THE SITE. BY USING THE SITE IN ANY WAY, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE SITE.

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
During your interactions with the Site, such as when you register with the Site, JDRF may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, date of birth, postal address, email address, and telephone number. We use this information to validate Site users and facilitate participation in various JDRF services as specified on the Site. If we need to contact you regarding the Site, our services, your account or your use of the Site, this information may be used to contact you. If you send us e-mail, we will retain your email and any applicable response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have and to measure how effectively we address your concerns. JDRF retains such personally identifiable information only for as long as is necessary depending on the reason for your submission, and collects no more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the services for which such information is collected. We do not share this information with any third parties except as noted in the Child Privacy Policy Addendum where applicable.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
To help us enhance and optimize users’ overall Site experience, we may collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit. Examples of non-personally-identifiable information may include your Internet access provider, your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your user profile, your browser and operating system, the date and time of your visit, and data based on your use of the Site. JDRF collects non-personally-identifiable information in order to, among other things, provide you with or assist in the provision of information through the Site and to maintain the performance of the Site. This data is not associated with any of your personal information and is not shared with any third parties.

**Cookies**  
Like most standard website servers, JDRF may use cookies and other tools to collect information about how you use the Site. A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer hard drive when you visit a Site. If you do not want JDRF to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit to us through the Site.

**SECURITY**

**Encryption**  
JDRF takes extensive precautions to protect our users’ information, both online and offline.

If you submit sensitive personal information through the Site such as a date of birth or credit card information, we have implemented what we believe to be industry-standard robust encryption in order to help us keep your information secure and accurate.

**Additional Safeguards**  
JDRF maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of any personally identifiable information that you disclose to JDRF. JDRF utilizes what JDRF believes to be industry best security measures to protect personally identifiable information under JDRF’s control, and JDRF limits access to your personally identifiable information within JDRF and JDRF’s affiliates to those employees who need to know such personally identifiable information to provide information, services and/or products to you. However, due to the nature of the Internet and computer systems, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure, regardless of JDRF’s best intentions. As such, JDRF cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personally identifiable information you transmit to JDRF.

**External Links or References**  
While JDRF does not display any third party advertising on the Site, the Site may contain links or references to other parties’ sites, including sponsors of JDRF or JDRF’s services. JDRF is not responsible for the privacy or other practices of any such outside sites, and JDRF expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such sites.

JDRF requires these parties to use such personally identifiable information only for an authorized purpose on behalf of JDRF and consistent with this Privacy Policy.

In the event JDRF goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, bankruptcy, or selling a portion of its assets, unless personally identifiable information is collected through a Site for which the Child Privacy Policy Addendum is applicable, users’ personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred.

We use personally identifiable information collected through the Site to validate Site users and facilitate participation in the Kids Walk program all for the sole benefit of the participating schools and such schools’ students. We do not share child personally identifiable information with any third parties except the child’s respective school where necessary to facilitate the child’s involvement in Kids Walk.

JDRF has provided such school with notice of its collection, use and disclosure practices. In the event we require additional personally identifiable information from a student under the age of 13, we will notify the student’s parent or guardian before we collect such information and require that the parent or guardian affirmatively consent to such collection (as well as our use and/or disclosure of such information) in advance.
