**PRIVACY POLICY**  
JDA is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. To that end, we have prepared this Privacy Statement to disclose and describe our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Web Site. 

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
In general, you may visit our Web Site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Some portions of the Web Site may require you to give us personally identifiable information, which is information that enables us to identify you, such as your name, email or other address. Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. However, privacy is very important to us. We recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not give, loan, or sell any personally identifiable information to any third party, unless legally required to do so. We may store and process personal information to better understand your needs. In addition we may use the information to contact you. If you use our Web Site to receive support services for a JDA product that you use, you may be required to supply personal information in order to receive these services via our Web Site, and we may use the information in order to perform services to you. 

**NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site from which you liked to our Web Site. 

**SECURITY POLICY**  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We use industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We also employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside JDA. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. 

**IP ADDRESSES**  
We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers – the big computers that “serve” up Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the guests’ IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. In addition, certain non-personally identifiable information is recorded by the standard operation of our Internet servers. This information allows us to keep our Web Site running efficiently. The information we record includes the browser (such as Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) and the operating system used (such as Macintosh, Windows 2000, etc.) by the visitor. Another use of this type of information includes the number of visitors to the various pages in our Web Site but only in a combined and non-personally-identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information about visitors to our Web Site are known only when voluntarily submitted. 

**COOKIES**  
We use a feature on your Internet browser called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files created on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to let it know that you are a prior customer. We also use cookies to retrieve certain information previously provided by you to our Web Site, so that you will not need to re-enter this information every time you visit our Web Site. We will not use cookies to store personal/business information. 

Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know who you are, even though we may assign the browser on your computer a cookie. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookies is stored. Please refer to your Internet browser’s instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 

**EXTERNAL LINKS**  
As stated in the Legal Terms above, our Web Site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**ACCEPTANCE AND CHANGES**  
By using our Web Site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Web Site. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. All changes will become effective immediately and you will not receive notice of these changes. 

**CONTACTING THE WEB SITE**  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Web Site, or your dealings with our Web Site, please contact [webmaster@jda.com](mailto:webmaster@jda.com).
