A cookie is a small text file that is saved on your computer to store your preferences or help “remember” information you previously gave us. A cookie cannot retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses.  The use of cookies allows us to improve the quality of our service, including storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, tracking user trends, such as how people navigate our site and, in general, we use them to customize the website for you.  We also use cookies to make sure you don’t see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our sites. Our site uses cookies to track your progression through our Web sites during your visit.  Our third-party advertisers may use cookies and other types of “clickstream data” information about your visit to our sites.  The information collected by these third-party affiliates can be aggregated and used to target advertising on our sites, for market research and for other similar purposes.  The clickstream data does not include personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address or phone number.  You may set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do so, certain areas of our site may not function on your computer.

The fraudsters who collect this information then use it to steal your money or your identity or both.  If you suspect an attempted phishing event involving the use of the J.D. Power and Associates name on its own, or on behalf of one of our clients, please notify us of this incident at 1-888-JDPOWER (888-537-6937).
