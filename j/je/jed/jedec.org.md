# Privacy Policy | JEDEC

### JEDEC’s Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the JEDEC website. On some pages, you can order publication subscriptions, contact JEDEC, register to download published JEDEC standards and documents free of charge, register to become a JEDEC member, or register to attend a JEDEC event. The types of personal information collected on these pages are:

  * Name
  * Company
  * Email address
  * Committee(s) of interest (optional)



For publication subscription orders, new member registrations and event registrations we may also collect:

  * Credit/Debit Card Information (including billing address/phone number)
  * Mailing address
  * Phone number



JEDEC reserves the right to use cookies to identify single sessions, in which case a cookie will temporarily be written. This type of cookie is deleted as soon as you close your browser and is not stored permanently.

### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order, registering as a new member or registering to attend an event only to complete the request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the request.

For free download registrants, we do not share the information you provide to any outside parties. During the free download registration process, you may choose to opt-in to our email list or to receive additional information on selected committees. Information you submit during this registration process will not be used to contact you unless you choose to opt-in or request password/username assistance.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive via the “contact us” process. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

For new members, JEDEC uses the email address provided for each company representative to contact you on an ongoing basis with information about your assigned committees and subcommittees.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

### How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

Users who have registered to download JEDEC standards and documents may login to the site and visit "My Account" to review and manage their own personal profile.  Users experiencing difficulty should contact JEDEC for assistance.

JEDEC members may login to the protected members’ area, and may select to manage their profile from there. JEDEC members may also contact the JEDEC office for assistance with profile management. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

### How to Contact Us

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please email the JEDEC webmaster, [Arnaud Lebegue](https://web.archive.org/contact?category=Arnaud%20Lebegue,%20Sr.%20Web%20site%20Administrator).
