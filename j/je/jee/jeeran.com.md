**What information does jeeran.com collect, and how is it used?**

**A.** When you visit the jeeran.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, ip addresses, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with hundreds of thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. 

**B.** Our site uses temporary cookies to provide you with custom-tailored content. These cookies are automatically discarded once you close your browser and are not stored on your machine. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies but you will not be able to use many services on the site.

We collect all or some of this information on the pages where you create Your Account, and at other locations where you sign up for services. We use this information as follows: 

**1.** Setup your account on jeeran.com

2 **.** We use your mailing address not only to verify your identity but also to tell you about special offers, products, or events available to jeeran.com customers, that we think will interest you. When you create your account with jeeran.com, you are given the option of unchecking the email promotional updates box under General Subscriptions; if you do this, we will communicate with you only in relation to your account. You can change your preferences at any time, either by changing them in Your Account or by emailing us at [support@jeeran.com](mailto:support@jeeran.com)

**6.** If any Credit card information is taken, it issued to bill you for products you have ordered and to track sales. 

  
**With whom do we share information?**

We use the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All your ordering information -- including your name, address-- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security.

**Sweepstakes and Contests**    
jeeran.com hosts promotions and sweepstakes that may be sponsored and administered by outside parties. When you are entered in any sweepstakes or contest simply by purchasing a book, only your order number is given to the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest. When the winning entries are chosen, only the names and addresses of the winners are shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify the winners. When you enter a sweepstakes or contest through an email entry, your email entry is sent to the supplier house that we use to help gather entries for our sweepstakes and contests. When the winners have been selected, the winners’ email addresses may be shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes, so that they can be notified that they have won. When you enter a sweepstakes or contest through a mail-in entry, the information you provide on your entry is sent directly to the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest. 

No other information is shared by jeeran.com with third parties in connection with any sweepstakes or contest. To the extent that any privacy information relating to a sweepstakes or contest conflicts with the information provided here, the specific privacy information regarding the sweepstakes or contest will be clearly stated in an area that will be accessible to potential entrants and will govern that particular sweepstakes or contest. 

**Special Promotional Offers**    
From time to time jeeran.com would like to share with you special promotional offers from other companies, which have been specially screened by us. These offers would provide valuable savings to you. All jeeran.com customers will be given the opportunity to not receive these offers if they prefer, either by responding to the unsubscribe directions in any of these emails or by going to the Your Account page, then to Account Profile, and changing your general subscription preferences.
