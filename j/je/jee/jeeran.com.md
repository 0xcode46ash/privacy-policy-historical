New Customers: jeeran.com Privacy Policy**

At jeeran.com we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment for anyone who visits and purchases. As a seller of information-related products, we are also committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience as well as the best products. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you  


  * A complete description of what we collect 
  * How we use that information 
  * Whom we share that information with 
  * How you can change the information 
  * How you can tell us not to gather any information about you 

  
**What information does jeeran.com collect, and how is it used?**

**A.** When you visit the jeeran.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with hundreds of thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible. 

**B.** Our site uses cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don’t have to reenter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. You will still be able to order from jeeran.com using the Shopping Cart. 

**C.** When you create an account with us, enter sweepstakes or contests, participate in ar Chat, or sign up for services, you provide such personal information as: 

  * First and last name 
  * Billing address 
  * Shipping address(es) 
  * Email address 
  * Phone number 
  * Credit card account number 
  * Titles of items you purchase from us 
  * Messages you include in Gift Messages 
  * Product categories that interest you 

We collect all or some of this information on the pages where you create Your Account, and at other locations where you sign up for services. We use this information as follows: 

**1.** We fulfill your order based on this information. 

**2.** We provide you with information about your order (such as, whether your order has been received, processed, or shipped). 

**3.** If you participate in any of our Chats, you’ll be prompted to submit your name and where you’re from (for example, “Ali from Aqaba”) and your question, but no other information is formally stored in the archive of the chat. 

**4.** We ask for your phone number (but it’s not required) in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email. We save the information about products you purchased to provide you with the best possible customer service and the most up-to-date information about your order. 

**5.** We use your mailing address not only to verify your identity but also to tell you about special offers, products, or events available to jeeran.com customers, that we think will interest you. When you create your account with jeeran.com, you are given the option of unchecking the email promotional updates box under General Subscriptions; if you do this, we will communicate with you only in relation to your account. You can change your preferences at any time, either by changing them in Your Account or by emailing us at [webmaster@jeeran.com](mailto:webmaster@jeeran.com)

**6.** If any Credit card information is taken, it issued to bill you for products you have ordered and to track sales. 

  
**With whom do we share information?**

**Credit Card Processing and Security**    
Shopping with jeeran.com is absolutely safe -- you never have to worry about credit-card safety when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them. 

We use the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, we store it on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet. 

Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to call in your credit card information and complete your purchase by phone. 

**Sweepstakes and Contests**    
jeeran.com hosts promotions and sweepstakes that may be sponsored and administered by outside parties. When you are entered in any sweepstakes or contest simply by purchasing a book, only your order number is given to the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest. When the winning entries are chosen, only the names and addresses of the winners are shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify the winners. When you enter a sweepstakes or contest through an email entry, your email entry is sent to the supplier house that we use to help gather entries for our sweepstakes and contests. When the winners have been selected, the winners’ email addresses may be shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes, so that they can be notified that they have won. When you enter a sweepstakes or contest through a mail-in entry, the information you provide on your entry is sent directly to the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest. 

No other information is shared by jeeran.com with third parties in connection with any sweepstakes or contest. To the extent that any privacy information relating to a sweepstakes or contest conflicts with the information provided here, the specific privacy information regarding the sweepstakes or contest will be clearly stated in an area that will be accessible to potential entrants and will govern that particular sweepstakes or contest. 

**Special Promotional Offers**    
From time to time jeeran.com would like to share with you special promotional offers from other companies, which have been specially screened by us. These offers would provide valuable savings to you. All jeeran.com customers will be given the opportunity to not receive these offers if they prefer, either by responding to the unsubscribe directions in any of these emails or by going to the Your Account page, then to Account Profile, and changing your general subscription preferences. 

  
**How does jeeran.com protect the privacy of children younger than 13?**

jeeran.com does not knowingly collect any personal information from a child without the consent of the child's parent(s). Before signing up for a service that requests disclosure of personal information, children under 13 are advised to obtain parental consent. By participating in such a service, the user is representing that he or she is in compliance with this paragraph.
