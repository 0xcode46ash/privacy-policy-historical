# Jeteye :: Privacy Policy

At Jeteye Technologies, Inc. ("Jeteye"), we know that privacy is a paramount concern and we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. Jeteye does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. By visiting Jeteye.com, you are accepting the practices described in this policy.

## What Information About Users Does Jeteye Gather?

Information gathered online can generally be classified as either automatic or personally identifiable.

Automatic Information: Automatic information can include some limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a Web site: your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, operating system, the date and time of your query. This automatic information can help us refine and improve the quality of your online experience by facilitating the personalization of some services and a better understanding of how people interact with us. Like many Web sites, we use "cookies" that uniquely identify your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that we transfer through your Web browser to your computer's hard drive to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized features. The "help" function of most browsers allows you to disable cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Jeteye features or services may not function properly without cookies.

Information You Provide to Us: Some of our services require that you register for an account and provide personally identifiable information, which can include your name, address, zip code, etc. We will use that information to provide the service. For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we may request credit card or other payment information, which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. In order to ensure that you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us, when we require personally identifiable information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it.

## Does Jeteye Share the Information It Receives?

We do not rent, sell, or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals except in any of the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your consent.
  * We release account and other personally identifiable information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Jeteye, our users, or others. However, this does not include renting, selling, sharing, or disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
  * We may, from time to time, employ other companies or individuals for the sole purpose of processing and analyzing personally identifiable information on our behalf. These companies or individuals are subject to agreements that oblige them to process such information only in terms of our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.



If you register for an account, we may share the information you submit among all of our services in order to improve the quality of what we can offer you.

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with others, for example, the number of users who searched for a specific subject or how many users clicked a particular advertisement.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Jeteye, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to any pre-existing Privacy Policy, unless the customer consents otherwise. We will, however, provide you with a notice and the opportunity to change or remove your personally identifiable information before any data transfer occurs or before your personally identifiable information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Inviting a Friend

If a member elects to invite a friend to Jeteye's Web site, we request the friend's E-mail address. We will automatically send an E-mail inviting the friend to view and join Jeteye. In order to automatically add the respondent to the group list of the user sending the invitation and to send reminders about the invitation, Jeteye stores this E-mail address. However, we do not sell or share this E-mail address or use it to send any communication other than invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may [contact Jeteye](https://web.archive.org/contact.html) to request the removal of his/her E-mail from our databases.

## How Does Jeteye Secure Information?

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. 

Only employees who need to know your personally identifiable information in order to operate, develop, or improve services have access to that information.

## Search Results and Links

The sites displayed as search results from or links to Jeteye's services are developed and maintained by companies and individuals over which Jeteye exercises no control. These other sites may place cookies on your computer's hard drive, collect data, or solicit personal information.

Jeteye may format links in a way that enables us to determine whether or not they have been followed. We employ this information to develop and improve the quality of Jeteye's technology. For example, we may use this information to determine whether users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they follow links listed later in results.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy will change occasionally. You should check our Web site to see recent changes. We expect most changes to be minor, but more significant modifications may occur. In either case, we will post alterations on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Prior versions of this policy will be kept in an archive for you to view.
