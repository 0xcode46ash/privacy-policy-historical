# Privacy policy | JetRadar

**(Version 3 after 27/01/2012. If you disagree with any of the items below, please don’t use our web sites.)**

## Who we are

We (Go Travel Un Limited, a Hong Kong Limited Liability Company, and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as **Go Travel** ) operate a number of web sites allowing you to search for airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals: www.JetRadar.com, www.GoCheap.Travel (English). 

## What information we collect about you

Please be advised that we don’t knowingly collect any information about minors; however, if we find out that certain records belong to minors, we’ll go at great lengths to remove that information from our database ASAP. 

### Web site

  * We may install our own cookie (a small file) in your browser. This cookie allows us to determine:
    * Whether it’s your first visit or not, and
    * Whether you visited our site directly or via a link or search form published by one of our partners.
    * Your search history: origin, destination and travel dates.
  * We are using two web analytics systems: Google Analytics and InetLog. Both of them may install cookies in your browser according to their respective privacy policies.



### Email list

  * We collect your email address to send you the fare alerts you’ve subscribed to (IF you subscribed to them). You can unsubscribe at any time and you won’t receive any emails from us.



### Social networks

  * If you “LIKE”/”SHARE”/”+1” us (or perform a similar action) in social networks, we may obtain your first and last name. However, we’re not using this information for any purpose and choose to ignore it.



## What information we disclose about you

None, unless we are legally obliged (i.e. by court order or law enforcement agencies) to do so. Even then we will only be able to disclose the information explicitly outlined in the previous section. 

## What information we DON’T collect about you

### Personally identifiable information

  * We don’t need and hence don’t collect any of the following information about you: your name, age, email address (unless you subscribed to our email list), phone number, passport details, home address, etc.
  * All information in our systems is anonymized, which means that even we can’t match specific records to specific individuals.



### Order and payment information

  * Because you pay to an airline, hotel or travel agency directly, we have no visibility of your order information, including, but not limited to: specific ticket bought, price paid, credit card number, etc.
