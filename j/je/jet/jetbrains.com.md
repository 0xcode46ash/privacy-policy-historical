## Online Information Collection

#### IP Addresses

JetBrains uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our Websites, and to gather usage information. When you visit our site, we recognize only your domain name and not your email address. The only way we will ever obtain your email address is if you give it to us by filling out an online form or by sending us an email message.

#### Cookies

We use "cookies" on some (but not all) pages to deliver personalized content or to tailor our information offerings or responses according to the way you use the site, and/or your current context on the site. We do not use cookies to gather or transmit any personally identifiable information about you.

#### Data Protection

JetBrains takes precautions to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the information we collect via our Website. We employ the latest data security technologies including firewalls, encryption, password protection, intrusion monitoring, and other techniques to keep your information as safe as modern networking technology can make it.

#### Use of Email Addresses

If you choose to give us your email address, we will communicate with you via email. We will not share your email address with others outside JetBrains and its approved contractors and resellers. You can choose not to receive any more email at any time.

Depending on which email program you use and how it is configured, information about you may be sent automatically when you send us email. JetBrains has no control over this and recommends that you consult your system administrator if you have concerns about what information is being sent by your email program.

#### Online Surveys

We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position, tool use, etc.). If the online survey collects contact data such as your email address (although generally they do not), we will use those data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.

#### Links to Other Sites

The JetBrains Website contains links to other sites. JetBrains is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these linked Websites.

## Choice/Opt-Out

You can revoke your approval concerning the use of your personal information for marketing, promotional and business purposes specified in these terms and opt out of receiving email communications from JetBrains at any time.
