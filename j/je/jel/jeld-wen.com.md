# JELD-WEN Privacy Policy

  
**PRIVACY POLICY**

We at **JELD-WEN, inc.** (referred to as " **JELD-WEN, inc.** ," "we," "us," or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("Information") collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "Customers," "you," or "your"). This privacy statement discloses what Information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. At **JELD-WEN, inc.** , it is our intention to give you an understanding about how we collect your Information and the use we make of it in the course of our business.

To that end, we gather three types of Information about Customers: data that Customers provide through optional, voluntary registration on our sites; data collected and shared between JELD-WEN affiliates; and data we gather through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such Information enables us to tailor our content to fit Customers' needs better and to help our affiliates understand our audience. Be assured that **JELD-WEN, inc.** will not disclose Personal Information to third parties without your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when the Information is submitted.

Please note, if you provide us with your email address or phone number, we may choose to send you a follow-up email or phone call.

**Use of Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data generated by a Web site and stored on your computer. Our Sites may use cookies to track unique visits. This simply means that visits to the Site can be uniquely identified and tracked from page to page. However, it does not tell us who you are specifically, only that you are a unique visitor. Our Sites may also use cookies to keep visitors logged into secure areas as they navigate from page to page. This eliminates the need to log in multiple times during your visit. We may also use cookies to help our Sites remember the preferences or settings you may set in different Site functions. 

We do not have access to and cannot control cookies set by Web sites we link to or that link to our Sites.

**Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses**  
An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. 

**JELD-WEN, inc.** and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated Information to our affiliates, and to audit the use of our site. When Customers request pages from **JELD-WEN, inc.** and/or its affiliates' sites, our servers log the Customers' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Site terms of use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

We may also collect information provided by our affiliates and/or third parties. This information is generally non-personal information, relating to demographic traits and purchasing habits.
