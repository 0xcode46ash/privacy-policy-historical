We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order by email. When you return to the site and place another order, if you use your password or provide other personally identifiable information, we use this information to provide you with access to your customer and order information. We save the addresss(es) you provide for shipment, and when you place an order, we provide the address(es) to you as a selectable list for your convenience. We also ask you for personally identifiable information about other people to whom you are sending gifts. Jewelry Television™ uses this information only to ship your gifts, and, if you request it, to send each gift recipient an email notification of the gift.

Our site users can choose to electronically forward an item link to someone else by clicking “tell a friend.” The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.

If you grant us permission to use your information, we pledge to keep your personal information confidential. 

**Customer Care.** If you contact our Customer Care via phone, mail or email, Jewelry Television™ keeps a log of the information with your personal account to continue improving our service, follow-up on customer requests, and contact people who may be violating our policies.

**Cookies.** We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Jewelry Television™ uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

  2. **How does Jewelry Television™ use email?**

Jewelry Television™ does not share your email address with third parties for any commercial purpose. We send one email message to confirm each order you make, and we occasionally send you follow-up messages containing information specifically related to your order (such as shipping delays). Through our checkout procedure, Jewelry Television™ gives you the option to receive email notification on new features, specials and services. You may opt out of receiving these promotional emails by deleting the check mark next to the option to receive promotional emails found in the checkout procedure. 

You may contact our Customer Care by email at [CustomerCare@JewelryTelevision.com](mailto:CustomerCare@JewelryTelevision.com). We encourage your communications since we use your input to improve our site, products and services. Our Customer Care Representatives review and respond to every email that we receive. 

  3. **How does Jewelry Television™ protect its customer’s information?**

Jewelry Television™ is committed to online data security. Although total security does not exist on the Internet, Jewelry Television™ takes all reasonable steps to assure secure transmission and storage of your information. We protect transmission of information between your PC and our servers by utilizing industry standard efforts, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers provided by VeriSign™ encryption software. We store information relating to our customers on a high security server behind a firewall that is safeguarded from Internet access. 

While we use Secure Socket Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also have procedures to protect your information offline. All of your information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to use your information to perform a specific job (for example, billing clerks or Customer Care Representatives) are authorized to access personally identifiable information. 

As we continue to develop our business, we could buy or sell assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Jewelry Television™ or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. We will notify our customers if any of these situations occur. 

  4. **Does Jewelry Television™ protect email addresses?**

When you submit your email to Jewelry Television™, we protect it with the same high-security methods that we protect all personal information. 

  5. **What if I don’t want to send personal information over the Internet?** If you prefer to look for products on [JewelryTelevision.com](http://www.jewelrytelevision.com/) and order by phone, call us at **800-550-8393**. Any information you give Jewelry Television™, by telephone or the Internet, is stored on a secure server.

Television™’s Privacy Policy, you can email us at [CustomerCare@JewelryTelevision.com.](mailto:CustomerCare@JewelryTelevision.com.) Please be sure to include your email address so we can respond to your questions. In you prefer, call **800-550-8393** and a Customer Care Representative will take your call. **Or, you can write to: Jewelry Television™, Customer Care, 10001 Kingston Pike, Suite 57, Knoxville, Tennessee 37922.**
