This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.

**SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If we collect any personal information, we share and disclose such personal information only as described in this Policy (as amended from time to time).  We may share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Sites or performing any services on our behalf.  For example, we may use a third party to screen certain content before it is posted to the Sites.  In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider.  When you use these services, you are providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such party’s own privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.

We also may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the Company.

The Sites may contain links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of any Web site that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered the Sites through another Web site, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site before providing any personal information to that site. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.

**Online Communities**

The Sites may include certain online communities and other interactive features, such as user profiles, forums, message boards and chat rooms.  You may be asked to choose a user or member name and password in order to participate in certain features of the Services, which will be available to the general public while you participate in some features of the Services, such as the online communities.  Please do not use your real name.  Information you post in such public areas of the Sites is publicly available and may be viewed by and shared with other users. You can restrict user access to certain information through the privacy preferences setting on your account.  However, although we strive to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement these privacy preferences, no system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable.  You should always be cautious when giving out personal information to others in public online forums.  We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through the Sites (e.g. sending your contact information to another user through the chat service).  

**PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control.  Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.  To help protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.  You are responsible for all uses of the Sites by any person using your password.  Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused.

**CHOICE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**
