# Privacy Policy | Jesus Daily

## Privacy Policy

Jesus Daily has created this privacy policy to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. Jesus Daily does not sell, rent, trade, or share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties except as disclosed within this privacy policy.

## COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE

### Email Product or Petition to a Friend

If you choose to email a product description to a friend, we will ask you for your name and email address, and for your recipient’s name and email address. If you choose to send a petition description to a friend, only the friend’s email address is required. We will automatically send your chosen recipient(s) a one-time email to view the product or petition. Jesus Daily does not store, sell, trade or otherwise use any name or email address you share here for purposes other than to deliver your message.

### E-newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our e-newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send a periodic email to you. For some audio book downloads and giveaways, your email may be shared with the original publishing company. We provide unsubscribe options with each and every email sent in this manner. This is also summarized in the “Choice and Opt-out” section below.

### Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

## LINKS/SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS/ELECTRONIC LOG FILES/COOKIES/CLEAR GIFS/WEB BEACONS/RETARGETING

Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites, including sponsor sites and other philanthropic sites. Jesus Daily is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites and encourages you to review these companies’ privacy policies.

### Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, “Share this” button, and other interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Electronic Log Files

As is true of most sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in electronic log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use this information to understand how our websites are used to better meet the needs of our visitors and customers. We use IP address to identify and block malicious behavior like click fraud or denial of service attacks.

### Cookies

We use electronic cookies to recognize your computer as a returning visitor. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

For an enhanced site visitor experience, we may also use a cookie to store your click history. This would only be used to display your click history to you and is purely optional.

Third party ad servers and ad networks also use cookies to serve ads at the Jesus Daily Web site. For example, Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to Jesus Daily and other sites on the Internet. These third party ad servers automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. We have no access to or control over these third party cookies.

You may disable cookies from your browser’s configuration menu at any time. Information gathered by Jesus Daily cookies is considered personal and proprietary, and is encompassed in our commitment to your privacy and security of data.

Users may opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that helps us manage content on our site by letting us know which content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to personally identifiable information.

### Behavioral Targeting/Retargeting

Jesus Daily partners with a third party ad network to both display advertising on our own Web sites and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites in order to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests, and to provide you relevant advertising through retargeting when you leave our sites. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>, or by using the [NAI opt-out mechanism](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note that this does not opt you out of being served advertising — you will continue to see general ads that are not targeted to your interests.

Due to technological limitations at this time, Jesus Daily does not respond to browser Do Not Track signals.

Jesus Daily constantly uses aggregate and non-personally recognizable data about our customers both internally and using external providers, including Facebook and Google, to try to understand customer concerns and provide better products and promotions. We segment our data and email lists by issue area of concern, and also by type of product purchased, recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchase, which charitable gifts have been given, and other demographic and geographic data.

## Collection of Personal Information from Children

Jesus Daily does not knowingly collect individually identifiable information from or about children under 13. If Jesus Daily later learns that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13, we will take steps to remove that child’s information from our databases. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at info@jesusdaily.com.

### Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, you may contact us to amend, correct, or delete it. We will respond to your request within 1 business day. See below for our contact information.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Please contact us if you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Choice/Opt-out

We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive marketing material from us following your order, you can opt-out during the checkout process.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other promotional communications, please let us know by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each newsletter and communication, or by contacting us at:

Jesus Daily, LLC  
PO box 669  
Walkertown, NC 27051  
info@jesusdaily.com

You will be notified if your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider other than as specified in this policy, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. Although there are no plans to do this presently, if this ever occurs, an opt-out will be provided to you before any personally identifiable information is shared, so it is always your choice when information is provided to a third party.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by email prior to the change becoming effective.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 1, 2014.
