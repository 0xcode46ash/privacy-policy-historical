At Christianity.com we strive to bring you the most compelling Christian audio content available on the Internet. It is our goal to keep you, the listeners, completely satisfied with our site and what we have to offer. In order to keep up with the most current developments in the Christian community, we may occasionally need to disclose information about our listeners to select third-party vendors. Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we use the information we collect about you (collectively "Your Information").
