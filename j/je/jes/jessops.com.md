_Information Collection_  
Jessops is the sole owner of the information collected on www.jessops.com. Jessops collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

_Order_  
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

_Information Use_  
We use the following information in order to process your order from our e-commerce site:  
Full Name, including title, Address, Telephone or Fax numbers, Email Address.

More details of this can be found in our third party section, below.

_Member's Area_  
Membership of our "Member's Area" is optional, and membership is not essential to make a purchase.  
Customers who choose to join our Member's Area are subject to the same Privacy Policy as non-members. We may ask for additional information from users who sign up for the Member's Area, including an additional delivery address. We will not share this information with third parties, except for the purposes of fulfilling an order.  
We send update emails to our Members from time to time, to keep them up to date with product launches, promotions and site news. Members can opt-out of these emails at the time of registration, or by replying to the original email with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or by emailing webmaster@jessops.com.

_Cookies_  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. More information on cookies can be found here: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>

By setting a cookie on our site, the site can 'remember' who you are, if you are a "Member" of our "Member's Area". Persistent cookies enable the site to "remember" what you have in your trolley. No personal information is recorded in these cookies - only the contents of your trolley.

_Log Files_  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Webtrends that uses log files to analyze user movement.

_Legal Disclaimer_  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)_  
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, we may pass details to our suppliers of the number of users looking at/purchasing their products, or the number of click-throughs from their own sites. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

For the purpose of credit/debit card authorisation we will pass your name and address to our Bank.   
For the purpose of delivering your parcel we will pass your name and address to Parcelforce, or another of our parcel carriers.  
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

_Jessops Photo_  
We partner with a third party company “CEWE”, to provide “Jessops Photo” online printing service. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these servies. . If the customer places an order using the "Jessops Photo" service then payment will be taken by CEWE. CEWE are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing the "Jessops Photo" service. Customer wishing to opt-out of emails and online marketing promotions may do so from the Jessops Photo website. 

_Business Transitions_  
In the event Jessops goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

_Choice/Opt-out_  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

User of the Jessops Photo may opt-out of email newsletters via the Jessops Photo website.

_Links_  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Jessops, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

_Surveys & Contests_  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postcode). Contact information will be used and may be shared with the contest/survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

_Send Wishlist Facility_  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site/products on our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Jessops does not store this information, which is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

_Security_  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. This uses 128 bit encryption, the highest currently commercially available.

While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Web Sales or Dispatch teams) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to webmaster@jessops.com

_Supplementation of Information_  
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

_Address Verification_  
We use AFD software to verify a user's address to gain authorisation for sales charged to their credit/debit card.

_Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information_  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at webmaster@jessops.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the bottom of this page.

_Notification of Changes_  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
