When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these servies.

CEWE are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing the "Jessops Photo" service. Customer wishing to opt-out of emails and online marketing promotions may do so from the Jessops Photo website.

_Business Transitions_  
In the event Jessops goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

_Choice/Opt-out_  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

User of the Jessops Photo may opt-out of email newsletters via the Jessops Photo website.

_Links_  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Jessops, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

_Surveys & Contests_  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postcode). Contact information will be used and may be shared with the contest/survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

_Send Wishlist Facility_  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site/products on our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Jessops does not store this information, which is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

_Security_  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. This uses 128 bit encryption, the highest currently commercially available.

While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Web Sales or Dispatch teams) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [webmaster@jessops.com](mailto:webmaster@jessops.com).

_Supplementation of Information_  
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

_Address Verification_  
We use AFD software to verify a user's address to gain authorisation for sales charged to their credit/debit card.

_Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information_  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at [cs@jessops.com](mailto:cs@jessops.com). Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the bottom of this page.

_Notification of Changes_  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
