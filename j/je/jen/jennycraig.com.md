# JennyCraig.com Privacy Policy

### Jenny Craig Privacy Privacy

**GENERAL**  
Many of the ways in which you interact with the Jenny Craig Web site (the “Site”) allow us to learn about you. We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. In most instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information about you. 

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, you have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal it to us. Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you fill out the registration page, send us feedback, or post in our chat rooms or message boards. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

**HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**   
We do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate our site, enhance our Site, and sell and deliver advertising. We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties. 

Some online activities you choose to do necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties. In some situations, we share your personally identifiable information with third parties that provide services to our Site in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of our Site. In some cases we use your personally identifiable information to provide information to you, such as to send newsletters to you that you request.

**COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING METHODS  
**Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses, for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can also help us to tailor our Site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly if you do.

**OTHER SITES**  
Please note that if you provide any information on your own to parties who provide service to us or to any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.

**LIMITS ON OUR ABILITIES  
** Although your privacy is important to us, we cannot ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and by use of our Site you authorize us to) disclose information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our discretion or as may be required under law, believe necessary or appropriate.

**SECURITY  
** We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Jenny Craig encourages you to learn as much as you can about your privacy on the Internet.

**CHANGES  
** We may change, move, or delete portions of, or may add to, our Site from time to time and without notice. Your use of our Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the terms as changed.
