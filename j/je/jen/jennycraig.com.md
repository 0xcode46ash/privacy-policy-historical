# Jenny Craig Privacy Policy

**GENERAL**  
Many of the ways in which you interact with the Jenny Craig Web site (the "Site") allow us to learn about you. We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular. In most instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information about you. 

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, you have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal it to us. Some examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include (but may not be limited to) when you fill out the registration page, send us feedback, or post in our chat rooms or message boards. Personally identifiable information you may choose to provide include your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, other information such as your current weight and goal weight, or a credit card number, provided in association with other personally identifiable information. If you do not provide all "required" information, however, some portions of our site will not work properly for you, or you may be denied access to certain sections of the Web site. 

In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.
