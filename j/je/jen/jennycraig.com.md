# Privacy | Jenny Craig

## General

Many of the ways in which you interact with the Jenny Craig Web site ([www.jennycraig.com](http://www.jennycraig.com/) and [www.jennycraig.ca](http://www.jennycraig.ca/)) (each, a “Site”) and the Jenny Craig mobile app (the “App”) allow us to learn about you. This Privacy Statement describes the type of information we collect from you when you visit our Site or use our App and explains how Jenny Craig may use and disclose such information, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it.

## INFORMATION COLLECTION

### Information You Provide

Jenny Craig collects information from you when you choose to share it with us to use our Site or App, create an online account with us, request information from us, sign up for newsletters or our email list, post in our chat rooms or message boards, or otherwise contact us. The information we collect may include your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photo/image, gender, date of birth, health information such as your current weight and goal weight, food consumption, and measurements, and, if you are a Jenny Craig customer, a credit/debit card number or other financial information. You have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal personally identifiable information to us. If you do not provide all “required” information, however, some portions of our Site or App will not work properly for you, or you will not be able to register or access certain sections of the Site. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint. 

We may combine the information you provide to us with information (1) from and about you that we automatically collect when you use Jenny Craig’s Sites or App, (2) we collect when you visit a Jenny Craig Center, or (3) from other online and offline sources in an effort to provide you with a seamless experience, better serve your needs, and provide you with content and advertising that is more relevant to your interests.

### Information Automatically Collected

We may use cookies, web beacons, log files, or other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to and users of our Sites and App, to deliver online advertisements that we think would be more relevant to your interests, and to monitor interactions with our emails and online advertisements. For example, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed the Site or App. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Site or App, the areas or pages of the Site or App that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the Site or App, the number of times you return to the Site, other click-stream or Site or App usage data, and emails or ads that you open, forward or click-through to our Site or App.

We may also use third party advertisements to support our Sites and App. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, or log files when they advertise on our Sites or App, which may send these advertisers information, including your non-personal information.

### Cookies and Other Tracking Methods

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your hard drive when you visit our Site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses or other tracking tools, for a number of reasons. For example, these tools may (a) allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it; (b) help us to tailor our Site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests; and (c) allow us to better understand how you and others use our Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are the most popular. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly if you do. Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

When you enter sensitive personal information (such as credit card information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL).

Service Providers will have access to your information needed to perform their business functions, but may not use or share that information for other purposes.
