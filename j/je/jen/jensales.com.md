Jensales is very concerned with the protection of online privacy for all of our website visitors. Although we track the total number of visitors to our site to allow us to update and improve our site, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. Any "cookie" technology (where our server deposits a special code on a visitor's computer) will only be used to track non-personal information, such as type of browser, operating system and domain names for the purpose of improving our visitors' online experience.

Jensales only collects personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor in one of our online order and e-mail correspondence forms.

Jensales does not sell or release any information gathered on our website to any third parties. All information gathered online will be used only by Jensales for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services and websites.

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy.
