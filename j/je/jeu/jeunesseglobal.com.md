Jeunesse Global is committed to respecting your privacy. We've structured our Web site so that, in
general, you can visit Jeunesse Global on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal
information. Once you choose to provide us Personally Identifiable Information (any information by
which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer
relationship with Jeunesse Global .
This statement regarding the privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide online

Awareness. Jeunesse Global provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy
policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and
used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of
every page on our Web site.
What we collect. Upon logging onto our Web server, our Web server automatically recognizes your
domain name, but not your email address (where possible). We will collect the domain name from
which you log on, aggregate information on what pages you access or visit, user‚Äêspecific information on
what pages you access or visit, and information volunteered by you (such as survey information and/or
site registrations).
We do collect "cookies" to store your preferences and record session information.
On parts of the Jeunesse Global Web site, you can become a member/customer and/or ISR, order
products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information
that may be collected on these pages are name, customer number, contact and billing information,
transaction and credit card information.
In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and
services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or
professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences.
How we use it. Jeunesse Global uses your information to better understand your needs and provide
you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to
communicate back to you, to update you on services and benefits, and to personalize our Web sites for
you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide
you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always
give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We


will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact,
where applicable. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you
enroll with Jeunesse Global .
Whom we share it with. Jeunesse Global will not sell, rent or lease your Personally Identifiable
Information to others unless we have your explicit permission or are required by law. We will only share
the personal data you provide online with other Jeunesse Global entities and/or business partners who
are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Jeunesse Global entities and/or business
partners, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy
policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality
agreements.
Choice. Jeunesse Global will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information provided to us
online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a
choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish
to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor
such requests.
Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that
are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.
Accuracy & Access. Jeunesse Global strives to keep your Personally Identifiable Information accurate
and secure. We do not provide access to your information online. In order to update or correct your
information with Jeunesse Global , it will be necessary for you to contact Jeunesse Global directly

Security. Jeunesse Global is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent
unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of
information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to
safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Future Developments. From time to time, we may use customer and/or Jeunesse Global information
for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices
change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these
changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how
your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. We will only use data
collected after a policy has changed for the new purposes.
