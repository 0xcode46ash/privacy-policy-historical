# Jeunesse Global Privacy Policy

Jeunesse Global Privacy Policy
Any communication or material you provide to us, whether received online, electronically,
otherwise collected by or submitted to us, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions
or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary except as set forth in
this Privacy Policy. Anything you transmit or post becomes our property and may be used for
any Jeunesse Global business purpose, including, but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure,
transmission, publication, market, research, development of prospect lists, project planning,
broadcast, posting and marketing, among other things.
Jeunesse Global is committed to respecting your privacy. We have structured our Website so
that, in general, you can visit Jeunesse Global on the Web without identifying yourself or
revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us Personally Identifiable
Information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will
only be used to support your business relationship with Jeunesse Global and Jeunesse Global’s
business.
This Privacy Policy covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Accuracy and Access, Security,
and Future Developments.
Awareness. Jeunesse Global provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy
policies and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is
collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and
from the bottom of every page on our Website.
What we collect. Upon logging onto our Web server, our Web server automatically recognizes
your domain name, but not your email address (where possible). We will collect the domain
name from which you log on, aggregate information on what pages you access or visit, user-
specific information on what pages you access or visit, and information volunteered by you (such
as survey information and/or site registrations).
To help us tailor the Website to the needs and interests of its visitors, we may collect various
types of information from you that do not identify you personally, such as the products you
purchase, the services you use, the frequency of such purchase and uses, the type of browser you
are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g.,
Windows XP or Mac OS X), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast,
Earthlink), the length of time you spend on the Website, which pages you visited within the
Website, which site you visited before coming to the Website, and which site you accessed when
you left the Website (collectively, “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). “Collected
Information” means Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable
Information collectively.
We do collect "cookies" to store your preferences and record session information.
On parts of the Jeunesse Global Website, you can become a member/customer and/or distributor,
order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of
Personally Identifiable Information that may be collected on these pages include name, customer


number, contact and billing information, and transaction and credit card information.
In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products
and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your
personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact
preferences.
How we use it. Jeunesse Global uses your information to better understand your needs and
provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a
transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on services and benefits, and to
personalize our Website for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and
are not retained for other purposes.
We may use the Personally Identifiable Information (a) to protect and defend its rights or
properties, (b) to protect your personal safety and the personal safety of its users and the public
in general (whether in emergency situations or otherwise), (c) to provide to third parties to
maintain and/or operate the Website, (d) to give to its business partners and third party vendors
that provide services or products selected by you, (e) to fulfill your requests and product or
service orders, (f) to provide you with information on products, specials, newsletters, and other
services we provide, (g) for marketing research, (h) to enforce the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, (i) if you are a distributor of the Company, to enforce the
terms of your Jeunesse Agreement and the Policies & Procedure and in connection with our
business relationship as set forth in such documents, and (j) as otherwise permitted by law.
We aggregate the Non-Personally Identifiable Information with information collected from other
visitors of the Website to track overall visitor traffic patterns. This aggregated information
allows us to develop statistics that are helpful to understanding how its visitors use the Website.
We use this aggregated information to monitor, maintain, and improve the functionality and
content of the Website, making it more responsive to the needs of our visitors. We may also use
the Non-Personally Identifiable Information for the enhancement, operation, management or
maintenance of the Website, in connection with developing and operating new websites and for
historical, statistical, scientific, or other purposes. We reserve the right to use, sell, and assign
for any and all purposes all Non-Personally Identifiable Information; and you authorize us to use,
sell, and assign, for any and all purposes, all Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
We may disclose Collected Information in response to legal process, for example, in response to
a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law
enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise
required by law.
From time to time we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to
provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum
we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market
research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before


receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Data collected online may also be combined
with information you provide when you enroll with Jeunesse Global.
Whom we share it with. We will only share Personally Identifiable Information with other
Jeunesse Global entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses
described above. Such Jeunesse Global entities and/or business partners, including those in the
United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the
use of this data and are bound by appropriate confidentiality agreements.
Choice. Jeunesse Global will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information provided
to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and
offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us
know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do
everything we can to honor such requests.
Your permission is always secured first should we ever share your information with third parties
that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.
Accuracy & Access. Jeunesse Global strives to keep your Personally Identifiable Information
accurate and secure. In order to update or correct your information with Jeunesse Global, it will
be necessary for you to contact Jeunesse Global directly through the methods listed below. To
protect your privacy and security, upon contacting us we will also take reasonable steps to verify
your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.
Security. Jeunesse Global is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To
prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate
use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We place a priority on
protecting your Personally Identifiable Information and take commercially reasonable measures
to secure and protect such information. However, we cannot guarantee that any electronic
commerce is totally secure. For example, we have no control over the information collected by
your Internet service provider or your employer (if the Website is made available to you through
your employer or if you send us Personally Identifiable Information through your employer-
provided email account) or information that you disclose in a public forum. Any such third party
that collects your Personally Identifiable Information may use the information in accordance
with its terms and conditions of use (and related privacy policies), which may be different from
this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for any information collected by such third parties
and/or how such information is used or maintained. Neither any third party nor we have the
authority to make any representations or commitments on behalf of the other.
Future Developments. From time to time, we may use customer and/or Jeunesse Global
information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our
information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the Policy changes to our
Website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new
uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our


Website periodically. We will only use data collected after a policy has changed for the new
purposes.
Collection of Information by Third Party Sites
The Website may contain links to other Internet sites. These other sites may have different
privacy policies and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such other sites.
Children’s Policy
The Website is not intended for use by children, and children under the age of 13 are not
authorized to use the Website and should not submit any personal information to us. We do not
knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13.
Business Transactions
We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we
otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the Website, including Collected Information,
to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business.
In the event we enter a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or
sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Collected Information may be among the assets
transferred.
By using the Website you acknowledge acceptance of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of
use. This Privacy Policy was last revised on February 12, 2015.
