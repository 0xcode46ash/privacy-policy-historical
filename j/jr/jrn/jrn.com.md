# Privacy - Journal Communications, Inc.

[ JOURNAL COMMUNICATIONS](http://www.journalcommunications.com/):Â 

At the same time that Journal Communications, Inc. is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using personally identifiable information and your reasonable expectations of privacy.

**What personally identifiable information do I provide via JC.com?**

Journal Communications, Inc., may, from time to time, ask you to provide various types of personally identifiable information to enhance your experience on our site. During registration, Journal Communications, Inc. may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, Zip code, and country, and other optional information. Whenever you provide personally identifiable information to us, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy. See below about "cookies" and what other information is collected.

**How does JC.com use my personally identifiable information?**

Our primary goal, should we collect personally identifiable information, is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our site. Journal Communications, Inc. may use the personally identifiable information you provide to us in several ways. Some examples follow.

A user's personally identifiable information may be used by Journal Communications, Inc. to contact you as part of an online survey. We may also use the information provided by you to contact you with legal notices, or to advise you of any material changes in our terms and conditions.

**Do other companies or people have access to personally identifiable information I provide to Journal Communications, Inc.?**

Should you be on an area of JC.com and be asked for personally identifiable information, you are providing that information to Journal Communications, Inc., its divisions or affiliates, or vendors providing contractual services for Journal Communications, Inc. (such as hosting vendors and list managers). If personally identifiable information is being provided to and/or maintained by any company other than these, our policy is that we will not transfer that personally identifiable information unless notice is given prior to transfer. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or by expressing this preference, if requested. Additional information about personally identifiable information follows.

We do not control the privacy policies of external sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access. Please visit the sites of these businesses to review their privacy policies.

Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, a user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside Journal Communications, Inc., its divisions or affiliates, or its service vendors unless notice is given at the time of collection or prior to transfer. Journal Communications, Inc. may also disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our User Agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Journal Communications, Inc.'s rights or property, other JC.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

**Data Security.** We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

**What information do web servers collect**?

Web servers serving JC.com automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors. This information may be used for various purposes including internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors, and for traffic audits.

**What are cookies and how does JC.com use them?**

JC.com may place a "cookie" on the browser of a JC.com user's computer to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we may also use the information to measure certain traffic patterns. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by JC.com by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this could disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by JC.com.

**Special Message for those under 13**

Children under 13 should NOT send any information about themselves to us - including information like name, address or e-mail address. In general, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If, in limited circumstances, we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.
