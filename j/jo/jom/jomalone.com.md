We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. 

      **Information We Collect by Automated Means**

When you visit this site, we collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons. 

                                     _Technologies We Use_

  
_Cookies, Web Server Logs and Web Beacons_

Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our website. 

In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web servers may log details such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your device is located.  The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that linked you to our site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. 

To control which web servers collect this information, we may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons.”  These are computer instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. 

  


_Third Party Web Analytics Services_

We may use third party web analytics services on this site, our social media platforms, or our social networking or mobile applications, such as those of Adobe Site Catalyst, Coremetrics and/or Google Analytics.  The service providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze how visitors use the site.  The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the website.  You may deactivate the ability of these analytics services to analyze your browsing activities on this site.   To exercise your choice with respect to their collection of information on this site:

  * For Adobe Site Catalyst, please [click here](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html);
  * For Coremetrics, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/customer_service/coremetrics_optout.tmpl);
  * To disable the Google Analytics cookie and any other third party web analytics service provider cookies, some browsers indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis.



                                     _Targeted Advertising_

We also may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons on our websites and on third-party websites.  They use this information to provide advertisements about our products and services tailored to your interests (including for companies not affiliated with us).  You may see these advertisements on other websites.  This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn more about these and other advertising networks and their opt-out instructions, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

                                      _How We Use the Information Collected by Automated Means_

We may use the information collected through automated means on this site for market research, data analytics and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you’ve visited us before or are new to the site, and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including compliance with relevant industry standards and the enforcement of our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-conditions).  We also may use the information in other ways for which specific notice is provided at the time of collection. 

                                      _California Do Not Track Notice_

Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our customers’ personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us.

California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operator’s website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our site such as a social feature, analytics service, or an advertising network partner, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information. We do not knowingly permit such third parties to collect any personal information from our site unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.

**_Information We Share_**

We do not rent lists, or sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described here. We may share your personal information with:

  *   Our affiliates within the **Jo Malone Inc.** umbrella of companies
  *   Service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Examples of these service providers include entities that process credit card payments, fulfill orders, and provide web hosting and marketing services.
  *   Other third parties with your consent (e.g., some of our Facebook applications may share information collected through those apps with your Facebook friends or other Facebook users).



In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

_**Your Rights and Choices**_
