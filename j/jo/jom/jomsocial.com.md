# Privacy Policy

Jom Social’s Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Jom Social anytime you interact with Jom Social, such as when you visit our website, when you purchase Jom Social products and services, or when you call our sales or support associates. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Jom Social, and we go to great lengths to protect it.

 **Within the Jom Social Group**

To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Jom Social group globally who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with Jom Social’s privacy policy.

 **With our service providers, vendors, and strategic partners**

There are also times when it may be advantageous for Jom Social to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Jom Social has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Jom Social to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Jom Social’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Jom Social and its carrier to exchange the information that you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Jom Social and its carrier’s respective privacy policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Jom Social website.

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

 **How we protect your personal information**

Jom Social takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The Jom Social Online Store and iTunes Store use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the Jom Social Online Store or iTunes Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.

You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari.

 **Integrity of your personal information**

Jom Social has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking at www.jomsocial.com/contact/myinfo. And you can request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your interactions with our sales and support agents by contacting us at the email address below.

 **Kids**

Jom Social recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Jom Social purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Jom Social and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

 **Cookies and other technologies**

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Jom Social’s website uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services, such as iTunes. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.

For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you with a greeting the next time you visit the Jom Social Store. Information such as your country and language — and if you’re an educator, your school — helps us provide a more useful online shopping experience. And your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer helps us register your products, personalize Mac OS X, and set up your MobileMe service and provide you with customer service.

If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, please go to www.jomsocial.com/legal/cookies/, which explains step by step how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Jom Social website will not be available once cookies are disabled.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Jom Social will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.

In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Jom Social website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

In addition we use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.

Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer. 

**Our companywide commitment to your privacy**

As we said, Jom Social takes protecting your privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate these guidelines to Jom Social employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company. In addition, Jom Social supports industry initiatives to preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce.
