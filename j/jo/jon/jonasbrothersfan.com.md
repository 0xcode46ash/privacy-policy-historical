# Privacy Policy | Fanlala.com

Fanlala.com ("Fanlala") is the ultimate fan community for teens! Fanlala is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.

## What information is collect and how it is used?

The following section describes the information we collect from you and indicates the primary purposes why we collect each type of information from you. If we use your information or disclose or distribute your information to third parties for a purpose that is not related to the following purposes, we will notify you by email of your right to opt-out of that use, disclosure or distribution beforehand. Your right to opt-out shall be governed by the Choice/Opt-Out Section below.

As described below in more detail, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is or may be used to help identify you, to track activity within our site and to gather broad demographic information. Our Web server will collect IP information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your session ID. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.

Our site's registration and order form requires users to give us the following:

  * contact information (such as email address), and
  * demographic information (such as date of birth).



The user's contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings as set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out section below.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our Web site. We use this data to tailor the user's experience at our Web site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

The demographic information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Aggregate basis means that your information will be generalized with the data we collect from all our users. For example, we may share the average age or income level of our users with advertisers. We will not share personally identifiable information, such as contact information, unique identifiers, financial information and demographic information, with advertisers about any particular individual that uses our Web site.

Fanlala may also use the information we collect from you to optimize our Web site so that it is more beneficial to users like yourself and to us. This site contains links to other sites. Fanlala is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

All of this collected information is described generally in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Information."

**Children's Personal Information.** Fanlala may collect Personal Information from children under 13. Some of this Personal Information is collected actively: that is, we ask for information and the person asked provides the information, for instance by typing it into a form. In other cases, the Personal Information is collected passively, by, for instance, the use of cookies. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age. This policy describes our practices with respect to information we collect from you, as well as from your child. Parents of children that sign up for an account under 13 years of age are notified via email that their child has signed up for an account and are prompted to approve or delete the account. For more information on the type of Personal Information collected, and the uses to which Fanlala puts this Personal Information, please visit the section of this Privacy Policy headed "Personal Information".

## Security and protection of information we collect

Information we collect is stored in a secure data facility, and is only available to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.

We take additional reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information we collect. For example, all personal information is password protected. Additionally, certain data, such as financial information, is collected via a SSL connection. However, no information collected over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. If we become aware of a security breach that may affect your personal information, we will notify you via the email address you provide.

If you have any questions or concerns about how Fanlala secures personal information, contactÂ [privacy@fanlala.com](mailto:privacy@fanlala.com).

## Information we share

Fanlala is not in the business of renting and selling personal information to any entity outside of Fanlala websites. Fanlala will share your and your child's personal information under the following circumstances:

  * To comply with a subpoena, court order, or other legal proceeding, or if otherwise requested by a legitimate law enforcement body to cooperate in their investigations. 
  * To prevent, investigate, or to take some other action against illegal activities, potential fraud, potential physical threats to any person, violations of our terms of service, or in any other way as required by law. 
  * If we sell all or part of our business, personal information may be disclosed as part of the sale or transfer of the business assets. Entities we sell or transfer these assets to will be bound by this privacy policy.
