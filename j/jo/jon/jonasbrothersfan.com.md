There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by FanGap and/or our service providers. This information can include: your computer’s IP address, browser type, domain names from which you are visiting, access times and referring web site addresses.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through public message boards or other areas of the Sites that are viewable by other visitors and users, this information may be collected and used by others.   We strongly discourage you from sharing any personal, financial or other sensitive information. 

FanGap encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from our Sites so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. FanGap is not responsible for the privacy statements on third party Web sites, which may differ from our policies and practices.  Some of the advertisements that may appear on the Sites may also be delivered to you by third party advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect information about your visit to or use of our Sites, including information about the ads they display, via cookies. 

Use of your Personal Information 

FanGap collects and uses your personal information to operate the Sites, to contact you and process your registration, to facilitate your use of our Sites, for our recordkeeping purposes and to deliver the services you have requested. We may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from FanGap and our affiliates. We may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. 

FanGap may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is generally not transferred to the third party. In some cases, we may share information we collect (including personal information or anonymous demographic information) with third party companies who offer products or services in which we believe you may be interested.  In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

FanGap keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within the Sites in order to determine what Sites, pages and services are the most popular.

Use of Cookies 

The Sites use "cookies" to help us recognize you and to personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize a page on one or more of our Sites, or register with FanGap, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as your name, billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same FanGap Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sites you visit. 

Security of your Personal Information 

FanGap employs administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  Please be aware, however, that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

Changes to this Statement 

FanGap may occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company practices and customer feedback; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a new Privacy Statement here and changing the effective date above.  Therefore, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of any changes.
