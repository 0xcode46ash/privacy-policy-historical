The privacy of visitors to johnbokma.com is important to me. 

I recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information I receive and collect when you use visit johnbokma.com, and how I safeguard your information.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

Currently I use third party advertisements (AdSense) on johnbokma.com to support my site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on my site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
