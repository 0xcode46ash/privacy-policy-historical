# Privacy policy - Jotti's malware scan

The following discloses our privacy policy for Jotti's malware scan. We recognise that privacy is important and we want you to completely understand what happens with the information you send to us.

Our service is designed to be used anonymously. We are not interested in names, addresses, or other information providing insight into the identities of our visitors.

We log information you voluntarily provide us with. As you may or may not be aware, web browsers (e.g. Firefox or Internet Explorer) provide certain information to every website you visit, such as your current IP address, operating system (e.g. Windows), as well as the URL of the website you came from. As far as we use this information, it is handled anonymously. For example, we do not track which browser a specific visitor uses, but we may index how many of our visitors use Internet Explorer or chart how many of our users visit our service from France.  
We use IP addresses to respond to abuse. If we have reason to believe somebody is willingly abusing the service or using it for criminal purposes, we will file abuse reports with the Internet Service Provider associated with that IP address.  
With the obvious exception of filing abuse reports, the information mentioned in this paragraph is not shared with other parties, unless such should be ordered by a court of law.

We use cookies - small files containing short texts - to store preferences on your computer. We use these preferences for your convenience; for example, we store which language you last chose to display our website in and use that information to display webpages in that language the next time you visit. We do not use these cookies to identify computers or individuals or companies.

We (temporarily) store files you send in for scanning and share these with anti-malware companies. We do this for one simple reason: to help anti-malware companies improve detection accuracy in their security products. We treat your files confidentially (we have better things to do than reading thousands of files each day) and although we trust the participating anti-malware companies receiving your files will do the same, we cannot exercise control over the actions these anti-malware companies take. Your files will probably be analysed (and thus read) by security analysts. If you do not want other people or companies reading your files, please do not send these files in for scanning. The period of time submitted files are retained depends on the amount of submissions and the number of anti-malware companies detecting the samples. Files are not shared with entities outside the anti-virus/security industry.

Our advertisers may collect information you voluntarily provide them with (such as browser, operating system and IP addresses, not including your name, address and phone number, but also your visits to particular websites) and use this information to provide you with targeted ads. For example, if your current IP address originates from Finland, our advertisers may present you with Finnish ads or ads about current events in Finland; or if you have been known to visit a lot of websites about tennis, you may encounter ads about professional tennis equipment.

In a nutshell: we are not spying on you, we are not unreasonable, we have no desire to find out who you are, and we do nothing else that we would not want done to ourselves. We only store and use broad statistical data, not connected or traceable to a living person or a company, and the files you send in for scanning, to be reviewed by security analysts in order to improve detection accuracy in their anti-malware products.
