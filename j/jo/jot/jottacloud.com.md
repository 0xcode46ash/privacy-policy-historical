#### The Information We Collect

#### Information You Provide

When you register with Jotta, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your gender, and any other personal information that you provide to us.

Passwords are encrypted in our databases. We cannot read your password. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

You acknowledge and agree that Jottacloud may occasionally send you communications regarding your account or the Service via email.

#### Website Use Information

When you enter Jotta, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Jottacloud visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser.

Jottacloud automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.

We use persistent cookies to store website usage information. Persistant cookies are stored on your computer for a longer period of time. Such information is not personally identifiable.

#### Backing Up Data

When backing data up with Jotta, you send us that data and you also send file system information, including names of files and directories. Jottacloud may also record your IP address when you submit information. Files are encrypted with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) during transfer.

#### How We Use The Information

 

  * We use information which we collect for purposes of providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers.
  * We will not sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of registered Users to third parties.
  * We will not view the files that you backup using the Service.
  * We may view your file system information (file extensions, sizes etc. but not your file contents) to provide technical support.
  * We may share certain types of non-personal identifiable information such as average number of files for all users.
