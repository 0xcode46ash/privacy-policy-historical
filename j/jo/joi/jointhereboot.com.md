# Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy explains what Reboot Holdings Pty Ltd and its affiliated entities (collectively, “Reboot”, “we” or “us”) do with the personal information that is collected from the users of our website currently located at http://www.jointhereboot.com (our “Site”) and via the services we provide in connection with our Site. Reboot may change its policy from time to time, so it is suggested that you check the Site from time to time to ensure that you know about our current policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us via our [Contact Page](http://jointhereboot.com/contact/).

Our Site contains links to other sites. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that Reboot is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit through a link or advertisement on our Site or through a service provided by Reboot.

CHILDREN

While our Site is intended for a general audience, our Site is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Our Site collects information from users in a number of different ways. Any time you use our Site, some basic, general information is collected. This general information is used internally in connection with our business to improve our Site, including our marketing and advertising efforts.

When you set up an account on our Site, we collect additional personally identifiable information provided by you that may include your: (i) first and last name; (ii) address; (iii) email address; (iv) phone number; and (v) browsing and activity patterns. When you order a product directly from us, and not one of our partners (such as Amazon.com), we may also collect credit card and other billing information.

Additionally, when you register for a Reboot program, we may also collect personally identifiable health information voluntarily provided by you. Please note that while we will work to maintain the privacy of any personally identifiable health information that you may provide us, Reboot is not subject to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or any other laws applicable to medical professionals and health care providers (or other “covered entities”).

HOW REBOOT USES AND SHARES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

While we are committed to maintain the privacy of your billing information and personally identifiable health information, we may share or sell any of your other personal information for any legally permissible purpose at our discretion, including, but not limited to those described in this Privacy Policy. 

Reboot may specifically disclose the personal information that you provide us in the following circumstances:

1\. Reboot may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.

2\. Reboot might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate via bankruptcy its business. If so, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets, although we may retain a copy of your information.

3\. We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Reboot, our users, or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party, we will use reasonable attempts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.

SHARING OF GENERAL OR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Reboot will from time to time share aggregated, general or demographic information we collect about our users and their use of our Site with our partners and advertisers in a manner which does not identify any individual user. We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders placed on our Site and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services purchased on our Site. Such companies will not retain, share, store or use any of our user’s personal information for any secondary purposes. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services that are available on our Site. When a user signs up for these services, we will share the user’s name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services to the user, but these parties will not be allowed to use such personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.

OUR COMMUNITY AREAS

Our Site features community areas and other public forums where users can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for others, including Reboot and our team, to answer. Our communities and forums are open to the public and should not be considered private.

Any information shared in any online community area or other public forum is by design open to the public and is not private. Please think carefully before posting any personally identifiable information, especially health-related information, in any public forum. What you post may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict. As with any public forum on any website, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.
