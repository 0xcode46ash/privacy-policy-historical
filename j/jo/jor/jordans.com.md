Data from in-store security cameras may also be provided to law enforcement upon written request.

### Your Choice: Marketing Preferences

We want to communicate with you in ways you find useful. Examples are special offers and new product announcements. We use the following standards for marketing communications: 

>   * We use an opt-out standard for phone, text, e-mail, and direct mail messages. This means we will conduct the activity unless you tell us not to. We also use an opt-out standard for sharing information with third parties for marketing purposes. 
> 


You can provide us your marketing preferences by visiting the Privacy Preference Center. The Preference Center enables you to update or change your preferences about receiving marketing materials at any time. Please allow sufficient time for your preferences to be processed. It may take up to 10 days to process your requests. 

Please be aware that, even if you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional purposes. Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls. We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order, such as regarding order status, shipment, or refunds. 

### Credit offerings

The above marketing preferences do not apply to our credit card offerings since these are provided through our financial institution partner(s). However, you can choose to stop receiving prescreened offers of credit from all companies, including our prescreened offers, by calling 1-888-567-8688 or by going to [www.optoutprescreen.com](http://www.optoutprescreen.com/).

### Online Operations and Advertising

You may exercise choices related to our online operations and advertising. For instance, you can choose to browse our Web site without accepting cookies. Please know that cookies enable us to recognize you from page to page, and they support your transactions with us. Without cookies enabled, you will still be able to browse our Web site, but will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain Web site features.

### How We Secure Your Information

Securing your information is a company priority. Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information. When we do have to collect your most private, personal information, such as social security numbers, we will protect its confidentiality, prohibit its unlawful disclosure, and limit access to authorized personnel only.
