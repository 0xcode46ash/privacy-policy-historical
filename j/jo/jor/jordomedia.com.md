# Jordo Media Privacy Policy

**We hate spam just as much as you do -** Although we collect certain information from you, such as email, name, and shipping information, we do not, and will not, knowingly sell or provide that information to 3rd parties.   Periodically, we may send out bulletins advertising our our specials via normal mail or e-mail, but these mailings will be infrequent, appropriately marked, and contain a valid working link to remove yourself from the distribution.

 **Personal Information -** We do not store personal information about you, other than what is needed for us to conduct business with you.   We do not and will not knowingly provide this information to 3rd parties unless you request we do so.   We do not store credit card information.

**"Pop-up" advertisements -** We do not use "pop-up" advertising.   We may have links on this site that will display the user-requested link's information in a separate browser window, but this is done for your convenience and not to "annoy" you with unsolicited advertisements for Jordo Media.   We do have links to other websites but we do not allow them to use "pop-up" advertising on our site.   They could use this form of advertising once you enter their site from ours, though.
