# PRIVACY POLICY

JorgeCruise.com has created this privacy policy to let you know why we collect information from you and what we do with it. 

The first thing to remember about privacy is that there is only so much information that any web site can collect without your answering specific questions. JMF, Inc. logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as America Online or Yahoo!.) This information (in aggregate form) is recorded for administrative purposes only; IP addresses are not linked to any personal information. 

You can browse the website  and read our editorial content without registering or providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of our personalized services, you are required to provide us with personal information such as your name, email address and  real-world address. (We always let you know before we collect any personal information from you.) We collect similar information from users who choose to participate in our contests and promotional events. 

What do we do with the information that we collect?   
The information we collect from your membership helps us to improve our content, customize content of certain pages for you, and to send you updates about the site. 

Finally, the web site contains links to some other web sites. We cannot be responsible for the content of those sites or for the privacy of information that you may choose to share with them.
