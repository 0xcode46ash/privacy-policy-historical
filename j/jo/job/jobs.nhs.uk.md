## Sharing Your Information

NHS Jobs has an interface to the Electronic Staff Record System (ESR) which is a payroll and human resources system used by most NHS organisations and by a number of other organisations providing NHS services. The data you submit to NHS Jobs may be transferred to ESR for the purposes of: establishing the human resources and payroll record; completing the recruitment process or parts of the process on ESR; or for reporting purposes such as equal opportunity monitoring.

The data you submit to NHS Jobs as part of your job application may be downloaded and transferred to the employers' own system where an employer chooses to complete the recruitment process using their own system.

Employers may copy and hold some or all of this data locally in their own systems to facilitate their administration of the recruitment exercise.

We will not sell or share your information for marketing purposes.

We will not transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Community Area.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws and government or regulatory bodies' lawful requests for information.
