The various services offered by **JobStreet.com** may/will retain user and client information, or any preference data collected through its sites, in order to enable it to provide services for its users and clients. 

At **JobStreet.com** our principle concern is the responsible use of information that users and clients share and disclose to us. **JobStreet.com** 's commitment towards guaranteed confidentiality and privacy at all times is clearly articulated in our Privacy Policy. 

This document details the policies of **JobStreet.com** regarding Internet privacy issues to help users and clients understand the roles that technology and electronic commerce play in the collection and use of information provided. **JobStreet.com** wishes to ensure user confidence by promoting the principals of disclosure and fair information practices at our site. 

  1. **Collecting Personal Information**  
We collect information that users provide voluntarily to us, including registration information, employment resumes, and career profiles. **JobStreet.com** does not provide personally identifiable information of users to a third party unless **JobStreet.com** specifically informs users at the time of collection or unless the users themselves give express consent. The resumes are used for the purpose of job applications, and users themselves submit their resumes to prospective employers when applying online for a position. We have listed below the different types of information that are collected. 
    1. **Registration Information**  
**JobStreet.com** requires users of MyJobStreet services to supply personal information during the Account Registration process. Specifically, users must supply the following: user selected login ID and password, first and last name, email address, birthday, city, state, and country. These are vital to **JobStreet.com** for internal verification of user identity. Occasionally **JobStreet.com** will send to registered users emails regarding updates to the web site. 
    2. **MyResume**  
Users of MyJobStreet also supply certain profile information as part of their MyResume. Unless **JobStreet.com** specifically informs users at the time of collection, or unless the users give express consent, **JobStreet.com** does not disclose any personally identifiable information to a third party. The My Resume information includes the following: postal address, gender, date of birth, nationality, phone/fax number, social/ID number, country of residence, and marital status; working experience profile, type of work, level of responsibility, availability status, salary requirements, extent of willingness to travel, willingness to relocate, skills, educational background, and CV/resume. Users optionally can provide two references in the resume. The resume information and references are only revealed to those prospective employers to which applications are specifically and directly sent. **JobStreet.com** might occasionally use a user's contact information (phone/fax, address) to contact a user in case of service problems though email is the preferred medium. 
    3. **Unique Identifiers Information**  
**JobStreet.com** 's MyJobStreet requires Malaysian users to supply their new Identification Card number and Singaporean users their NRIC number. Users of other national identity are required to supply their countries' respective identification numbers. These are used to verify and authenticate user identities (See Section F below). **JobStreet.com** does not disclose any of the above information to a third party. 
    4. **Preferences Information**  
**JobStreet.com** requires users of the MyJobStreet service to input their job preferences and availability status. **JobStreet.com's personal career agent, LiNa - a job matching software, uses this information for a job matching**.

The Authentication step reinforces the legitimacy of **JobStreet.com** 's users for **JobStreet.com** itself as well as for prospective employers.

In some cases, users are required to go through an Online Test while applying for a position.
