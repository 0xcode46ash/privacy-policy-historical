2.    Data collected during navigation

When you visit the Jobrapido Website, it collects certain Personal Data, such as the pages you view, the links or buttons that you click, the date and time when you access the Site, your IP address, your web browser and the operating system you use (the "Navigation Data").  
The Navigation Data may, by its very nature, allow Users to be identified through processing and association with data held by third parties. However, Jobrapido uses this data solely for the purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information concerning the use of the Site and for purposes strictly related to its operation. 

The Jobrapido Cookie   
When you visit the Site for the first time, Jobrapido saves a Cookie on your browser (identified as JE). This is a text string consisting of a code stored on your computer. This code allows Jobrapido to recognize your browser, to automatically identify you through your registered email and to display information connected with your interests. The Cookie is permanent and if not renewed will disappear after a period of 2 years. If you wish to delete the Cookie before this period, you can do so at any time using your browser settings. 

The Cookie will be placed on your computer only if this option is enabled on your browser. Some features of the Site may not work correctly if this option is disabled.

Third party cookies  
Jobrapido uses third party services that install Cookies. These third party services are:  
•    Google Analytics, provided by Google Inc, which installs the Cookies "__utma", "__utmb" and similar. For more information: developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies  
•    Google Adsense, provided by Google Inc, using the DoubleClick Cookie. For more information: www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-doubleclick

If you wish to receive further information about third party Cookies, please write to our email address.  
Other Navigation Data

When you open a new Job Ad notification email or click on a link it contains, your action is tracked for statistical purposes.

3.    Data provided voluntarily

Your email address

Jobrapido allows you to activate a notification system for new Job Ads (Job Alert). Users can activate the notifications using their email address, geographical area and/or the kind of job they would like to see Ads for. 

After your email address has been provided, the Data is used only to send an initial email that is just an example of the Job Alert Service, and a second email as a reminder. Actual registration with the Job Alert Service only takes place upon acceptance of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service by clicking on one of the links contained in the email.  
The email address is stored for the period and the purposes strictly necessary to request consent, and the Job Alert Service will not begin unless one of the links is clicked.  
You can enter the email address manually or you can identify yourself through the social network Facebook authentication service provided by Facebook Inc. Facebook authentication allows access to some basic information on your profile and information related to the permission you give when you authorize our application. Jobrapido, however, only uses your email address and does not record any other information, except in so far as is strictly necessary to make the integration work.  
When you click on the links in the messages sent to your email address, Jobrapido uses its Cookie to identify you on later visits, allowing you to change the search parameters you are monitoring and for which you are notified by email. If you don't want to be identified on the next visit, you can click on the "log out" link.

In addition to notifications for new listings, Jobrapido can send you specific job offers. These offers come from our partners who are interested in the professional profiles you are monitoring. Jobrapido will use the email address you provided solely and exclusively for the Job Alert Service. Jobrapido will not send any business or advertising mail of its own or from any third party to the address you give.  
When you cancel the Job Alert notifications, the Service will be discontinued and your address will be removed from our database. The Service may also be stopped and your email may be removed from the database in other circumstances, e.g., when you stop clicking on the Job Alert links.  
Users are free to give their own email address to receive the Job Alert Service. Failure to provide it, however, will make it impossible to obtain the requested Service.

Other Personal Data provided voluntarily  
As part of the Services offered by the Site, you may provide Jobrapido with other Personal Data besides your email address in order to receive more information and Services (such as requesting information, quotes, subscribing to Services offered by the Site, replying to an ad, reporting malfunctions etc.).  
This data will be processed by Jobrapido solely for purposes strictly related to your request. Failure to provide this information may make it impossible to obtain the requested Service.

Ad reply form  
This form allows you to contact the Job Advertiser directly, and also to attach your Curriculum Vitae. Jobrapido does not store any of the Personal Data provided in this way and only carries out the minimum processing of data necessary in order to send the Advertisers the information provided.

Job Advertisers  
This part of the Site allows businesses to request information on the Services Jobrapido offers for companies, such as posting Job Ads on the Site. The Personal Data provided will be used for offers relating to the Services mentioned, both through direct contact or by sending occasional email messages.

Uploading a Curriculum Vitae  
Jobrapido lets you upload your Curriculum Vitae onto its system so that Users can access it at any time. CVs so uploaded are shared with the companies of the Evenbase Recruitment Ltd Group, based in the UK and of which Jobrapido is a part, for personnel selection purposes.  
Please do not include confidential data in your CV (especially concerning health matters, religious affiliation or political opinions). Should the Curriculum be examined, any such information will be immediately deleted if the written consent of the Interested party has not been given.
