**_What Information Do We Collect? _ **

  * _Personal Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us -_ We only have access to and collect Personal Information (such as your name, mailing or billing address, telephone number, email address, and email preferences) that you voluntarily give us via email or through other direct contact from you, such as when you register to use the Site, when you complete a survey or enter a contest on the Site, or when you use any chat room functionality of the Site. This Personal Information is collected for the purpose of providing you with the services you request and responding to inquiries you make through the Site. We use this Personal Information as described below under the heading "How Do We Use Personal Information That You Voluntarily Provide". We will use certain information collected from your device that is not Personal Information in order to send you information about our products and those of certain third parties, as explained below. When we collect Personal Information from you, we will provide you with the opportunity to refuse to receive product information from (i) us or (ii) third parties. Should you opt to receive this product information, you may change your mind for the future. For example, each message you receive about a product will contain and easy to use "unsubscribe" hyperlink. 
  * _Information Collected by Automated Means -_ Whenever you use the Site, we, as well as any of our third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect information about how you access and use the Site ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include, in part, your browser type, your operating system, the time you spend on the Site, how many times you visit the Site, and the website you visited immediately before the Site. This Usage Information is collected for the purpose of providing us with information about the use of the Site by you and other users, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We use Usage Information to help us to keep the Site fresh and interesting to visitors like you and to tailor content of the Site to your interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information. By using the Site, you consent to our collection of Usage Information from you. 
  * _Device Identifiers -_ In the course of collecting Usage Information we may also collect your IP address, MAC Address or other unique identifier (each a "Device Identifier") for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, or other technology (collectively, "Devices") you use to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers. Our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Sites, we may view your Device Identifier. We use your Device Identifier to identify you when you visit our Site so that we can help ensure you have the best possible experience in using our Site. We also may use your Device Identifier to send you advertisements from third parties targeted to your interests. If you want us to stop using your Device Identifiers to send you targeted advertising, please follow the steps in the section below titled "How to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising." We may associate your Device Identifier with your other Personal Information that you voluntarily provide or that is automatically collected when you visit the Site. By using the Site, you consent to our collection of your Device Identifier. 
  * _Site Cookies_ _-_ The technologies used on the Site, including Device Identifiers, to collect Usage Information may include, without limitation: 
    * _Cookies_ _-_ "Cookies" are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. We may use cookies to collect and store certain information about you. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). 
    * _Web Beacons_ _-_ We may also include web beacons (also known as web bugs, Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels and clear GIFs) with the content and advertisements that we deliver to you, which we will use to collect information regarding your interaction with our content and advertisements appearing on our Site. A "web beacon" is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed or that an email has been forwarded. In addition, a web beacon allows third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. A web beacon may also tell your browser to get content from another server. 



We use cookies and web beacons (together, "Site Cookies") to gather information about how you use our Site. Information gathered through Site Cookies may be considered Personal Information. We use this information to track your interests in order to enhance your experience on our Site, understand your interests and how you use our Site, and track the effectiveness of advertisements on our Site. By using the Site, you consent to our collection of your Personal Information using Site Cookies.

_ReachLocal_

We also work with a company called ReachLocal Canada, Inc. and its affiliates and parent company in the United States of America (collectively, "ReachLocal"), which assists us in advertising our products and/or services. One of the products that we may purchase from ReachLocal is a retargeting product, which enables ReachLocal to show you advertisements for our Site when you visit other sites in the ReachLocal network or in third-party networks. ReachLocal is able to do this through the use of cookies that are provided by ReachLocal through its third-party partners ("Advertising Cookies"). The sole use of the Advertising Cookies is to show you advertisements for our Site; they are not being used to target you or collect information from you, including Personal Information, in any other way. Moreover, ReachLocal does not link or otherwise connect the information in the Advertising Cookies to any Personal Information that you may have provided to us. Please note that ReachLocal retains the information on the ReachLocal platform for purposes of quality assurance and campaign assessment.

If you have any questions regarding ReachLocal and/or the Advertising Cookies, you are encouraged to contact ReachLocal at [privacy@reachlocal.com](mailto:privacy@reachlocal.com). 

_Analytics_

We may use two products to analyze activity on our Site. We use ReachLocal's tracking technology and/or Google Analytics to understand how you use our Site so that we can enhance your experience on our Site. In each case, we provide your Personal Information to ReachLocal and your Device Identifiers to Google for processing and analysis. By using the Site, you consent to our transfer of your Personal Information and/or Device Identifiers to, and the use of such information by, these third parties. If you wish to opt-out of ReachLocal's tracking technologies, go to http://www.reachlocal.ca/trackingopt-out, and if you wish to opt-out of Google Analytics, go to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB>.

### _Do We Share Your Information? _

As described above, we share your Personal Information and Device Identifiers with Google and ReachLocal for processing and analysis so that they can help us understand how you use our Site so that we can enhance your experience on our Site. We may also share your Device Identifiers with third parties which will allow those third parties to send you advertisements targeted to your interests.

Except as described in the paragraph above, unless you ask or provide your consent to do so, we will not share your Personal Information with any third party outside of our organization, other than with our service providers and then only as is necessary to fulfill your request (e.g., to ship an order). Only employees of our organization and our service providers who need access to your Personal Information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to your Personal Information. We make our employee aware of the importance of protecting your Personal Information.

We may share anonymous, aggregated, demographic information about Site users with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked, and cannot be linked, to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person.

We will disclose Personal Information to a third party when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to allow us comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) is necessary, in our opinion, to: enforce our policies; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; investigate improper use of the site; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Site or sites of third parties.

In addition, if Lift Temp Inc. is to be sold, merged or amalgamated or is to sell or dispose of substantially all of its assets, your Personal Information may be transferred to a potential purchaser if, and to the extent, necessary for the purposes of deciding whether to proceed with the sale and completing the sale. If such a sale, merger, acquisition or disposal is completed, the purchaser may use and disclose your Personal Information only to the extent described in this Policy if the information relates solely to the carrying on of the business or activity or the carrying out of the objectives for which the sale, merger or acquisition took place.

### _Your Privacy Rights -- Access to and Control Over Your Personal Information _

### _How to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising _

You can set most web browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies, though either of those actions may affect your use of our Site. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. For example, by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, you can opt-out of some or all of the ads sponsored by some or all of the Alliance members. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (via opting out), you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies' pages where you can opt-out of receiving targeted advertisements from those companies. 

In addition, if you wish to opt out of any of the Advertising Cookies, you can do this simply by navigating to <http://www.reachlocal.ca/opt-out>, which will take you to a web page where you will be able to opt out of the Advertising Cookies currently used in connection with ReachLocal's remarketing product and our Site. 

### _Does This Policy Apply to Other Websites Linked To Or From the Site? _

The Site may contain links to other websites. Any Personal Information you provide on linked pages or other sites is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked pages or other sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these other websites or any other sites that are linked to or from our Site. We encourage you to learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of these other websites before providing them with Personal Information.

### _Do We Collect Information From Children? _

The Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 18. [ _Lift Temp Inc._ ] does not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information from any children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such Personal Information from our database. 

### _What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information? _

We take measures designed to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, copying, modification and destruction of your Personal Information. We provide physical, organizational, technological, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information we process and maintain. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. To protect the confidentiality of Personal Information maintained in your account, if any, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused.

### _How Is Your Personal Information Transferred and Stored? _

Personal Information collected when you use the Site may be transferred, processed and used outside of Canada, including in the United States of America, although we remain responsible for your Personal Information. The computers and servers in which we store and process your Personal Information are kept in a secure environment. These computers and servers may be located in countries outside of Canada, including the United States, and may therefore be subject to different laws than those applicable in Canada. While we aim to protect your Personal Information when it is transferred outside of Canada, the laws of other jurisdictions may require the disclosure of your Personal Information to governmental authorities under circumstances that are different than those that apply in Canada and are contemplated under this Policy.

We will store and retain your Personal Information only for as a long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. If we have disclosed your Personal Information to a third party in accordance with this Policy, we will ensure that it is only retained by that third party for as long as is necessary for that third party to complete the purpose for which we provided it to them.
