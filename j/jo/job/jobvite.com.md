# Privacy Policy - Jobvite

**This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 19, 2016.**

_This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Jobvite, Inc. (“Jobvite,” “we” or “us”) collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our web site  [www.jobvite.com](http://www.jobvite.com/) (the “Site”) and users of our on-demand recruitment application (the “Services”). The use of information collected through the Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing those Services to our customers. By using the Site and/or Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy._

Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting it. Not only do we abide by applicable laws and regulations and follow industry best practices for data security and privacy, we also never sell or share personal information.

For purposes of the Privacy Policy, personal information is information that can be used by itself to identify a specific individual and would allow us to determine the actual identity of and/or directly contact a specific living person. It includes information such as name, physical address, phone number, and email address.

Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to our customers. We provide a platform that enables our customers to manage their data subject to their own privacy policies. For information on how they handle personal information you provide through their career web sites, or through the use of our services in conjunction with theirs, please consult their privacy policies.

If you are located in the European Union, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring information and permitting the transfer of information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy. Jobvite complies with the Principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (see below).

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

You can generally visit the Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We do not collect personal information from our Site visitors without the Site visitor providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you request to receive company or product information or request an online demonstration of the Services, you will be asked to complete the online demo request form on our Site that asks for your name, title, e-mail address, company name, state or province, country and phone number. You can also voluntarily provide comments to Jobvite when submitting the request form. We use the information from the request form to deliver the requested information and/or provide you with the online demonstration of the Services.

In order to become a registered user of the Services, Jobvite requires you to create a user account. To register for a user account, you must provide the following personally identifiable information:

  * If you are an employer, you must provide your company’s name and e-mail address of a contact at your company.
  * If you are an employee of an employer, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country and zip code.
  * If you are a jobseeker, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country, zip code and password.



Providing any additional information beyond what is required at registration is optional.

**How We Secure Your Personal Information**

We take commercially reasonable efforts to maintain security protections in accordance with industry best practices to protect data we collect from loss, alteration, destruction, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the personal information we collect, we have implemented physical, electronic, and administrative procedures. We utilize hashing, encryption, and de-identification techniques to help ensure your privacy is safeguarded.

We have policies to help maintain control and physical security of the facilities used to store data and only allow access to authorized personnel, restrict access to data to those employees, contractors and agents that have a need to know the information in order to provide and support our services. All our employees are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to disciplinary or legal action if they fail to meet these responsibilities.

We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.

**Aggregate Information**

Jobvite may also automatically collect and analyze information about your general usage of the Site and Services. When you perform certain actions using the Services, Jobvite may track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site and Services you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system, and statistical information about types of jobs offered and qualifications of jobseekers submitting their resumes. Jobvite will collect, track and analyze such information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used by Jobvite and third party vendors to assist Jobvite in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of Jobvite’s business, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data. Jobvite may also gather information about you (that you voluntarily submit to Jobvite) when you log-in to the Services, provide feedback to Jobvite and/or send or receive communications regarding the Services.

Jobvite may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use the Services and provide you with the Services; verify your authority to enter the Site and access the Services; notify you of Services updates; improve the content and general administration of the Site and the Services; provide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future; and to send you targeted advertising. Jobvite does not provide e-mail addresses to third parties for marketing purposes.

When you send messages through the Services, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view your name and e-mail address. Any messages addressed to you through the Services can be sent to your personal e-mail address or to your Jobvite account inbox by setting your preferences on the “My settings” page.

If you elect to use our Site or the Services to contact a jobseeker or potential employer, Jobvite will generate an automatic e-mail that is sent to the jobseeker or potential employer, as applicable, inviting the jobseeker or potential employer to visit the Site. If the targeted recipient does not respond to the e-mail, Jobvite will not send any reminder e-mails or use this contact information for any other purpose.

**Invitations and Communications to Non-Registered Users**

Users of the Services and visitors to the career sites of our customers may forward job postings to third parties who are not registered users of the Site or the Services as an invitation to learn more about this job opportunity in accordance with the applicable terms set forth in the Jobvite Terms of Use posted to the Site at <http://www.jobvite.com/terms-of-use/> Jobvite does not store the information that a posting or invitation has gone to a third party unless and until that third party responds to the invitation.  If the third party responds to the invitation, the third party is treated like any other job-seeker, and the information Jobvite collects is treated in accordance with this privacy policy; in addition Jobvite will note at that time who invited the referral so that Jobvite customers are aware of the source of the referral and may use that information to reward the referring person.

**Children**

Jobvite recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Jobvite targets its Services and this Site to adults and not to children under 13.

**Disclosure of Your Personal Information**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

**Information Related to Data Collected through Jobvite Services**

Jobvite collects information under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Part of the Services offered by our employer customers includes providing notice to their employees and job-seekers concerning how their personal information is collected and used.  The resume or job application that an employee or other job-seeker submits will be provided only to the specific potential employers that you select when you apply for jobs online. Other employers and recruiters will not have access to your resume or job application unless and until you want them to.

Jobvite engages vendors and service agencies to assist us in providing the Services to you, and Jobvite will need to share your personally identifiable information (and data generated by cookies and beacons) with these vendors and service agencies. We may transfer personal information to these vendors and service agencies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers. _The vendors and service agencies do not receive any right to use your personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you._  Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Jobvite will not disclose personally identifiable information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent.

**Choice and Access to Data Controlled by Our Customers**

Jobvite has no direct relationship with the individual employees and job-seekers whose personal data it processes on our behalf of our customers. Individuals applying for jobs with employers that are Jobvite customers have an account set up under their email address that associates all applications for that individual with that email address. The individual can access their account at the Site and transmit requests to the employers to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data in an application. The employer is responsible for complying with the individual’s request. In accordance with applicable law, Jobvite retains an archive copy of the individual’s data for the period prescribed by such law. Additionally, if you are an employee or job-seeker and would no longer like to be contacted by a particular employer or employers, please contact them directly to resolve your concern.

**Information Disclosure for Legal and Other Exceptional Reasons**

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information: (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Jobvite Terms of Use or Master Subscription Agreement or (c) to protect our rights and the safety of users of our Site and our Services. In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Jobvite’s assets to which this Site relates. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.

**Data Retention**

Jobvite retains personal information and the personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide the Services to customers, job-seekers and employees enrolled in those Services. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with customers, and/or the period required by laws in applicable jurisdictions.
