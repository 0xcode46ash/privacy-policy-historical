## What Are "Cookies" and How Do We Use Them?

Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device in order to enable our systems to recognise it. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying; they merely provide certain features, such as tracking sales performance of our affiliates and partners. 

Type1 and Type2 visitors are both subject to cookies use on the JobTestPrep website. In addition to your personal information, when you use our website we may collect tracking information, such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and the pages you visited on the site.

JobTestPrep gets this information by using technologies (e.g. Google Analytics) to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our website and to better tailor our website to your needs. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our website or which pages get the most attention. Information such as this will only be used in aggregate form and will not identify you personally. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient.

If in limited circumstances we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection.

In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible.
