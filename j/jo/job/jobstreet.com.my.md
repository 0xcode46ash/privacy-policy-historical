**JobStreet.com** collects personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address or telephone number, work experience and other such data associated with a resume for job applications. When you register with **JobStreet.com** and sign in to our services, you are no longer unknown to us. 

**JobStreet.com** keeps track of your transactions with us and some of our affiliated business partners, including information about your use of the products and services we offer.

We use this information for operating the service, maintaining the quality of the service and providing general statistics.

Please keep in mind that when you apply for jobs advertised on **JobStreet.com** , your resume data in your MyJobStreet account and any other information that you disclosed during your job application will be made available to the companies you are applying to. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to browse that are linked from **JobStreet.com** so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on such websites outside the **JobStreet.com** domain name. 

**Use of your Personal Information**  
**JobStreet.com** does not sell, rent or share your personal information with other people or non-affiliated third parties except to provide you with the products or services you have requested. When you give us permission, or under these circumstances: 

  * When you apply to jobs through our services, your resume data in your MyJobStreet account and any other information that you disclosed during your job applications will be made available to the companies you are applying to. 
  * You can also optionally make your resume searchable by employers and recruiters who pay for access to our resume database and your resume. Employers and recruiters may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. Though we endeavor to ensure that employers and recruiters comply with the relevant privacy laws, JobStreet.com is not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time and still apply online to jobs. 
  * **JobStreet.com** works with business partners to provide some services. We provide the information only to trusted business partners who work with us or on our behalf under confidentiality agreements. Our business partners may use your personal information to help us communicate with you about offers from them or **JobStreet.com**. However, our business partners do not have any independent right to share this information; 
  * We observe the process of law and will establish or exercise our legal rights or defend ourselves against legal claims; 
  * We believe in sharing information in order to investigate, prevent or act on illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of JobStreet.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by the law; 
  * In the event that **JobStreet.com** is acquired by or merged with another company, we shall transfer your personal information to the new company. However, **JobStreet.com** will notify you prior to the transfer and before you become subjected to a different privacy policy. 

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in any country in which **JobStreet.com** or its business partners, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. **Control of your Personal Information**  
**JobStreet.com** offers you various choices for the use and sharing of your personal information, as well as subscription to various marketing preferences, products or services. You may go to the [MyJobStreet](http://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com/) account page to edit your personal information and preferences at any time. You may choose not to receive any marketing material from **JobStreet.com** or from any of our affiliated partners. You may also subscribe to additional products or services from this account. 

In addition, you may visit [MyJobStreet](http://myjobstreet.jobstreet.com/) to view, edit or delete your personal information or discontinue your subscription to marketing preferences, products or services from the **JobStreet.com** database. 

In both cases described above, you will be asked to make your requests while logged into a MyJobStreet account, so that **JobStreet.com** can associate your preferences with a particular service.

However, there are some **JobStreet.com** services that send out periodic emails to inform you of technical service issues, product surveys, new feature announcements and news about our products and services. You will be unable to unsubscribe from these emails as they are considered an integral part of the service you have chosen. 

You may delete your MyJobStreet account at any time. When you choose to delete your account, **JobStreet.com** will erase all your personal information from our database. 

**Security of your Personal Information**
