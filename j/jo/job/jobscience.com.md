# Privacy Policy - Recruitment on the World's #1 CRM

Jobscience is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you.

## Information About All Jobscience Visitors

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Jobscience users, collectively, use career areas and our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.

## Information About You Specifically

In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.

## General Information Disclosure

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Jobscience. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Jobscience and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information becomes the property of both Jobscience and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Jobscience is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives.

## Resumes

Since Jobscience is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. Your resume, with the exception of any personal contact information, will be searchable by all recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

## Privacy Commitment Changes

If we decide to change our privacy commitment for Jobscience, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about Jobscience’s privacy commitment, please feel free to call (866) 284-1892 and speak to one of our representatives.

## Safe Harbor Data Privacy Policy

Jobscience, Inc. (“Jobscience”) provides talent relationship management solutions to help its customers assess, acquire, develop, and align their workforces for improved business performance. Jobscience combines software, best practices and services so organizations can increase process efficiency, improve quality of hire, reduce risk, and return financial results, and abides by the Safe Harbor Principles of the United States Department of Commerce.

Jobscience respects the individual privacy of its clients and customers (and their clients and customers), employees, business partners and others who may use Jobscience’s services. In all cases Jobscience treats personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which Jobscience does business, but it also aims to uphold the highest applicable ethical standards in all its business activities.

Effective November 28, 2007, this Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that Jobscience follows with respect to the protection and transfers of personal information, whether it is in electronic, paper or verbal format, between the United States and the EU. This statement applies to all personal information Jobscience processes (except as noted below), including on-line, off-line, and manually processed data. Any employee whom Jobscience determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary process, up to and including termination.

## Safe Harbor

Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Jobscience declares that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles embodied in the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States of America. The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on the Safe Harbor Principles as they are articulated in a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions as a means to enable U.S. companies to satisfy EU law requirements for adequate protection of personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. If there is a conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern.

## Definitions

The following definitions apply to all statements throughout this Privacy Policy.

“Personal information” means any information or set of information that is transferred from the EU to the United States, is recorded in any form, pertains to or is about any individual, and can be linked to or used to identify that individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded, anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. Personal information does not include information that pertains to or is about a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.

“Sensitive personal information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Jobscience will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

## The Privacy Principles

Jobscience’s operations and processing of personal information conform to the following Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as stated below under the heading of each principle.

## Notice and Choice

To the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement, Jobscience reserves the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to Jobscience’s clients and customers without the knowledge of individuals involved. If and when Jobscience collects personal information directly from individuals in the EU, Jobscience will inform them about the types of personal information it collects from them, the purposes for which Jobscience collects and uses it, and the types of non-agent third parties to which Jobscience discloses that information. Jobscience will also inform those individuals about the choices and means, if any, that Jobscience offers to limit the use or disclosure of their information.

## Disclosures and Transfers

Jobscience will not disclose an individual’s personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true:

  * Jobscience has the individual’s permission to make the disclosure;
  * The disclosure is required by law or professional standards;
  * The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of Jobscience’s business;
  * The information in question is publicly available;
  * The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or
  * The disclosure is to another Jobscience entity or to persons or entities providing services on Jobscience’s or the individual’s behalf (each a “transferee”), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question:
  * is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection;
  * has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or
  * subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles.



Permitted transfers of information, whether to third parties or within Jobscience, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the U.S. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated.

## Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use and confidentiality of information, either for its own purposes or on behalf of its clients, customers and business partners, Jobscience has put in place and rigorously enforces appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information that Jobscience processes. However, Jobscience cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet.

## Data Integrity

Jobscience processes personal information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, Jobscience takes reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable for its intended use.

## Access and Correction

If an individual becomes aware that information Jobscience maintains about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review that individual’s information, the individual may contact Jobscience using the contact information below. In every case, Jobscience will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. The individual seeking to amend such information will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as name, address, birth date, and social security number. Jobscience may request additional identifying information as a security precaution. In addition, Jobscience may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, Jobscience may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.

## Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

Jobscience utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Jobscience periodically verifies that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. Jobscience encourages interested persons to raise any concerns about its implementation of this Privacy Policy using the contact information below. Jobscience will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

Any claim arising out of or relating to Jobscience’s adherence to the EU Data Directive, or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through Jobscience’s internal processes, will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Any arbitrator will be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology. The arbitration panel should apply Texas law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be Houston, Texas. All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding on the parties, which waive any right to appeal the arbitration award further, to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.

Jobscience is also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

## Changes

Jobscience may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles or the United States Department of Commerce. Jobscience will post any revised privacy policy in its work places, train its employees about such changes and how to comply with them, and will publish any amended privacy policy on this Web site or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site.

## Information Subject To Other Policies Or Standards

Jobscience is committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all personal information within the scope of the Safe Harbor Agreement. Certain information, however, is subject to policies of Jobscience that may differ in some respects from the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Information subject to such additional policies includes information obtained from or relating to a client, customer or business partner or former client, customer or business partner that is subject to the terms of any privacy notice to or agreement with such client, customer or business partner, any engagement letter or letters with such client, customer or business partner, and applicable laws and professional standards.
