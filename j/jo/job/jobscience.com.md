**Jobscience Privacy Policy**

* * *

Jobscience is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you. 

* * *

** Information About All Jobscience Visitors

* * *

**

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Jobscience users, collectively, use career areas and our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well. 

* * *

** Information About You Specifically

* * *

**

In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. 

* * *

** General Information Disclosure

* * *

**

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Jobscience, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a Jobscience and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information becomes the property of both Jobscience and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Jobscience is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives. 

* * *

** Resumes

* * *

**

Since Jobscience is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. Your resume, with the exception of any personal contact information, will be searchable by all recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product. However, your personal contact information will never be given to recruiters without your explicit permission. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances. 

* * *

** Privacy Commitment Changes

* * *

**

If we decide to change our privacy commitment for Jobscience, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about Jobscience's privacy commitment, please feel free to email us at [info@jobscience.com](mailto:info@jobscience.com) or call 510-208-5627 and speak to one of our representatives.
