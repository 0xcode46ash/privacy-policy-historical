### **Links to other websites**

Our Site contains links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other websites. You are responsible for reading the privacy statements and policies of any linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

### **Security**

We have adopted appropriate security features in order to protect and keep secure personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.  We regularly review our security and encryption technologies and strive to protect personal information to the highest level possible. 

### **SSL** **Technology**

We employ Secure Service Layer (SSL) Technology whenever any transaction is completed over our Site. Indeed, transactions involving the passage of personal information occur in one of our secure online areas only.  SSL technology encrypts the information you send through our Site.  The use of SSL technology requires two components – 

  * An SSL–compatible browser; and
  * A web server to perform “key–exchange” that establishes a secure connection.



For you to benefit from the SSL Technology which we have implemented: 

  * you will need a browser with SSL capabilities.  The latest versions of commonly used web browsers generally have this capability.  However, it is your responsibility to check that this is the case.  If you do not already have a browser with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL browser from a vendor's website.
  * You will also need an internet service provider that enables SSL technology. Nearly all internet service providers automatically enable SSL technology, but you will need to ensure that this is the case with your service provider.



jobsjobsjobs Limited makes no warranty or representation in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the encryption capabilities of SSL Technology and jobsjobsjobs Limited is not responsible in any way for events arising from any unauthorised access of the information you provide. 

### **Tracking activity on our websites**

When you browse the Site and have not registered for any online products or services, you browse anonymously.  Personally identifiable information – such as your name, address, telephone number and email address – is not collected as you browse.  However, we track how our Site is used by both anonymous visitors and our registered customers, by using a small string of text that is sent to your browser known as a ‘cookie’. Our use of cookies is described in more detail in the next section. 

### **Cookies**

Cookies collect information that include the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type and how you gained entry to the Site.  Therefore, when you visit the Site anonymously, details are recorded about your visit, such as how you have used the Site, the time and date of your access to the Site, pages of the Site that you accessed and the time you spent on the Site.   This information is used in an anonymous form for statistical purposes and as such, cannot be used to identify you individually. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses or capture your email address or any other personally identifiable information.  You should note that accepting cookies is required if you want to view our Site, because they are essential for our Site administration and security.
