What Information We Collect/How We Use It 

We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form requests that you provide certain contact and profile information (like your name, e-mail address, postal address, and phone number). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive VHMnetwork Services; other information is optional. The required information is indicated as such on the registration pages of the VHMnetwork Web Site. Depending on the specific VHMnetwork Services for which a user registers, certain category specific information will be requested. We use this additional data to personalize your VHMnetwork experience.

Other than the information we require in order to provide one or more VHMnetwork Services to you, you do not have to provide any further information. But your election to withhold certain information will limit the value of the VHMnetwork experience for you.

In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your VHMnetwork membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).

We also collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened an VHMnetwork e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify any of the information you have provided by following the instructions set forth below.

We use all of this information in the following ways:

  * to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; 
  * to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; 
  * to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; 
  * to send you general and administrative information about your VHMnetwork membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and 
  * to provide your contact information to VHMnetwork marketing partners to allow them to send you special offers via electronic delivery and direct mail and via telemarketing. This most often occurs when you request that we do so such as when completing an online survey.
