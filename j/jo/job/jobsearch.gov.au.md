This web site is managed and maintained by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department). When you visit this web site, we record anonymous information about your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes - your server address, your top level domain name (for example, .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc), the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used. This information is not specific to you and is used for system administration purposes, as well as statistical analysis. While anonymous information does not tell us anything about you specifically, it tells us about how you use our site. Third party measurement organisations including [Neilsen//NetRatings](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/ "External site. Opens in a new window.") measure and report on this information for JobSearch. 

Another type of anonymous information shared between your browser and our server is a cookie. A cookie is a small text file that a server places on your hard drive to identify that subsequent requests to a site have come from the same user. The Department uses cookies to 'remember' your browser between page visits. In this situation, the cookie identifies your browser, not you personally. The Department uses cookies on this web site to develop patterns of site usage.

No attempt is made by the Department to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Department's logs. This site collects some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or gender. This information is not displayed on the site and your identity is protected, and the onus is on you to disclose any relevant personal details. Any personal information collected by this site will not be sold or divulged to any third party without your permission. The Department will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message or if you are required to enter an e-mail address to enable you to use the services provided by this site. This information will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose and will not disclose it without your consent.
