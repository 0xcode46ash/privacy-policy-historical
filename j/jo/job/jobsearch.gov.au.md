Australian JobSearch advises job seekers to protect their privacy by ensuring they do not provide personal information, including bank account details to anyone they do not know.  Job seekers are urged not to provide bank account details to any prospective employer until you have signed a contract of employment and/or you are satisfied with the bona fides of that employer.
