# Privacy - Australian JobSearch

Private browsing appears to be enabled. This application runs faster with private browsing mode turned off.

All personal information collected by the Department of Employment (the department) is protected by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The department’s contracted service providers (including subcontractors) are also required to comply with the Privacy Act.

Further information about the department’s personal information handling practices can be found in our complete [APP Privacy Policy](http://docs.employment.gov.au/node/33883 "External link. Opens in a new window.").

**How the department collects and uses your personal information**  
The department collects your personal information to assist you to find employment, and so that you can take full advantage of JobSearch services. The types of personal information collected by the department may include your name, date of birth, Job Seeker ID, Centrelink reference number, telephone number(s), facsimile number, email and personal website.

**Personal information**  
The department collects your personal information directly from you when you register or update your personal details on JobSearch. There may be circumstances where personal information comes from a third party, such as Centrelink, if you have agreed or would reasonably expect your personal information to be collected in this way.  
When you register your personal information on JobSearch, you will be asked to select what personal information you want to be displayed on your resume.  
 

**Sensitive information**  
Depending on the nature of the personal information that you provide in your resume, cover letter or application, the department may also collect “sensitive information” about you. This includes information about your race or ethnic origin, membership of a political, professional or trade association, or trade union, or criminal record. There are additional requirements that apply to the collection and use of sensitive information by the department, so you will be asked to confirm that you have read this privacy statement before you can proceed with uploading this information.  
The department uses your personal information to:

  * determine if you are eligible to take part in services provided by a Job Services Australia provider
  * give you employment opportunities
  * provide you with ready access to your job search related documents, and allow you to access your Application History and forward this information via email to a recipient of your choice. Please note, the Application History functionality will be available from 1 July 2014.
  * make sure correct payments are made to Job Services Australia providers for services they provide
  * evaluate and monitor outcomes, programmes and services delivered by Job Services Australia providers
  * assist in resolving complaints made by you or your Job Services Australia provider
  * include you in surveys conducted by the department and its contracted providers
  * help in the administration of programmes
  * help improve our service to job seekers.



By using JobSearch you consent to your personal information being used for the above purposes. If you do not provide all or some of the personal information required, you may not be able to access all JobSearch services.  
 

**Who has access to your personal information?**  
The department may share your personal information with third parties to deliver its employment services and assist you to find employment.  
By applying for a position advertised on JobSearch you are requesting and authorising that the department pass your personal information to the employer as a part of your application.  
Your personal information may be disclosed by the department to:

  * the Department of Human Services
  * the Department of Social Services
  * employment service providers - to assist them to provide employment services
  * recruitment organisations (whether contracted to the Commonwealth or not)
  * Serco Global Services (under contract to the department) – limited information to enable Serco Global Services to assist job seekers
  * employers.



In limited circumstances, the department may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties, including where:

  * the department has reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your life or that of another person
  * the disclosure is required or authorised by, or under law; or for the enforcement of criminal law or of a law imposing a fine
  * for the protection of the public revenue



**Amending your personal information**  
Registered JobSearch users can amend their personal information where it is incorrect by accessing their account details on the JobSearch website.

You may also seek access to, or correction of, your personal information stored in relation to the JobSearch website and application. Further information on seeking access to, or correction of, your personal information is contained in the department’s [APP Privacy Policy](http://docs.employment.gov.au/node/33883 "External link. Opens in a new window.").

**Email communications**  
The department will only record your email address if you send us a message or if you are required to enter an email address to enable you to use the services provided by JobSearch. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list.  
The JobSearch website allows registered JobSearch users to refer job vacancies to another person by email. You may have received an email as a result of a registered JobSearch user electing to refer this job vacancy to you, and entering your personal information (name and email address) into a job vacancy referral form on the JobSearch website.

In these circumstances, the department will only use your personal information for the purpose of sending you that email.

If you have any enquiries or wish to provide feedback about the JobSearch website or JobSearch job vacancy referral emails, please contact [AJSfeedback@employment.gov.au](mailto:AJSfeedback@employment.gov.au).
