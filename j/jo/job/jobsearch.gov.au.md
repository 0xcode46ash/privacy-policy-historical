# Privacy - Australian JobSearch

It is important that you read this Privacy Notice, which may change from time to time, so that you understand how your personal information will be handled as a user of the Australian JobSearch website (JobSearch). This Privacy Notice informs you of the collection of your personal information by the Department of Employment (the department) in accordance with the department’s functions in connection with the delivery of employment services and ensuring compliance with participation and activity test requirements. It also informs you of how your personal information will be used and the circumstances in which it may be disclosed to another party.

All personal information collected by the department is protected by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act).

###  Amending your personal information

Job Seekers and Employers can amend their personal information on JobSearch if it is incorrect by accessing their account details on JobSearch.

You may also seek access to, or correction of, your personal information stored JobSearch. Further information on seeking access to, or correction of, your personal information is contained in the department’s [Complete Privacy Policy](http://www.employment.gov.au/privacy "External link.

###  Email communications

If you have provided your email address on JobSearch, or if you have communicated with the department by email, your email address will not be added to a mailing list.

However, you should be aware that JobSearch allows registered JobSearch users to refer Vacancies to another person by email. Therefore, if a registered JobSearch user elects to refer a Vacancy to you by entering your personal information (such as your name and email address) into a job vacancy referral form on JobSearch, you will receive that referral. In these circumstances, the department uses your personal information for the purpose of sending you that referral.
