A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser.

**External Links**

As an Applicant, you can decide not to post your resume and still establish an Account. By completing a Qualifications Summary, you can maintain your confidentiality while being made aware of career opportunities. The text of your Qualifications Summary is keyword searchable. If registered hiring authorities or recruiters want to contact you they can send an Inquiry to you. You then have the option of responding to their Inquiry or not. 

You can post your resume but omit your name and contact information. Because your resume can be keyword searched, your file is more likely to be retrieved by hiring managers when they are conducting a search. Keeping a resume on file also allows you to respond quickly to interested recruiters who have sent an Inquiry to your "My Home" page on JobsInME.com. 

If confidentiality is not important to you, you can post your resume including your name and contact information. All hiring authorities and recruiters who are Registered Users of the JobsInME.com Applicant Database will have access to your file including your name and all contact detail as supplied by you.
