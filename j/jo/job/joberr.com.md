# Privacy Policy - Joberr

Our privacy is a very sensitive subject for us and we take it very seriously. So our privacy policy is simple, we don't sell, barter, give away or rent your personal information to any company outside of Joberr. We do have partners that assist us with fulfillment and shipping in certain categories, and in those cases those partners receive a name and shipping address so that they can process and ship orders properly.

 Also, Joberr may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of 10Spott, our users, or others.

  **  When Ordering**:  
 The only information we require to process an order is the following:

 Your name  
 Your credit card number  
 The expiration date  
 The billing address of the credit card (for security purposes)  
 A shipping address (if different from billing address)  
 A phone number so that we can contact with any questions concerning your order.  
 An email address for registration purposes.

  **  Information We Won't Ask For**  
 Joberr does not request sensitive information such as a social security number, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) from a bank or credit card, or a driver's license number.

  **  What About "Cookies"?**  
 "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We do not use "Cookies".

  **  Changes to our Policy**  
 Our Policy is intended to provide you with the safest and most secure shopping experience possible.

 Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Please periodically review our Privacy Policy for changes.
