# Jobsite Privacy Statement

The Protection of Your CV 

As a recruitment website, we give you the option of putting your CV in our database. There are two ways of doing this. You may store your CV in our database and hide it. Hiding your CV means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but recruiters will not have access to search it.

Alternatively, you can store your CV in our database and allow it to be searchable. If you allow your CV to be searchable, then all recruitment agencies who pay for access to our CV services will have access to your CV. To protect your interests, Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Ltd does not allow direct employers access to our CV Services.

We use our best efforts to grant access to our CV services only to paying recruitment agencies. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as a recruitment agency and paying for the service, gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV.

Equally, our terms and conditions prohibit any CV forwarded by Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Ltd from being forwarded to any third party except, with your permission, to an employer with the express intention of gaining you employment. If any recruitment agency is found to be breaching this condition, then we will immediately terminate their use of Jobsite's services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be found at the bottom of this page.

You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruitment agencies who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of CV in these instances.

General Privacy Statement 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your searches in any single visit. These cookies expire half an hour after you leave the site, and do not allow anyone to access your confidential information. If you are using a shared computer, please ensure that you log out of MyJobsite or close down the browser before leaving the computer for the next user.

Users may opt-out of receiving Jobs-by-Email alerts; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.

This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

From time to time, we run contests and online surveys. We may ask visitors for contact information (like their email address), careers information, and demographic information (like their post code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys and contests to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The visitors contact information is used by Jobsite to contact the visitor when necessary, no information will be passed to third parties, except in aggregate. Contact details will not be released by Jobsite, although Jobsite may send messages to visitors on behalf of its partners.

Security 

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. You can gain access to your Jobsite account and modify the information stored there by supplying an email address and password. You must ensure that this information is kept secret.
