# GoJobsite UK Privacy statement

The Protection of Your CV 

We regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible to recruiters.

As an operator of a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.

The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide" means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use it when applying for individual jobs.

We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be breaching these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their use of GoJobsite's services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be found at the bottom of this page.   
You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these instances.

Jobs by E Mail Service

The Jobs by Email service matches a job seekers requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on any one of our Sites. For job seekers who subscribe to this service you receive an email listing those jobs that we believe you should be interested in. Your requirements are defined by you using "strings" which can be used to specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of the job you want. You can change the strings at any time or unsubscribe at any time.
