**About Jobs2Web and the information Jobs2Web collects**

Jobs2Web is committed to protecting your privacy and has created this Privacy Policy to protect your personal information and to inform you about how Jobs2Web handles it.  This Privacy Policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on websites owned or operated by Jobs2Web ("Jobs2Web", "Jobs2Web.com", the "site" or "website", the "Jobs2Web Service", or "Service") through an opt-in registration process conducted on behalf of Jobs2Web customers (the "Site") but does not apply to any website not owned or operated by Jobs2Web or offline point of contact between Jobs2Web, or any other company, and consumers.  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as Jobs2Web may modify it from time to time.  You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of the modifications.  Each time you visit the site or provide Jobs2Web with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in the then current Privacy Policy.

**Your Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Jobs2Web**

The opt-in subscribe form collects certain information you voluntarily choose to share with Jobs2Web, such as your name, email address, and phone number (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”).  You may always choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit Jobs2Web’s ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content.  Jobs2Web may also collect other data, which may include Personally Identifiable Information.  

**Personally Identifiable Information Used by Jobs2Web Clients**

Jobs2Web works with employers and other companies ("Clients") to provide the Jobs2Web Service.  Information about your use of the Service and visits to the Site may be used by Jobs2Web and Clients.  Your Personally Identifiable Information is only shared with the specific Client for which you visited and to which you subscribed.  Jobs2Web disclaims all liability for the privacy policies and procedures on all Clients’ websites.

**Cookies**

Jobs2Web uses cookies to expedite and improve your experience while using the Site.  Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to Jobs2Web when you visit the Site, and which may be correlated with your Personally Identifiable Information in Jobs2Web’s log files.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issues the Cookie to you.  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.  Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.

The type of information that may be stored in a cookie includes non-Personally Identifiable Information about you such as a randomly assigned user or session identification number.  Jobs2Web reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with third parties, but will not allow other companies to place cookies on a Jobs2Web Site unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging another site that relies on third-party cookies).

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may affect the functionality of the Site.

**IP Address**

Jobs2Web logs standard information such as your IP address along with the URL from which you came to the Site and the URLs visited on the Site, which may or may not contain some Personally Identifiable Information.  When Jobs2Web sends messages to you or others, Jobs2Web may provide a URL link to the Site that contains an alphanumeric identifier, which allows Jobs2Web to identify the person to whom the message was sent so that the content can be personalized for that individual.

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Jobs2Web**

Jobs2Web uses the collected Personally Identifiable Information to verify your identity and to contact you in connection with your use of the Service.  If you opt-into a Service that generates communication to you from Jobs2Web (other than communications sent to you for the sole purpose of addressing a technical or operational issue regarding the Jobs2Web Service), you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving further such communications from Jobs2Web. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Jobs2Web does not sell, share or otherwise provide any "Personally Identifiable Information" you give to us with any third party other than Clients.   

**Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information by Jobs2Web Clients**

Contracted employers using Jobs2Web Services may receive or access your Personally Identifiable Information in conjunction with their use of the Services.  You may at any time choose to opt out of receiving further communication from Jobs2Web.  However, even if Jobs2Web blocks further use of your contact information, Jobs2Web cannot prevent employers who have obtained previously your Personally Identifiable Information from Jobs2Web from contacting you directly.  Jobs2Web recommends contacting the employer directly if you wish to opt-out of further communication.  PLEASE NOTE:  The privacy practices of Clients who use the Services or the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact those organizations directly for more information about their privacy practices.

**Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information, Jobs2Web Communications Content, Data and Information**

Jobs2Web may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or the contents of your private communications if required to do so by law or court order.  Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be disclosed to a Client using the Services.  Jobs2Web will in no way disclose the contents of your Jobs2Web communications other than to the intended recipient(s) unless required (1) by law or court order, (2) to protect Jobs2Web's rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of the Site, and (4) during emergencies such as when Jobs2Web believes someone's physical safety is at risk.

Also, certain technical processing of messages and their content may be required to: (1) send and receive messages; (2) conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (3) conform to the limitations of the Service; or (4) conform to other similar requirements.  It is possible that as Jobs2Web continues to develop its Service and business, Jobs2Web and/or related assets may be acquired.  In such a transaction, Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

Jobs2Web reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that in good faith Jobs2Web believes to be unlawful.

**Security**

This Site has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and integrity of the information under Jobs2Web’s control.  Although Jobs2Web makes good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, Jobs2Web cannot guarantee complete security.  You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

The security of the PII collected is of the utmost importance to Jobs2Web.  Jobs2Web takes all commercially reasonable steps to secure your PII.  Reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect has been implemented and is updated periodically as deemed necessary by Jobs2Web.  With this in mind, Jobs2Web limits access to PII to only those employees and contractors who need access in order to perform their duties.
