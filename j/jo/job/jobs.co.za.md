# Jobs.co.za - Privacy Policy

JobNavigator is an online service created for the specific purpose of assisting job seekers in the development of their careers, and in identifying potential employment or contracting positions. In addition, Job Navigator assists employers or their representative agencies in identifying individuals for potential employment or contract positions. In doing this, JobNavigator handles a great deal of personal and confidential information. Understanding this, and the importance of privacy and confidentiality to our subscribers and Web site visitors, we have created these guidelines.

**What personal information does JobNavigator collect?  
**JobNavigator gathers personal information in two ways, and for two specific purposes. Firstly, as a service designed to assist job seekers in identifying appropriate positions and in developing careers, Job Navigator makes a request for you to complete your curriculum vitae (CV). This CV information comprises personal details, contact information, details of education and qualifications, salary information, and skill profiles. The second type of personal information gathered by JobNavigator is behavioral information in the use you make of JobNavigator or explicit personal preference information requested by Job Navigator while you make use of the service. People can visit JobNavigator web sites and access information while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information. However, in general the best use is made of JobNavigator when CV information has been disclosed or when preference information is provided.

**How does JobNavigator make use of your personal information?**  
JobNavigator utilises the CV information you provide to identifying potential positions or career development opportunities for you in its various databases. In addition, JobNavigator provides your CV information to recruitment agencies should they identify your CV in a database search as representing an appropriate individual for a position they are attempting to fill. Finally, JobNavigator provides access on your behalf to your CV in our database to potential employers where you have specifically responded to a position advertised by those employers through JobNavigator. JobNavigator endeavors to qualify recruitment agencies making use of our databases as bona fida recruitment agencies. JobNavigator maintains a strict policy of not allowing employers to search our databases directly for the specific reason of concern over job seekers' confidentiality. At any time you provide us with information, you will be able to indicate whether you want to receive additional information from JobNavigator. JobNavigator will not collect information from people who identify themselves as being under 18 years of age in areas of the web site which may be of interest to children. JobNavigator encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet. Several software packages are available to help parents actively manage their family's use. People under 18 years of age may request mailed or other information from Job Navigator by having their parents submit the request.
