Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information you agree that you are consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Jobirn [Terms of Use](http://jobirn.com/term_and_conditions.html). If a term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it is defined in the [Terms of Use](http://jobirn.com/term_and_conditions.html).

You will also be able to enter information about your cell phone and work phone, and alumni information (including your college, graduated year, major, degree and summary).

To become a referrer, your company, job function and working experience is required.

**_Information about your Contacts:_**

In order to invite others to connect with you directly or get recommended from others in Jobirn, you will enter their names and IM/email addresses. This information will be used by Jobirn to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and IM/email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. 

**_Cookies, Log Files & IP Address:_**

As you use our Service, we may also passively collect certain information, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names, access times, and operating system. We also use Cookies, clear GIFs, and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your use of the Service. This type of information is collected to make our Services more useful to you and to help us improve the Site. You must accept cookies to access Jobirn as a registered user. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

**_Children:_**

Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service. 

## **Use of Information**

**_Use of_** **_Personally Identifiable Information by Jobirn:_**

We use the collected personally identifiable information to verify you and to contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other activities on the Site, to forward to you messages from other Users, to communicate with you about Job opportunities of interest to you and to operate the Jobirn Service.   
Use of our invitation or get recommended service to tell a friend about our Site or a job opportunity, or your request for recommendation, or to participate in a referral chain, requires that you enter your friend's IM/email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time IM/email inviting him or her to visit the site or view the opportunity. Jobirn stores this information to send this one-time IM/email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of the Jobirn referral program. Your friend may contact us at Jobirn to request that we remove this information from view in our active database (please use Jobirn Privacy in the subject line). 

**_Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Other Users:_**

Other Users will be able to search and view the personally identifiable information that you provide on your profile, except your contact information and resume (could search, but can't view). Only your targeted referrers or recruiters could view your resume, for the purpose of employment. 

Other users may choose to contact you. However, to ensure your privacy, Jobirn will not display or give out your IM/email address or any other contact information to other users on the site. We have developed a process that uses a "double-blind" email system, which hides the IM/email addresses of both the sender and recipient of messages to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver. When using the process on the site, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your IM/email address, or any other contact information, to others through private communications. 

Similarly, you may contact other Users on the site, and Jobirn will hide your IM/email address by using the "double-blind" email process on the site. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other. 

## **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Jobirn, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. We may send your contact information to third party companies, in order to fulfill a service, if that service is provided by third party companies. In addition, if we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your personal information to the party or parties involved as part of that transaction. 

## **Update/Delete Your Information and Preferences**

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Jobirn service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Jobirn Newsletter, that are considered part of your Jobirn account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

You can delete your Jobirn account by clicking on "Close account" in "Setting" tab after you login. Jobirn may retain your information for our own records. 

## **Confidentiality and Security**

We restrict access of your personal information from our employees, unless we believe it is reasonably necessary to do their jobs. 

We fully comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 

## **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Jobirn may update this policy. We will change the way we treat personal information without any prior notice.
