## **Use of Information**

**_Use of_** **_Personally Identifiable Information by Jobirn:_**

We use the collected personally identifiable information to verify you and to contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other activities on the Site, to forward to you messages from other Users, to communicate with you about Job opportunities of interest to you and to operate the Jobirn Service.   
Use of our invitation or get recommended service to tell a friend about our Site or a job opportunity, or your request for recommendation, or to participate in a referral chain, requires that you enter your friend's IM/email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time IM/email inviting him or her to visit the site or view the opportunity. Jobirn stores this information to send this one-time IM/email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of the Jobirn referral program. Your friend may contact us at Jobirn to request that we remove this information from view in our active database (please use Jobirn Privacy in the subject line). 

**_Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Other Users:_**

Other users will be able to search and view the personally identifiable information that you provide on your profile, except your contact information and resume (could search, but can't view). We allow referrers or recruiters to view and download your resume, for the purpose of employment. 

Other users may choose to contact you, and you may choose to contact other users. Jobirn has developed a process that uses a "double-blind" email system, which hides the IM/email addresses of both the sender and recipient of messages to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver. When using the process on the site, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your IM/email address, or any other contact information, to others through private communications. 

Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other. 

## **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We may disclose your personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to third parties, including business partners, independent contractors, auditors, lawyers for purposes that we deem appropriate. If you choose to receive a service offered on Jobirn, and if that that service is provided by a partner or third-party company (e.g. education opportunity, resume services which are provided by third parties), personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to Jobirn) will be shared with those partners to the extent necessary for them to provide these services. Third party lead generation company may contact you by phone and/or by email to provide education related information. These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services.

In addition, if we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your personal information to the party or parties involved as part of that transaction. 

## **Update/Delete Your Information and Preferences**

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Jobirn service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Jobirn Newsletter, that are considered "transactional or relationship" messages, or otherwise part of your Jobirn account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

You can delete your Jobirn account by clicking on "Close account" in "Setting" tab after you login. Jobirn may retain your information for our own records.
