In order to enhance their use of the SSM Sites, users can leave comments on articles. When they do so, users must submit information including a valid email address. SSM uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use, and will not pass this information on to any other organization.

 **2) Log Files**  
Activity on all SSM sites is recorded in standard web server log files. These files store information about each visit such as but not limited to the visitor’s IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), pages viewed e.g. on entry/exit, platform type, and visit date/time. This information is used for SSM’s understanding of user behavior in order to improve the user experience. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Outbound Links**  
The SSM Sites will contain links to other sites. Please be aware that SSM is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and as such, users should be careful to search out and read the privacy policies of each and every linked Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy only applies to information collected by Share Select Media.
