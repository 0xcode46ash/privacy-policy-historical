If you are a customer of such a ZipRecruiter client and would no longer like to be serviced by such client, please contact the client directly. If you seek access or want to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, you must direct such request to that client (the data controller). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by our service agreements with our clients.

We will retain Personal Data that we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client.

####  **7. _WHERE YOUR DATA IS TRANSFERRED_**

ZipRecruiter Inc. is headquartered in the United States of America (USA).  The information that you provide or that we collect as a result of your interaction with the Website and/or your use of our services on the Website is transferred to the USA and/or to another country where we have a subsidiary or where we have engaged service providers. Some countries that are not located within the EU may be recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection.  For transfers from the EU to countries not considered as adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place measures, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your Personal Data. When we transfer Personal Data from the EU or Switzerland to the USA, we also rely on the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”), and in making such transfers, we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, as described in our Privacy Shield certification.

We are committed to upholding the Privacy Shield Principles.

To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [[https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list)]

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [[https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint)], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

####  **8. _HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT_**

We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to, the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations in relation to that Personal Data, e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations, whether our relationship with you is ongoing, e.g., where you use more than one of our products and/or services, any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights, e.g., the defence of any claims. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain and securely destroy your Personal Data subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.

#### 9\. _COOKIES & TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES_

ZipRecruiter and third parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies (e.g., pixels, beacons, scripts, etc.) (“ _Tracking Technologies_ ”) in connection with the Website to collect information about interactions with the Website. For more information about the types of cookies and Tracking Technologies that we, and certain third parties use, and why we use them, and how you can control these, please review our policy regarding [**_Cookie Policy_**](https://www.jobboard.io/cookie-policy/).

If you are accessing the Website from other than the EEA, you understand that we apply U.S. law and the U.S. advertising industry self-regulatory program to Tracking Technologies associated with the Website.

#### 10\. _DATA SECURITY_

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data we process about you.

However, no transmission of information via the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, you acknowledge that there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control and accordingly, the security, integrity and privacy of data exchanged between you and us through the Website cannot be guaranteed.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

The safety and security of your Personal Data also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your login or account credentials with anyone and keep your account information secure. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards, where information will be available to other users of the Website. If you believe that your access credentials or Personal Data have been compromised, please contact us immediately.

####  **11. _YOUR DATA SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS (_ _for data subjects in the EEA)_**

Data subjects in the EEA have the following rights with respect to their Personal Data:

 **YOUR RIGHTS**|  **WHAT CAN YOU REQUEST**  
---|---  
Right to **Information**|  The right to know what Personal Data we hold about you and how we use it.  
Right to **Access**|  The right to be provided with a copy of your Personal Data (subject to certain restrictions).  
Right of **Rectification**|  The right to require us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. If you have a user account with us, you also have the option of correcting your information directly in your account.  
Right **to erasure/be forgotten**|  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure and in such circumstances, will notify our reasons to you.  
Right to **restrict processing**|  The right to require us to restrict processing of your Personal Data, i.e., you can request that we suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  
Right to request **data portability**|  In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party in a commonly used machine-readable format. Note, however, that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.  
Right to **object to processing**|  You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data in the following circumstances: (i) at any time to your Personal Data being processed for direct marketing (including profiling); or (ii) in certain other situations, to our continued processing of your Personal Data, e.g., our processing of your Personal Data when such processing is based on our legitimate interests. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.  
Right **to withdraw consent at any time**|  You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  
Right **not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision-making**|  The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, your right does not apply if: (i) you gave us your explicit consent to use your personal data to make our decision; (ii) we are allowed by law to make our decision; or (iii) our automated decision was necessary to enable us to enter into a contract with you.  
  
 ** _Method for Requesting Information Pursuant to Your Rights_**

If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the table above (each, an “ _Access Request_ ”) please send an email to [dsars@ziprecruiter.com](mailto:dsars@ziprecruiter.com) and we will send you a Data Subject Access Request Form.

 ** _No Fee Usually Required_**

You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

 ** _What We May Need from You_**

Once we receive your Access Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If we are not clear as to what you are requesting, we may also need to contact you for clarification so we can more fully respond to your request.   

If we cannot locate any records about you, we may also ask you for additional information to assist us in locating records, if they exist.

 ** _Time Limit to Respond_**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
