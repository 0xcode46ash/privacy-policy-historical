#### Information Collection

Please be aware that JMM is committed to upholding the highest level of confidentiality and security for those who choose to visit our Website. The types of information collected by JMM on this Website fall under one of two categories: Anonymous or Personal.

#### Anonymous Information

Anonymous information cannot be traced back to a specific individual. Our web servers automatically record the IP address (the general location where the user is logged) of each visitor to this Website and tracks how many people visit our Website. We use this type of anonymous information to administer our Website more effectively, personalize this Website for you, and gain general information about the backgrounds and sources of visitors. 

#### Personal Information

Personal information identifies who you are. This is information that you personally and voluntarily provide as a result of a prompt on the Website. Such information includes, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, phone number, and email address. In the case of information provided to the America section of the Website (such as date of birth, marital status, gender, demographic, and other information), this data is handled by a third party.

#### Online Requests for Information

When you request information online from our Website, we ask for certain information in order to process your request.
