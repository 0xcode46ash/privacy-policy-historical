Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits; (iii) 'third party cookies' which are set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who monitor and analyze our web access; and (iv) 'flash cookies' which are saved during your use of the Site to allow quicker and better Site experience.
