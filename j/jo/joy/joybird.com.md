# Privacy Policy - Joybird.com

## Privacy Policy

From time to time, we here at Joybird Furniture will update our privacy statement based on the feedback we receive, and we’ll be sure to let you know by adding the word “Updated” next to our Privacy Policy link. It’s a good idea to take a peek at the changes, so you know how we’re protecting your information when you buy from us. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy or updates, don’t hesitate to contact our customer service department at support@joybird.com or 888-282-0842.

###  How we use the information we collect

When you place an order with us, we might ask for some personal information, like your name, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to:

  * Process an order
  * Verify your identity for payment authorization
  * Contact you regarding your order status
  * Ship your order to you
  * Allow you to apply for financing
  * Send you news from Joybird Furniture (if you have requested it)
  * Provide you with an excellent shopping experience



When you place an order with Joybird, we’ll transfer your name and address to your credit card company for confirmation to complete your purchase, and then to the third-party fulfillment center to deliver your order. We promise to never use your name and address for any other purpose, including selling it to mailing-list firms. Sometimes we do share blanket information and statistics about our customers with important business partners, but we’ll never reveal your individual details.

###  Surveys

Occasionally, we might ask you if you’d like to participate in a completely voluntary survey. The information you give us is entirely up to you and typically includes your first name, along with a review of your Joybird experience and a review of the products you purchase. We use this survey information to improve the shopping experience for you and your fellow customers. Some answers might be posted on our site to provide information about our products to other users, only after you give your permission. We promise to always ask and notify you before sharing any of your individual details and information with our third-party friends. 

###  Opt-Out Policy

If you’d rather not hear from us, we won’t take it personally! Just hit “unsubscribe” on our subscription status page and enter your information. You can also opt out by calling us at 888-282-0842 or emailing us at support@joybird.com.

###  Security

Here at Joybird Furniture, we’re committed to protecting your privacy and personal information. Whenever you submit information -- including your credit card number, name, and address -- to the Joybird.com e-commerence system via your computer, it’s encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. At our headquarters, we also use encryption and Web security technologies to protect your privacy and personal data. Only parties responsible for processing your order will have access to your credit card and bank information. We at Joybird constantly review our policies and practices to ensure that all of your information remains safe and secure.

We also love to hear your comments and feedback about the website or your shopping experience, and sincerely welcome any testimonials about our service or products.

###  Fraudulent Charge Protection

Don’t worry -- you are protected if a third party perpetrates credit card fraud using your personal information from a Joybird purchase.

###  Legal Disclaimer

The only time we’ll share your personal information is when required by law or with the good-faith belief that it is necessary in order to conform to the law.
