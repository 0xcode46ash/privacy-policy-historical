# Joomag Privacy Statement

**Updated as of Aug 06, 2015**

This privacy policy explains how Joomag handles personal information and other data we obtain from you anytime you interact with Joomag, such as when you browse on our website (joomag.com) or create a user profile, or when you use our service to upload or download content.   
Personal information means data which identifies an individual person, like name or email address. If we store personal information with data that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personally identifiable information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data, then the remaining data is non-personal. Data from merchant subscribers, like a business email address, is non-personal information. 

## Information we collect from you

Joomag does not collect, store or process personal information unless you choose to register with us.

If you choose to register with us at our website, Joomag collects and stores the information we require you to provide: your name, email address and password you choose. We combine and store this information together with additional information that we request in the Account Settings section at and after registration, such as the industry, sector, and type of publication that a publisher intends to create, and any PayPal account number. We also will combine your personal information with all the materials that you upload such as PDF and SWF files, video and audio files, and fonts, as well as with the operational information that we collect via technology while you browse our site (see the section below.)

Joomag uses this operational information to help us improve our service and customize your experience at our site. We use aggregated information to track trends and analyze use patterns.   
**Cookies:** Joomag also uses “cookies” – small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browse. Sending a cookie enables us to collect operational information and to keep a record of your preferences. We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you use features of our service; these disappear after you close your browser. If you agree to stay logged in, we will also use a persistent cookie that stays in your browser and allows us to recognize you when you return to the site.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the third party providing the function.

If Joomag learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Joomag account password, and not to reveal this information to others. Selecting a longer password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular basis.
