### Information Collection and Use

You may decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction. We do not collect information from individuals under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, we suggest that you should not submit any personal information through the Site. If we have specific knowledge that an individual under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information to the Site, we will delete such information permanently and without notice.

As described below, JoomSeller will only disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties based on belief that such action is necessary (1) to conform to legal requirements; (2) to protect and defend the rights or property of JoomSeller ; (3) to enforce the JoomSeller Terms of Service; or (4) in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all JoomSeller' assets related to the business in connection with or collected information. JoomSeller collects personally identifiable information that can be divided into the following categories:

**JoomSeller** **Product Registration Information:** Some JoomSeller products require you certain personally identifiable information as part of the installation/registration process (including but not limited to your name, email address, credit card information and connection type and number of computers). Certain information is necessary in order to conclude the transaction, and for applicable products, to be eligible to receive technical support. If you provide us with personally identifiable information, and select the "Inform me about important updates and news" option on the purchase confirmation page or in the in the "Registration Information" section located in the "Configuration Panel" of the "Control Panel" in the JoomSeller product, we use this information to send you communications, including informative emails/newsletters about JoomSeller product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services; and to provide you with special offers that may be of your interest, including paid advertisements from third parties. In the event that you no longer wish to receive such information, you may choose to opt out of receiving further communications by complying with the procedures listed in the "Updating/Unsubscribing Your Email Address" section of this Privacy Policy. Except for the case of Partner Products (see below), JoomSeller keeps personally identifiable information collected in the course of installation/registration of JoomSeller' products confidentially and does not sell, trade, or exchange mailing lists with any organization.

**Credit Card Information** : If you use a credit card to purchase products via this Site, your name (as appeared on the credit card), the credit card number, expiration date and billing address will be encrypted as it passes over the Internet. JoomSeller does not record or keep your credit card information for online credit-card transactions; rather such information is simply passed through to our contracted payment processing vendor. JoomSeller may access such information through the payment processing company, but does not do so except for processing refunds or adjustments and to the extent it is necessary in the event of nonpayment or disputed payments, or as may be necessary for JoomSeller' compliance, in JoomSeller' discretion, with applicable law.

**Technical Support** : If you request online technical support, we will ask you for necessary information to complete the transaction such as your name, email address and information about your computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. In the course of providing support, your data may be transmitted to service providers who are under contract to JoomSeller and have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure.

**Partner Application** : If you request participation in the partner program online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, email address, and company profile.

### If You Opt to Receive Communications, How We Will Contact You

**Email** : With your permission, JoomSeller will send you communications, including informative emails/newsletters about product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services. These communications provide you with special offers that may be of your interest. JoomSeller uses a third-party program of outbound email technology to send email from our servers and does not collect information about you but does collect requests to unsubscribe.
