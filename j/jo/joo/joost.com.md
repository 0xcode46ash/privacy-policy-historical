This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of the Joost® Application for the Apple® iPhone™ (the " _ **Joost Application**_ "). Any reference to the Site will also refer to the Joost Application.**_**_**_**_**_

 _ ** _ **

This policy answers the following questions:

  * What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?

  * Will we share your personal information with third parties?

  * What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?

  * Who can I contact if I have any questions about this Privacy Policy?




By accessing the Site or using any of the Joost Features, you consent to Joost's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.

## Information We Collect

### Registration and Your Personal Profile

When you register with the Site, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username (which may or may not be your real name), email address, gender, zip/postal code and date of birth.

When you use the Site or Joost Features, you will have the option of setting up a personal profile by providing general information about yourself, the URL of your website, address of your blog and a mood message. Additionally, when using the Site or Joost Features, you will have the option to form relationships, send messages to your friends and other users, perform searches and queries, form groups, add applications, and transmit information through various channels.

### Cookies

Like many websites, we employ "cookies" in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * to store a user's log-in identity so that your session won't expire unless you actively log out

  * to keep a record of the programming or advertisements you were watching when you last left the Site

  * to keep a record of any widgets or other additional applications that you have installed. 




You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site or Joost Features.

### Log Information

We also keep track of your interaction with the Site and other users. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site.

### Slurping

You will have the opportunity to connect with friends from your other networks, such as AOL, Gmail, LinkedIn, Hotmail and Yahoo.

The Site will identify the email addresses of the friends in your other networks, and if any of these friends are already Joost® users, we will offer you the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®, and if you choose to do so, a friend request will be sent by email. If any of your friends are not Joost® users, we will enable you to invite those friends to join Joost®. You will be able to select those friends in your other networks that you wish to invite (if any), and Joost will send one email on your behalf to each of these friends inviting them to visit the Site and register as a Joost® user. If any of your friends respond to your invitation, and subsequently register as Joost® users, you will offered the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®. If you choose to connect, a friend request will be sent by email.

After this process is complete, and any email invitation(s) have been sent, your friends' email addresses will be deleted from our servers (unless they have registered separately as Joost® users). We will not retain or use these email addresses for any purpose whatsoever, and will not contact your friends or create any connections unless you ask us to.

If your email address appears in anyone else's network, Joost may use your email address for the purposes described above.
