How We Secure PII 

We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your PII. For example, when you send sensitive PII information (such as your credit card number) to us online via our order form, that information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. One way to tell if you are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the webpage - secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with "https://" (unsecured pages start with "http://"). If you have any questions about security at our Site, send an email to [service@jossandmain.com](mailto:service@jossandmain.com). 

Changes to this Policy 

From time to time, we may change this Policy. You should check our Site periodically for changes to this Policy. If at any point we decide to use the PII you submitted in a way that differs materially from the Policy that applied at the time of that submission, you will be notified and given the opportunity via our Site, email or in writing to opt out or otherwise prevent such usage.
