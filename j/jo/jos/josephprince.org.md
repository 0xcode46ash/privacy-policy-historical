YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, AND HOW WE USE IT

* * *

We do not collect personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through our website, read pages, or download information, the web server will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We may use such information or any information you do provide to monitor our website’s performance, and to make improvements where necessary. 

**Information Stored Automatically**  
By default, all web server log files capture Internet Provider (IP) addresses. We may use your IP address internally to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our website and to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or cause damage.

A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a web server to your computer. We use cookies when someone logs onto our website to maintain that login, to retain login information (if requested) and for the maintenance of our shopping cart service. Any activity you engage in while you are at the Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. website may be tracked. We do not use cookies to track your Internet activity before you enter or after you leave our website. 

**The Information You Provide**   
If you are a registered user, you are required to provide your email address and password when you login to our website.

If you belong to a subscription programme or any other programme under Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc., we may ask for information which identifies you as a programme member.

When you place an online order or make an online donation, you will be required to provide your name, email address, mailing address, contact number, payment card details and/or other information (e.g. special delivery instructions). We may share selected information with our agents, sub-contractors (e.g. shipping company) and/or third parties (e.g. the issuer of your payment card) for the sole purpose of delivering the product(s) you requested or processing your donation.

When you participate in any contest or promotion, we may ask for your name, address, email address and/or other information so we can administer the contest/promotion and notify winners.

If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an email to Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc., or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our website, we may use that information to provide the information, service(s) and/or product(s) you have requested or to minister to you.

We do not collect personal information for other purposes. The information you provide is not released to any third party for commercial marketing and gains or otherwise, without your permission except where required by law to do so (such as in the investigation of fraud or other inappropriate activity).

## EMAILS FROM JOSEPH PRINCE MINISTRIES, INC. 

* * *

Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. has found that attractive, graphics-rich emails are a quick and effective way to inform our registered users and subscribers of new resources, clearance and sale items, projects and events to provide them opportunities to support our ministry. We maintain an opt-out, user-customisable subscription database of users who have requested to receive these emails. Every email provides an option for you to unsubscribe to such information.

## SECURITY 

* * *

To make online giving and shopping at the Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. website a safe and secure experience, we use a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) capable browser. This means that any credit/debit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our server, making it extremely difficult for others to access your private information during transmission.

While we will make reasonable efforts to store any personal information which we hold in a secure server or in secure files, and to keep this information accurate and up-to-date, the Internet is not a secure medium for the transmission of information. Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. cannot accept responsibility for the security of information you send to or receive from us over the Internet or for any unauthorised access to or use of that information.

Unauthorised attempts to upload information to or change information on our website are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law.

## LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES 

* * *

Our website may contain links to other websites. Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of these other websites. Should you choose to follow a link to another website, you are subject to its privacy policy.

## VARIATION 

* * *

Joseph Prince Ministries, Inc. may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to visit our website regularly to stay updated of these changes.
