# Privacy Policy and Security

At JournalismJobs.com, your personal privacy and security is very important to us. We will do everything we can to ensure the information you submit to us remains confidential and secure. Below is information about our commitment to you:

1\. We do not read your private online communications.

2\. We do not release your postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other personal information to a third party.

3\. We do not sell, distribute or make available any personal information about you to other companies to use in advertising or marketing efforts.

4\. We do not share information entered into our databases with other Internet job sites or employment agencies. This includes resumes, cover letters, jobs, internships, fellowships, calendar events and other material.

5\. We do not let users view your online resume unless you authorize us to do so. We give users two options when storing their resume on our site: they can make it "private"or "public." A private resume is not searchable in our database and is available only to member companies to which you apply. A public resume is searchable by bonafide employers actively looking for employees. Employers, on the other hand, can remain anonymous by leaving the company name and web site lines blank in the "Job Information" section on the "Post Your Job" page.

6\. We provide a high-level of security for your personal files, correspondence and account information. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy commitment, please send an e-mail to: [contact@journalismjobs.com](mailto:contact@journalismjobs.com).
