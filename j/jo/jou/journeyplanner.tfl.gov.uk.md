Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA)

For the purpose of congestion charging, we may verify eligibility for discounts with third parties - for example, authorities issuing Blue Badges and residents' parking permits.  
If a person in receipt of a penalty charge tells us that they were not the registered keeper of the vehicle at the time a penalty charge was incurred, we will ask them to supply the details of the person who was the keeper at that time.

When we collect personal data from you, TfL will tell you if we would like to send you information about our products and services and transport related issues and give you the opportunity to not receive this information (i.e. opt out). If we intend to share your data with third parties for marketing purposes, we will tell you about this and only do so if you have given your consent (i.e. opt in).You may also tell us at any time that you no longer wish to receive this information (our contact details are given below).  
TfL may use your data in an annonmised form to carry out analysis of travel patterns, traffic monitoring and management.  
**Security**  
TfL take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your personal data are processed securely.

**Cookies:**  
**What are cookies and why do they matter?**  
Cookies are a mechanism that gives a web site a memory and so are used in an array of circumstances including as an intrinsic part of web site functionality, for example:  
·They are used by content management software to keep track of users as they move around a site so they can be served the correct pages in the correct order.   
· E-commerce tools use them to remember what items someone has put in their shopping basket.   
· Media web-sites that carry banner advertising also use cookies as part of their advertising management software. This allows the software to rotate advertisements each user sees between page requests. Such cookies last for a session.   
\- Online market research methods may use 'anonymous session trackers' to identify the user's IP address - ensuring the user is exposed to a research survey page once only and assisting in ensuring that a sample of responses representative of theuser base is gathered.  
\- In this way two, three or more cookies may be served with every page viewed. These cookies tend to expire very quickly, usually within seconds, sometimes at the end of a user's session.  
\- Other cookies are used that persist on someone's PC for up to 35 years. These so-called 'persistent cookies' are used because cookies are far more reliable than IP addresses in tracking individuals over time. The cookie is used as an ID tag to recognise the user's computer each time they return and as they browse their way through the web site.

**How do we use cookies?**  
TfL's websites do not usually use any cookies. From time to time cookies may be used for purposes such as undertaking online surveys (a cookie could be placed on a person's computer when undertaking the survey to ensure that they are not asked to do so again). Session cookies (that do not persist after the session has ended) may be used where necessary for the functionality of our websites.
