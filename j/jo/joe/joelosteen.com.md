### Here's Why We Place A Cookie On Your Hard Drive

Lakewood.cc uses a feature of your Internet Web browser that is called a "cookie." A "cookie" is a file that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. When you initially log on to Lakewood.cc, we create a "cookie" for your computer and then use it to track your clicks as you go through the Web site.
