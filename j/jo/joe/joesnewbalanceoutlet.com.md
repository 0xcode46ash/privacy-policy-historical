# Joe's New Balance Outlet - Privacy and Security

Thank you for placing your trust in Joe's New Balance Outlet. We are committed to respecting your privacy and security of your personal information. You are very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your information and gives you choices as to how we use it. The Privacy Policy applies to "www.shopnewbalance.com" and "www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com" (collectively, "the sites") operated by NB Web Express, LLC, wholly-owned by New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. By using the sites and providing your contact information, you consent to our privacy policy. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we will update and change it from time to time. This policy was last updated October 2010.

**What information does Joe's New Balance Outlet collect about me?**  
Like most websites, every time you visit our site, we automatically collect information from you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include:

  * The type of Internet browser you are using 
  * The type of computer operating system you are using
  * The domain name of your Internet service provider
  * Your IP address
  * The Web page from which you came
  * The pages you visit on our web site

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. 

When you purchase from Joe's New Balance Outlet or request to signup for e-mail or direct mail notices, we collect information that you volunteer such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, gender, and when necessary credit card information or other information necessary to process your order or send you special announcements. Your provision of this information is entirely voluntary; however, if you elect not to provide this personal information, some of the services on the sites may not be available for your use.

We also collect the information you provide to us when you register for "My Account", participate in a contest, event or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey, or contact us (for example via e-mail, "Ask the Expert".)

**How do you use my information?**  
The information we receive allows us to personalize our product offering and improve your online shopping experience, making it more convenient, efficient and enjoyable. We may use the information we collect to:

  * Customize your communications and shopping experience 
  * Process your purchase, confirm your orders and communicate to you about account information or customer service needs 
  * Adapt the content and layout of our pages tailored to your needs and so you do not have to enter information more than once
  * Notify you about new products and services, special offerings and other promotions 
  * Coordinate contests, promotions, surveys or other website features 
  * Improve our business and better respond to your needs 



**How do you share my information?**  
For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between our preferred service providers and New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. who use that information only to conduct Joe's New Balance Outlet business. For example, they may handle Joe's New Balance Outlet credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We provide our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information.

We may provide your information to New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. wholly-owned companies and affiliates such as Aravon and Dunham. We may provide information for purposes such as reporting and marketing.

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

We will not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it's possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect.

**How do I know my information is secure?**  
We have a variety of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. To ensure the information you provide online is secure during transmission, we use leading edge encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) while processing any personal information you supply.

These controls are certified by VeriSignÂ®, a leading Internet security company. You can review our security certificate using your browser by clicking on the closed lock or solid key image at the bottom of your browser on any of the secure pages on our site. This will display our site security information.

For security purposes, your full credit card number is not permanently stored within our system. On occasion, we may temporarily store the entire encrypted credit card number when it is necessary to manually contact a credit card company for verification. 

This site is also tested and certified daily to pass the McAfee Secure Security Scan. To help address concerns about hacker access to confidential data, the "live" McAfee Hacker Safe Secure mark appears only when a web site meets the McAfee Secure standard. Research indicates sites remotely scanned for known vulnerabilities on a daily basis, such as those earning McAfee Secure certification, can prevent over 99% of hacker crime.
