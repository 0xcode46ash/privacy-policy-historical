The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for joesnewbalanceoutlet.com.

**What do we do with the information we collect?**  
**Joe's New Balance Outlet does not sell, rent or loan information regarding its customers to any third party.**  
We use the information you provide us to process your order. If necessary we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS, USPS, New Balance) strictly to process and ship your order. If you choose to create an account, we use your information to enhance and accelerate your shopping experience on Joe's New Balance Outlet.  
**What information do we collect?**  
We collect general information as you browse our site to help us diagnose problems with our server, administer our web site, and analyze broad demographic information about our visitors. The following information is obtained: 

  * IP Address - We use IP addresses to measure site traffic and help provide relevant shopping experiences. Your IP address is not linked to your customer information.
  * Referral Site - If you come to our site via a link, the location of the referral is captured. This is to help us know where our customers come from.
  * Browser Type - This information is captured to help us optimize our site to match the latest technology used by our customers.

If ordering, we collect information that is relevant to processing an order, such as customer and shipping information and payment information. For your security, we do not save your payment information for future purchases.   
**How do we collect the information?**  
Our site uses secure order forms for customers to order products. These order forms allow us to obtain contact information (email, address, & phone number) and payment information (credit card number). This information is used to confirm your order and respond to any questions you may have. Joe's New Balance Outlet does reserve the right to sell customer data in conjunction with a sale of the company or any of its assets. 

We allow customers to maintain "My Account" information to aid in the input of future orders. The "My Account" information contains contact, shipping and order history information, but for your security we do not maintain payment information within "My Account". The "My Account" feature is optional and available during the order process. You may update the information in "My Account" at any time by signing in to "My Account" and following the instructions. 

Lastly, to improve our services to you we may from time to time request some of our customers to complete a voluntary survey. Survey answers are confidential. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.

Cookies  
---  
To function optimally, Joe's New Balance Outlet requires that your browser accepts **_cookies_**.  
**How we use cookies?**  
  
In order to provide our customers with powerful functionality, we developed our site using Microsoft's Active Server Page Technology (ASP). One of the benefits of using ASP is that we are able to temporarily store information about your visit (i.e. items in your shopping cart, sizes you have selected...) on our server. This is far more efficient than passing information back and forth over the internet between our server and your browser.

To keep track of your selections and items, a unique session number is assigned every time you access our site. Then, by using cookies, ASP keeps track of the items you have added to your shopping cart based on the unique session number assigned to you.  
  
**How do cookies work?**  
  
Cookies are files containing bits of text information which our server sends to your computer and vice versa (exactly like all other information you receive when surfing the net, except it is not displayed). This allows our server to communicate with your browser and keep track of your unique shopping selections. The text information on your cookie correlates with the unique session number assigned to you when first accessing our site.

First and foremost, **cookies are harmless**. Cookies are small strings of text and nothing more. They are not capable of doing anything malicious to your computer, and cannot be read by any site other than the site which originally delivered the cookie. Cookies do not contain any information _retrieved_ from your computer, they only contain information supplied by you regarding your specific visit to the site sending the cookie.
