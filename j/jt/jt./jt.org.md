# Privacy Policy | 855-734-2231 Privacy Information from Comcast

The information Bridgevine collects about you at our websites, and the subdomains thereof (the "Sites" or "Websites") is used to administer the Website and to provide information to Website visitors about the Site’s various services and tools, and to provide general news, information, entertainment and ecommerce capability. Bridgevine, together with Bridgevine partners and operators, are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we," "us," "our" or other similar pronouns, or "Bridgevine."

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**  
This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the Website, whether accessed through mobile or desktop applications, or otherwise. Â Except as otherwise provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not govern Bridgevine’s treatment of information it collects and receives about you other than through this Website, for example in connection with any other services provided to you by Bridgevine. 

This Privacy Policy covers how Bridgevine treats information that Bridgevine collects and receives about you via this Website, or in e-mail, text or other electronic messages between you and the Website, and including the personal information we collect through the various features, services, and software that we use to provide the Site to you. Â It does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application, feature, service, software or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.Â  If you choose to take advantage of any third party offerings, you should read the privacy policies of such third parties.

**How Does Bridgevine Collect and Use Information About You?**  
The information learned from this Website's users will help Bridgevine provide an enhanced online experience for its subscribers. Bridgevine tracks certain information about users (as further described below), including, but not limited to, the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., Bridgevine Internet). By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's preferences are automatically made available to that visitor. 

Personally identifiable data (as further described below) about visitors to this Site are collected by Bridgevine, for example, when users register or subscribe for newsletters, accounts or features, change services or service settings on our Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, message board, blog, or other similar open forum on our Website, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website, or send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit personal information to us via our Website.

We may use your personally identifiable information to send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you, unless you choose to opt-out of these mailings (as described below).

Bridgevine sites (other than this Site), as well as any other third party sites linked to from this Site, may each have different privacy policies and practices. Bridgevine is not responsible for the information practices of non-Bridgevine sites, or channels or areas of this Site, that are operated by third parties. You should carefully review these other privacy policies in order to determine how each third party may use any personal information you provide.

Bridgevine does send product marketing e-mail. We use your e-mail address which may be entered for service qualifying order placement or via other email capture methods.

By clicking on the "Opt Out" link, you will have removed your e-mail address from our mailing list, and you will not receive any further product marketing communications from Bridgevine. 

This site gives users the following options for notifying Bridgevine of their choice not to receive future communications from us or our partners; or to no longer receive our service.

Here are the types of information Bridgevine gathers and how this information is used:

  
**Website Usage Information**  
Bridgevine receives and stores certain types of website usage information whenever you interact with and navigate through our Website.Â Here are the types of website usage information Bridgevine gathers and how it is used.

**Cookies**  
We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our Web site and what you look at and purchase. They may store, for example, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies (technically known as Flash “local shared objects”). However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web site or certain areas or features of the Web site.

  
**Clear GIFs**  
We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you, for example, to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.

**IP Address and Clickstream Data**  
Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider (i.e., if you are using your TWC Internet account, us) whenever you're on the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.

Ads and Content displayed to you on the Site may be customized to your interests and preferences, based on your personal information and web site usage information, including (but not limited to) non-personally identifying information, which we may obtain from you or from other sources.

Any or all of these activities with regard to web site usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

**Short Message Service**  
We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service (“SMS Service”). If you subscribe to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages at the address you provide for such purposes from Bridgevine.

Your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions on the Site or in the message you receive. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.

You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service-related complaints.

  
**Third Party Ad Services and Providers**  
We may use third-party advertising services companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (generally not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear gifs to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. Â We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.Â  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer Web site at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising>.

Bridgevine may disclose your information in any other way we may describe when you provide the information.

**Security**  
Bridgevine will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive information provided to this Site.

**Do Not Call List Information**  
Effective October 3, 2003, new telemarketing rules went into effect as promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission for the National Do Not Call Registry. If the person has not made a previous request, an outbound telemarketing call still may not be made if the person's number is on the "do-not-call" registry. 16 C.F.R. 310(b)(1)(iii)(B). There are two exceptions to the prohibition against calling a person on the "do-not-call" registry: (1) express agreement, in writing, including the telephone number to which calls may be placed and the signature of that person (which may include an electronic or digital signature), 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(i); (2) the seller has an "established business relationship" with the person and the person has not previously made a specific objection to receiving a call by or on behalf of the seller.

The FTC rules further define an "established business relationship" as including a "relationship between a seller and a consumer based on:â€¦ (2) the consumer's inquiry or application regarding a product or service offered by the seller, within the three (3) months immediately preceding the date of a telemarketing call." 16 C.F.R. 310.2(n)(2). 

A seller cannot call a person who has "previously stated that he or she does not wish to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller whose goods or services are being offered." 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(A).
