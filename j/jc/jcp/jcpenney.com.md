# privacy policy - JCPenney

Secure Socket Layering (SSL) technology is used to encrypt your credit or debit card information, including the account number, while it is transmitted over the Internet from your computer.  SSL is an industry standard technology for secure online transactions.

**unauthorized charges**

If unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit or debit card as a result of purchases made on jcp.com utilizing our secure servers, JCPenney will reimburse you for up to $50 of any amounts you are required to pay by the card issuer. Also, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but many debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards as well.

  
Remember:  In the event of unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.  
 

**our use of cookies and  other technologies**

****cookies -** **We and our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site (whether through the Internet or mobile applications).  Cookies also allow us and our service providers to understand how you clicked to our site and what pages you click on during your visit to our site, as well as how you use our mobile applications. Knowing how you prefer to shop allows us to improve your shopping experience and speed your checkout process.

A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or device. When you arrive at jcp.com, cookies allow us to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie associated with the information that you as a customer have provided us. If you register with us at jcp.com, your e-mail address is saved in your cookie. We do not store your name (unless it is part of your email address), street address or credit card number in your cookie.  

Accepting cookies through your web browser is your personal choice. If you use the privacy settings on your web browser to disable cookies, you can still browse jcp.com, but you may not have as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs. However, if you block cookies you will not be able to make a purchase on jcp.com.

**web beacons -** A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on web site pages and in emails and other marketing communications that allows us and our service providers to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access those pages or open email messages and other marketing communications, the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  That information is used to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site or mobile applications, and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail advertising and  other marketing communications. Our contracts with our service providers require them to limit their use of such information to the purposes authorized by us.  

**flash cookies  –  **A Flash cookie (also known as a Local Shared Object) is a data file stored on your computer by the websites you visit using Adobe Flash technology, and is persistent. We or our service providers may use Flash cookies to enable or control Flash-based content and for other uses similar to those provided by the cookies discussed earlier in this section. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies.  You can manage the use of Flash cookies via the Settings Manager on Adobe’s website at <http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html>.  You may also be able to manage them through your browser, depending on the version of the browser.

        ** **analytics services** - ** JCPenney uses third party analytics companies, such as IBM Digital Analytics and Google Analytics, on its website. These companies collect and analyze information about how people use our site, including information about browsing and buying activities on jcp.com. To perform some of these services, they may collect and use information from first- and third-party cookies. In addition, Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics also provide services that analyze information regarding visits to certain portions of jcp.com that are operated for JCPenney by third parties, such as our Bali and Levolor blinds and shades pages, and personalized jewelry pages. They use cookies and web beacons to collect this information..

**technology used to serve  advertising** – We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (e.g. banners or links) tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop on jcp.com and other sites over time, and to perform tracking and reporting functions with respect to our ads. We also allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our site and to use that information to serve ads for JCPenney products or services, or the products or services of other companies when you visit our site or other sites. For instance, we and third-party vendors, such as Google, use first- and third-party cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to inform, optimize and serve ads based upon a user’s past visits to our website and to report upon how our ad impressions and other ad services are related to jcp.com.  We may combine and associate the information we collect through these technologies with other information we have collected from and about you. This collective information may be used, among other things, for interest-based advertising (also called “online behavioral advertising”) in order to personalize your online experience, improve our website, evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising, and to tailor our marketing to you.

At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt-out of interest-based advertising, as well as the other choices described in the “your choices regarding the use of information we collect” section of this policy. 

To learn more about interest-based advertising and how to “opt-out” of interest based advertising programs from participating companies, please go to the Network Advertising Initiative website at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> or the Digital Advertising Alliance website at <http://www.aboutads.info/>. Please note that the opt-outs you make on one or both of those websites only apply to the receipt of interest-based advertising from participating companies.  You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating companies, and the websites you visit may still collect information for other purposes. Also, your opt-out status will be maintained by placement of an “opt-out” cookie on your computer.  If the cookie is removed or deleted, or you upgrade to a new version of your browser, change browsers or visit us from a different computer or device, you will need to repeat this process to indicate your opt-out preference

JCPenney has contracted with Borderfree, Inc. (“Borderfree”) to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of online purchases that our customers choose to ship internationally (an “international order”).

When you place an international order, you will submit personal information (e.g. your name, email address, billing address, and shipping address) and other order-related information to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  If you also choose to create a jcp.com account, any personal information you provide will also be transferred to JCPenney through and to servers located in the United States.  Please note that United States law may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the laws in your home country.  This privacy policy applies to any personal information you furnish JCPenney in connection with international orders, your jcp.com account or otherwise.

JCPenney will then share your international order information, including personal information about you, with Borderfree for the purpose of facilitating ordering and shipping internationally.  Borderfree  will process personal information about you in accordance with its [privacy policy. ](http://www.fiftyone.com/privacy) Borderfree has agreed not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international orders and shipments.

By placing an international order, you acknowledge and agree that jcp will transfer personal information about you to Borderfree, and acknowledge that your financial transaction and shipment will be processed by Borderfree.  During the checkout process, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.  You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.

Once your order is approved, JCPenney will ship it to Borderfree.  Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product(s) you ordered from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities and arrange for the product(s) to be delivered to you.  In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. 

Customers shipping internationally who wish to:

  * Inquire about or update their personal information,
  * Make a complaint about the collection or use of their personal information, or
  * Comment on or ask questions regarding this privacy policy,
