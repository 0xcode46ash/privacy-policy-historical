J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Privacy Policy (rev. 01/31/12)  
  
---  
 

The following Privacy Policy describes the information and privacy practices for jcp retail stores and jcp.com

See "Changes To This Policy" for a description of the most recent revisions.   
  
At jcpenney Your Privacy Is A Priority  
---  
  
We value the trust you place in jcpenney.  Accordingly, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.   
  
The Information We Collect  
---  
  
Whenever you shop in our stores, or at jcp.com, we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, birth date, and email address.  If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, it will include your account number. 

If you register with jcp.com or sign up to receive mobile or email updates from jcpenney, we will collect the information you submit.

If you choose to use or participate in one of our various services, promotions, programs, surveys, sweepstakes or clubs, we may collect additional information about you.

From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.

We may also obtain information about other people from you. For example, if you order a gift to be delivered directly to a friend, you would need to give us the friend’s name and address.   
  
We receive information from other companies. For example, if you have a jcpenney credit card, we receive application and account information from GE Capital Retail Bank (GECRB), the company that owns and administers jcpenney credit accounts (see the "Your jcpenney Credit Account" section of this policy for additional information).

We also collect consumer information from third-party providers in order to improve the accuracy of our customer database or increase our understanding of our customers. For example, we get updated addresses from the National Change of Address (NCOA) service, licensed by the U.S. Postal Service, to assist us in having the correct addresses for our customers.   
 

We work with certain websites to present advertising to known groups of our customers when they visit those websites. This practice, referred to as "data matching" is facilitated by a third-party service provider for jcpenney and the advertising website. This practice avoids direct sharing of any personal data with the advertising website. Data received back through this process is used to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising to groups of customers. 

 

| Using The Information We Collect  
---  
  
We use the information we collect for various purposes, including: 

  * completing your purchase transactions
  * providing the services you request
  * contacting you about the status of your store or jcp.com orders
  * responding to your customer service inquiries or requests
  * notifying you of product recalls or providing other information concerning products you have purchased
  * helping to protect against fraudulent use of your personal information
  * sending you direct mail updates
  * sending you email communications
  * administering customer recognition programs, sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions
  * identifying your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you
  * providing mobile marketing and service messages when requested
  * inviting you to participate in surveys
  * improving merchandise selections, customer service, and the overall customer shopping experience 

  
  
Information We Share With Others  
---  
  
jcpenney Family:  We share information we collect with affiliated companies and licensees (like the optical and photography departments in jcpenney retail stores) within the jcpenney family of businesses. 

Service Providers:  We provide information to other companies that provide support services that help us bring you the products and services we offer, market our products and services, or process your transactions. We also provide information to GECRB and other service providers in connection with the jcpenney credit programs.

Third-Party Offers:  We provide information to responsible outside companies. These carefully selected companies may use the information we share to let you know about their products or services, which may include providing special offers to you.

Promotion Sponsors:  If you enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion sponsored or co-sponsored by a third-party company, we may forward information about you to that company.

Others:  On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose the information we collect pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We may also disclose that information when we believe disclosure is appropriate to protect the rights, interests and property of jcpenney or others, and to protect the safety of customers, associates or others. This may include sharing information with other companies, attorneys, credit bureaus, agents or governmental agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection. Also, if the ownership of all or part of a business within the jcp family were to change, information about customers pertinent to that business’s operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. The applicable member of the jcp family might also retain a copy of that information.    


   
  
Safeguarding The Information We Collect  
---  
  
Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, protecting your personal information is important to us.  We have appropriate physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place to secure the personal information we collect from you.   


We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you their products and services.  We contractually require that they have appropriate information security safeguards, and that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose.

Additional Information About jcp.com  
  
 **  
Online Security**

Secure Socket Layering (SSL) technology is used to encrypt your credit or debit card information, including the account number, while it is transmitted over the Internet from your computer.  SSL is an industry standard technology for secure online transactions.

 **Unauthorized Charges**

If unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit or debit card as a result of purchases made on jcp.com utilizing our secure servers, jcpenney will reimburse you for up to $50 of any amounts you are required to pay by the card issuer. Also, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card provider cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but many debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards as well.

Remember:  In the event of unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.   
 

 **Our Use Of Cookies And Web Beacon Technologies**

 **Cookies -** We or our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site. A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer. When you arrive at jcp.com, cookies allow us to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie with the information that you as a customer have provided us. If you register with us at jcp.com, your e-mail address is saved in your cookie. We do not store your name (unless it is part of your email address), street address or credit card number in your cookie.

Cookies allow us and our service providers to understand how you clicked to our site and what pages you click on during your visit to our site. Knowing how you prefer to shop allows us to improve your shopping experience and speed your checkout process.  

Accepting cookies through your web browser is your personal choice. If you use the privacy settings on your web browser to disable cookies, you can still browse jcp.com, but you may not have as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs. However, if you block cookies you will not be able to make a purchase on jcp.com.  
  
 **Web Beacons** - A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on web site pages or in our emails that allows us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access those pages or open email messages, the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  We use that information to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail advertising. jcpenney uses service providers to assist in the collection and analysis of this information.  The service providers that assist us with our e-mail advertising may access your e-mail address through these web beacons in connection with the services they perform for us.  For example, they may look to see if you received an email message from us prior to making a purchase on jcp.com.  Our contracts with our service providers require them to limit their use of such information to the purposes authorized by us.  

 **Coremetrics –**   Coremetrics furnishes services to jcpenney that assist in the collection and analysis of your browsing and buying activity on jcp.com.  To perform some of these analytical services, Coremetrics collects information from a cookie placed by jcp.com.  You may choose to opt-out from this data collection.  Your choices with respect to this data collection are set forth below.  The Anonymous Visitor setting will apply to you unless you choose to opt-out.

In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed on or recognized by your browser. In addition, we may use web beacons, provided by third-party advertising companies, to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits our site and to learn which advertising brings visitors to jcp.com.  To learn more about these third party advertising practices, cookies, and how to “opt-out” of online behavioral advertising programs run by members of the Network Advertising Initiative, please go to [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp?) If you opt-out, you may continue to see or receive online advertising from jcpenney, however, this advertising may not be as relevant to you.
