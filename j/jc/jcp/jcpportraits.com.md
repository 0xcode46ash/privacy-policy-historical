### **What information is collected at jcpportraits.com? How is it used?**

Your personal information. At jcpportraits.com, we only collect personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically provide it to us. This includes, for example, the information you provide when you place an order, register for a service, respond to a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes online. We may also receive information from other companies. We use the information you share with us

  * to provide the products or services or benefits you request

  * to improve the content of our site and its usefulness to you
  * for marketing and promotional purposes.



We may share this information among JCPenney Company, Inc., Lifetouch Inc. and their affiliated companies (the "Affiliated Companies") and you may receive product and service information from any of them. In addition, we may share this information with third parties that we believe are reputable in order to offer products and services that may be of interest to you. Finally, we may share this information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us or that help us with our marketing programs. We may also provide this information as required by law.

In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which we may share or transfer the information in our databases, for example, to respond to judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or Web site, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.

### **Safeguarding information**

Within the Affiliated Companies, we protect against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access to employees and contractors of the Affiliated Companies who need the information to do their jobs. We also give them clear guidelines for adhering to our confidentiality policies.

We limit the information we provide to outside companies to only the information we believe is appropriate to enable them to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts or to offer you products and services we think might be of interest to you. We contractually require that the information provided be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained.
