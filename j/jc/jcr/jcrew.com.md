Any personal information you provide to us on our web site is maintained in private files on our secure Web server and our internal systems. We collect information when you register or update your account, log-in, place an order, opt-in to receive our emails, shop online, request a catalog, or participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey. This information may include, but is not limited to, name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information and phone number. If you create an account, you also have the option of providing your product preferences and demographic information. If you use our 'email this style to a friend' functionality found on all product pages, we will also collect your friend's name and email address. This information is only used to send the forwarding email and is not saved in our customer or marketing databases.   
   
J.Crew will not sell, rent or share your email address with third parties to send you unsolicited email. However, in our ongoing effort to provide you with the best service possible, we may share your information with our family of brands and/or affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell) for their use. 

When you supply your postal address, either when requesting a catalog or placing an order, you may receive a catalog by mail from J.Crew or one of our other brands or affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell). We occasionally make our postal list available for limited use by a few reputable and carefully screened firms, but at your request, we will not share your address with anyone. Requests can be sent to [contactus@jcrew.com](mailto:contactus@jcrew.com). 

When you place an order on jcrew.com, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order and shipping confirmation emails. 

We also maintain a record of your purchases made on jcrew.com and through our J. Crew family of websites (including crewcutkids.com and madewell1937.com) and combine this with information you have provided in our retail stores or over the phone in order to serve you better. We may combine information you provide with demographic information, information gathered from our other brands and affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell), and information that is publicly available. We may also use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve our site design and enhance your shopping experience. 

When we offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional obligations. In these instances, you have the option to receive emails or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. Even if you have previously chosen not to receive email or postal mail from us, you may still receive information as it relates to the sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey in which you have participated. 

In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, J.Crew may disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. 

You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our web site or the public.   
  
   
At various points on our site you have the option to join our email list and receive information about our products, services and offers. Also, if you provide us with your email address either on the home page, when you register, place an order, enter a contest or during checkout, you may automatically be added to our email list and receive marketing or promotional information from us or one of our other brands or affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell). If you do not wish to receive J.Crew or crewcuts marketing emails, you may opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of all J.Crew or crewcuts marketing emails, or you may [click here](http://www.jcrew.com/pages/common/EmailDeleteForm.jhtml). You can also email customer service at [contactus@jcrew.com](mailto:contactus@jcrew.com) or call 800-562-0258. You can also request removal via postal mail by writing to:

J.Crew Customer Relations  
One Ivy Crescent  
Lynchburg, VA 24513-1001

If you do not wish to receive Madewell marketing emails, you may opt-out by emailing [unsubscribe@madewell1937.com](mailto:unsubscribe@madewell1937.com). 

Please be aware that it can take up to 10 business days to remove you from our marketing email lists. If you opt-out from our marketing emails, you will continue to receive order and shipping confirmation emails and all other emails relating to your order(s).   
  
   
J.Crew works with reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf. Sometimes these service providers need information about our customers in order to do their jobs, such as fulfill orders and promotions, maintain and manage our customer database and report on customer behavior and/or preferences. When J.Crew allows these service providers access to your information, we require them to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and do not permit them to use it in any way other than to help us provide you with better service. 

We currently use the services of a few carefully selected marketing companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. These companies help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, cookies and web beacons are placed on our web site on our behalf. The type of information we collect includes pages visited, products viewed and products placed in your shopping cart. By supplementing our records, this information enables us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization. If you prefer us not to have your information included in our ongoing site analysis to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt out" by [clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product). 

In addition, we may share statistical, demographic and other non-personally identifiable information with third party companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. 

If you are visiting jcrew.com through YourShops.ca, information about your visit through the jcrew.com pages and your online shopping experience will be accessed by YourShops.ca. We encourage you to review the YourShops.ca privacy policy at <http://www.yourshops.ca/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=VirtualRetail/Privacy>.   
  
   
Personal information relating to you and your order history is only available to you if you provide the correct password that you create. After providing your password, you can edit or delete your information at any time through the 'my account' page. 

If you forget your password, you can request that it be emailed to your email address. We will not give passwords out over the phone, nor will we email them to a different email address than the one used to register. If you request to have your password emailed to you, your credit card information will be deleted from your profile. 

Your address book, located in the 'my account' page, is your personal storage space. We do not use the names of the people in your address book to send email promotions or catalogs by mail. 

When you enter names in your address book, they will be accessible on your computer to place orders whether you are logged in or not. If you are using a public computer, please click on the link on your order confirmation page that prompts you to 'click here to clear all information' after placing your order to maximize privacy.   
  
   
To enhance your shopping experience, the J.Crew site may have links to other sites. Those Web sites will have their own policies on privacy that you may wish to review. J.Crew has no responsibility for these linked Web sites.   
   
Cookies are bits of information that we automatically store on your computer if your computer accepts cookies. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your name, address or any financial information on your computer. We use cookies to recognize you and your preferences to make shopping easier and provide you with a customized experience on our web site. J.Crew places a unique user ID number on your cookie which allows us to access information that will improve your shopping experience, such as holding items in your shopping bag, accessing your address book, or providing you with customized pages based on your past viewing or purchasing preferences. We also use cookies to track traffic to different parts of our web site in order to make improvements and optimize your shopping experience. 

If you do not wish to have a cookie on your system, you can set your browser preferences to refuse them. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions.

Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a web page. They are sometimes called "clear GIFs" (Graphics Interchange Format) or "pixel tags". Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies to monitor activity on our web site. When you visit a particular web page, web beacons notify us of your visit. Since web beacons are used in combination with cookies, if you disable cookies the web beacon will only detect an anonymous web site visit.

  * The phrase "no catalog" in the subject line 
  * Your name and your complete mailing address 
  * The ID# in the gray box above your name on the back of the catalog. (We can process your request without this number, but including it will completely ensure that you are removed.)

J.Crew is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13. We do not sell products for purchase by children and all children's products we sell are for purchase by adults only.   
   
The security of your information is very important to us. We use 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than J.Crew. 

Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following: 

  * The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https" 
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser window. 

Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through the J.Crew web site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page. Click here for more detailed instructions. 

While we implement these and other security measures on our site, please note that 100% security is not always possible.
