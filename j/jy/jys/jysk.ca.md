# Privacy Policy

JYSK collects two types of information: personal information and non-personal information.

With your consent, we may use your personal information for many different purposes, for example:

  * Fulfill requests for products, services or information;
  * Provide customer service;
  * Offer new products and services; and
  * Tailor our online or retail store offerings to your preferences.



We only collect personal information from you when you voluntarily offer the information, such as when signing up for online newsletters or when you set up an account with us.

Personal information provided when you subscribe to the JYSK Mail newsletter is only used to deliver the JYSK Mail newsletter to your e-mail account and maintain the accuracy of your information. If you wish to unsubscribe, please click the unsubscribe option that appears at the bottom of every JYSK Mail.

When placing an order with us, your credit card information is encrypted using SSL protocol and sent directly to our credit card processing company, Eigen Development Ltd., where it is only stored until the completion of your transaction. You are able to modify all personal information that is stored after the completion of an online transaction by logging into your account.

Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. Like many other web sites, we automatically collect some non-personal information such as the website pages visited, the images that are viewed, the content that you download from the website, which website you used to connected to our website and the date and time you access the website. We use this information to track website traffic patterns which enables us to know what type of information is most useful to you so that we can improve our website and make it easier for you to access information.
