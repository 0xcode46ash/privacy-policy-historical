This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for[JBonamassa.com](http://jbonamassa.com/ "JBonamassa.com"). This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:

**Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**

We are the sole owners of any and all information collected. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via submitting data in to a web form. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone outside of J&R Adventures and its subsidiaries.

We will use your information to provide you with our official newsletters and/or other information. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfil your request, e.g. to ship an order. We may contact you via email in the future to tell you about Joe Bonamassa, Tribut Apparel, upcoming concerts, specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

We use Google AdWords conversion tracking to measure our ad performance on some of our landing pages. We do not share this information with anyone for any reason.

**Your Access to and Control Over Information**  
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link provided in any of our email contacts to you. Once you unsubscribe from one of our lists, you automatically unsubscribe from all other lists, regardless of when and where you provided your email.  
You have a right at any time to request the following:

  * See what data we have about you, if any.
  * Change/correct any data we have about you.
  * Have us delete any data we have about you.
  * Express any concern you have about our use of your data.



**Security**  
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

In the case of ecommerce, wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.
