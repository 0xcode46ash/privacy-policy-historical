If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does **not** identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit: 

  1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site; 
  2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site, including extended information including, but not limited to, your screen size and other metrics; 
  3. The date and time you access our site;

We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do **not** track or record information about individuals and their visits.

##  If You Send Us Personal Information 

If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an e-mail, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our Web site, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us provide you with information that you request. Under no circumstances will we sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information. 

##  Disclosure 

We may be required by law to disclose the information, or may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service you have requested, for example, if you purchase products online from our store, we may need to disclose your personal information to third parties in order to bill and deliver your products.

Otherwise than stated above, we do not disclose personal information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any other organisation _unless you have authorised us to do so_.

##  Online Services 

There are several interactive features on this Web site, including the Forums, that require the storage of personal data. 

When interacting with this Web site, we suggest that you use your discretion and exercise caution when providing your personal information. 

Note that whenever you post personal information in publicly accessible places, such as article comments or the Forums, this information becomes available to anyone with access to the internet. This information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Therefore, we recommend that you refrain from posting any information that you do not want seen in these public areas. For example, when participating in the Forums, your name will appear on the message board. We recommend that applicants registering online do not use their real names, but a pen name or pseudonym. You must not intentionally use the name of another living person. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any personal information. Be responsible whenever you are online. 

##  Complaints 

If you have any complaints relating to online privacy issues on our Web site, please use our Contact form. While JXtended accepts no liability for any material or links posted to the service, we will investigate all complaints.
