# JPAY.com - Helping families help inmates.

|  Jpay.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting Jpay.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice**. 

**What Personal Information About Customers Does Jpay.com Gather?**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve our service at Jpay.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of certain of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as providing our service, responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our service, and communicating with you. 
  * **E-mail Communications:** After the inmate's account is credited, we will email you a confirmation of your deposit.



**Does Jpay.com Share the Information It Receives?**  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with our parent organization, WFNS Payment Services LLC and as described below. 

  * **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering monies, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Jpay.com, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021003223829id_/http%3A//www.jpay.com/policies.html) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Jpay.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



**How Secure Is Information About Me?**  


  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 



**What Choices Do I Have?**  


  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Jpay.com features. 
  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please email our [Customer Assistance](https://web.archive.org/web/20021003223829id_/http%3A//www.jpay.com/customer.html) department. (If you do not want to receive [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021003223829id_/http%3A//www.jpay.com/policies.html) and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Jpay.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 



**Children**  
Jpay.com does not provide its services to children. If you are under 18, you may use Jpay.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**  
If you choose to visit Jpay.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Notice and our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021003223829id_/http%3A//www.jpay.com/policies.html), including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Ohio. If you have any concern about privacy at Jpay.com, please send us a thorough description to [feedback@jpay.com](mailto:feedback@jpay.com), and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021003223829id_/http%3A//www.jpay.com/policies.html) will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. 

**Information You Give Us By Using Our Service**  
You will be prompted to enter all required information by the merchant bank in order to complete a credit card transaction. Additionally, we will ask for the name and the book/case number of the inmate who will receive the deposit.
