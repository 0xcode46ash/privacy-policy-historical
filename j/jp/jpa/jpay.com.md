This Privacy Policy governs your JPay account and any information you provide on this site. In order to use the JPay service and to reduce the risk of fraud, JPay requires you to provide information about yourself and your credit card and/or debit card (“Bank card”). JPay is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be collected and used by JPay. This policy may change from time to time, so please check it periodically.   
  
  
INFORMATION WE COLLECT  
  
If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence and incorporate the information it contains into our database. Information provided by you to open a JPay account, such as your name, address, phone number, and Bank card information are retained in the JPay database. Additional information concerning each transaction, such as the amount of the transaction or inmate information such as inmate’s ID or inmate’s last name, are also stored in the JPay database. 

We ask for your email address to serve as your username. We will only use your email address to notify you of any service announcements related to your account. We do not send out any newsletter or promotional emails. 

Every time someone visits our web site a log file is generated on our computer. This contains information such as the user's IP (Internet Protocol) address, how long that user spent on the site, and which pages of the Web site they visited. We collect this information to help us diagnose problems and administer our systems, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site (e.g. what part of the world users are connecting from, or what ISPs are being used). 

We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our User Agreement, or to protect our services and other users, and respond to law enforcement. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.   
  
COOKIES  
  
Cookies are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a JPay customer if you return to the JPay site using the same computer and browser. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We send a session cookie to your computer if and when you log in to your JPay account by entering your email address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.   
  
  
USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  
  
In order to protect all our customers from potential fraud, we verify the information you provide us with third parties. The verification process allows JPay to collect specific information about you in order to safeguard your personal information and any information related to a transaction. In particular, if you register a Bank card with JPay, we will use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to JPay, and that the card has not been lost or stolen. Inmate information provided to us is validated against the appropriate prison inmate’s database. 

JPay will only disclose personally identifiable information to third parties under the following circumstances. JPay shares information with companies that help us process transactions such as credit card processors. These third parties are not allowed to use your information for any secondary purposes. JPay may also disclose information that we in good faith believe is necessary to investigate fraud or illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. JPay will disclose information requested by a regulatory or government authority investigating illegal activities. Similarly, we will disclose your personal information whereby our company or business assets are transferred to a third party or if we are compelled to do so by law.   
  
Business Transitions   
  
In the event JPay Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our Web site will be displayed for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.   
  
  
HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION  
  
JPay is committed to taking every necessary precaution to protect your information. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. JPay restricts access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide services for you. Your Bank card information is stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. JPay continually reviews and enhances its security systems.

There are areas of our website where you may be asked to transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number, it will be transmitted in an encrypted format using industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.   
  
HOW YOU CAN HELP US PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION  
  
Remember to close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.   
  
  
EXTERNAL LINKS  
  
This site contains links to other sites and if you decide to follow those links, JPay will not be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those Web sites.  
  
  
Changes in this Privacy Statement  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
