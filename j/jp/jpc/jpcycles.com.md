We make portions of our customer mailing lists available to carefully screened companies that offer products and services we believe you may enjoy. If you do not want to receive those offers and/or information, please let us know by contacting us. 

If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by providing us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list. 

When you visit this web site, we collect information about your visit. We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, where in our site you visit, and the length of time of your visit. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. Except where listed elsewhere in this privacy statement, we keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. This information helps us better our service by showing our peak usage, busiest times, and server needs. 

We use cookies to store information between visits to our site. Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor from one page to another. Web browsers store cookies so that the browser itself can remember some information and then, on request, pass all that information up to the server at one time. We use cookies to remember your name and the contents of your shopping cart. Our website requires the use of cookies. Turning off cookies or rejecting the jpcycles.com cookie will prevent you from making purchases from the website. The information contained in the cookies only contains information about your visit to our website, and no other personal information. We cannot and do not track your actions on any Internet locations other than the jpcycles.com web site. 

If you place an order online, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, you can opt not to get email from us except for the order confirmation we send after an order was received by us. The financial information we collect is used ONLY to bill you for products you purchase. 

We may run contests and promotions on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their email address). We use this information to contact the winners and to send visitors information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. 

J&P Cycles® is constantly striving to improve its service to you. To assist us with this process, your call to our sales and service department could be monitored (if you do not want your conversation to be monitored, just let your representative know). Our purpose for this procedure is to coach our staff to provide you with outstanding customer service. At J&P Cycles®, we believe excellence is a continuous process, not a goal. 

We will cooperate with law enforcement and judicial authorities, and we may provide personally identifiable information to appropriate government authorities upon receipt of a subpoena or court order, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we in good faith believe to be illegal.
