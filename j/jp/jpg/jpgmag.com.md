# JPG: About: Privacy policy

### Privacy policy

This privacy policy pertains to the use of the JPG website at jpgmag.com.

#### Information we collect

  * When you register an account at JPG, we ask for your email address and certain optional information, such as your name.
  * JPG automatically receives and records information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the page you request. This is normal website behavior.
  * JPG uses information for the following general purposes: billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.



##### IP addresses

IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored in our user registration databases when you register with JPG.

IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:

  * To diagnose or service technical problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
  * To estimate the total number of users visiting JPG from specific geographical regions.
  * To make sure that people are not abusing the voting or submission systems.



##### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's disk.

  * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.
  * If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use JPG services that require you to "log in" and you may not be able to take full advantage of the JPG service.
  * JPG uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including:  

    * To access your information when you "log in."
    * To keep track of preferences you specify while you are using JPG's services.
    * To display the most appropriate advertising, based on your interests and activity on JPG.
    * To estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
    * To conduct research to improve JPG's content and services.
  * JPG may let other companies (such as Google) that show advertisements on our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to JPG's cookies.



#### Information sharing and disclosure

  * When you post a photo or write a story on JPG, your username or alias that you are posting under is visible to other users.
  * If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. JPG does not rent or sell your personal information.
  * Generally, JPG does not share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies without your consent, except when compelled by subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process.
  * It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of JPG's terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if JPG is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, JPG will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the JPG website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. JPG may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly use JPG are between the ages of 18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission.



#### Editing and deleting account information

  * You can change your JPG profile information at any time, except your username which is fixed when created.
  * We may send you certain communications relating to the JPG service, such as service announcements and administrative messages.
  * You can delete your JPG account at any time via your account profile page or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact); however, please note that comments you have written on other JPG users' photos will still exist, in order to maintain discussion integrity.
  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to fulfill their job duties.
  * Your JPG profile information is password-protected.
  * In certain areas, JPG uses SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.



#### Changes to this privacy policy

JPG may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to the primary email address specified in your JPG account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
