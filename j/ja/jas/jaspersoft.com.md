None of these methods can be personally identified with you, with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Website, as described below.

Jaspersoft's software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of Jaspersoft's products.

A "cookie" is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some Jaspersoft pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on Jaspersoft Websites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so the next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so the next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Jaspersoft does not require that you accept cookies.
