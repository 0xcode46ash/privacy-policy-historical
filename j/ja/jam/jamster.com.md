**NOTICE** : JAMSTER WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES 

When you voluntarily provide PII to Jamster, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Jamster will make of the information. 

At the time you provide your PII , Jamster will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). 

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your PII, provided you have given Jamster permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us. 

Jamster's website(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Jamster logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Jamster. 

Jamster's website(s) may also carry advertisements from other companies. Jamster is not responsible for the practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you have left the Jamster site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

Jamster's website(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Jamster (e.g., companies that are part of the News America Group). Although News America Group entities adhere to the Group’s [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy. 

**CHOICE** : JAMSTER WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII 

Jamster will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Jamster (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission. 

**USE** : JAMSTER'S USE OF PII 

Jamster will use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Jamster obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy. 

For example, Jamster may use your PII and Registration Data to send you important information and notices regarding your account and Jamster services. In addition, when Jamster collects PII from you itself in connection with your Download request, we will process your subscription or service request, including order fulfillment and payment processing if appropriate. In those instances, Jamster will not share your credit card information with third parties except those Jamster uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make and subscriptions you place through Jamster.com. 

Or, an affiliate of Jamster may provide you with Downloads by collecting PII on Jamster’s behalf when you register on Jamster.com or sign up for individual Downloads using your mobile phone. Jamster’s affiliate provides Jamster with the PII it needs to provide you with the Downloads and other services you requested. Jamster’s affiliate also provides your mobile communications provider with the information it needs to bill you for the Downloads and other services you purchased. 

Jamster may also use PII in aggregate, anonymous form for research purposes. 

Jamster may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us that are part of the News America Group ). Provided you have given us permission, Jamster may share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Jamster, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with unaffiliated third parties when PII is collected. 

Jamster employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Jamster may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide Jamster with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

Jamster may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Jamster to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on Jamster's website(s) . Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on Jamster's website(s).may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Jamster’s advertisers and business partners. 

There may be instances when Jamster may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Jamster, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our website(s); to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Jamster sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Jamster may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

**SECURITY** : JAMSTER PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII 

Jamster uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Jamster uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. 

**ACCESS, REMEDIES AND CONTACT** : HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII 

Whenever possible, visitors to Jamster may review the PII they have provided to us in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a visitor informs us is incorrect.
