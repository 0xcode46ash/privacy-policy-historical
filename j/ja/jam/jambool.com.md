Privacy Policy for Jambool Inc. (dba Social Gold)

(Last Updated: October 20, 2009)

This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect personally identifiable information in connection with our provision of the Social Gold payment service (“Information”) and how we disclose and protect that Information. Your use of the Social Gold payment service (“Service”) indicates your consent to the practices described in this Policy. 

We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you as may be required by law. We will also post the current version of the Policy on our website at www.jambool.com (“Site”) and update the “last updated” date set forth above. We encourage you to review our Policy periodically. Although we may provide this Policy to you through other means, your use of the Service reflects your agreement to receive the Policy through our Site or through links in web-based games, social websites or other social applications that accept payments through our Service.

This Policy applies to our current and former customers.

In this Policy, we refer to “non-affiliated third parties” and “Social Gold Merchants.” A “non-affiliated third party” is any company other than a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. A “Social Gold Merchant” is a company that operates, publishes or sells web-based games, social websites or other social applications and that accepts payments through our Service.

Information We Disclose to Non-affiliated Third Parties

We may disclose all the Information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. We do not otherwise disclose Information to non-affiliated third parties except as permitted by law.

Information that You Provide Both to Us and to a Social Gold Merchant

Please be aware that when you provide personal information such as your contact information, payment card information and transaction requests through some web-based games, social websites or other social applications, you will be providing that information to the Social Gold Merchant that operates, publishes or sells such games, websites or applications, in addition to us. If your information is provided concurrently to us and to a Social Gold Merchant, you will be notified prior to your provision of information to the Social Gold Merchant. This Policy does not apply to how such Social Gold Merchants may collect, use, disclose or protect such information, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the Social Gold Merchants. Please see the privacy policy of the applicable Social Gold Merchant to learn about its practices.

Information Security

We restrict access to Information about you to those employees who need to know that Information to provide products or services to you.
