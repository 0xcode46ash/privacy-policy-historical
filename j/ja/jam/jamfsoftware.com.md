# Privacy Policy | JAMF Software

JAMF Software, LLC (“JAMF”) makes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy was created to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices.  This Privacy Policy covers JAMF’s use of personal information that JAMF collects when you use certain of its corporate websites, including but not limited to:  [https://jamfnation.com](https://jamfnation.com/) and [http://jamfsoftware.com](http://jamfsoftware.com/) (collectively, the “Sites”). JAMF complies with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Switzerland Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  JAMF has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit:  <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.  JAMF periodically conducts objective reviews of its Privacy Policy and procedures to ensure continued compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE SITES. 

### 1\.  Types of Information Collected

**a.    _Personal Information Collected_** _._ There are areas on the Sites where you can share information that is unique to an individual; such as your name, company name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, zip code, and credit card information (“Personal Information”).  You can also purchase products and certification course packages with your credit card.  Accordingly, we may request your credit card information for shipping, billing, and credit card validation purposes.  We ask for this information in order to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product.  If you communicate with us by e-mail or complete online forms, we may require Personal Information that personally identifies you.  JAMF may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of having someone contact you for additional information, or in response to your request for information from us.  All of the foregoing is treated as Personal Information, as described in this policy.

**b.    _Information from Children_**.  JAMF does not knowingly solicit or collect information (including Data or Personal Information) from anyone under 13 years of age.  The use of the Sites by anyone under 13 years of age is prohibited.  We ask that anyone under 13 years of age not submit information to us.  However, when we e-mail information to you, we will provide prominently displayed instructions that show you how to unsubscribe from receiving such information.  If your child subscribes to receive information from JAMF without your knowledge, simply follow the instructions on our e-mail and unsubscribe immediately.  Parents can also contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete the Personal Information that has been submitted by a child.

**c.**     ** _Cookies_**.  JAMF may collect information about you and your use of the Sites whenever you visit the Sites. For instance, we may collect various forms of information such as entry and exit points for the Sites ( _i.e._ , referring URLs or domain names), site traffic statistics, operating system and browser type (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. In addition, when you request pages on the Sites, our servers automatically log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer or mobile device whenever you are surfing the Web. JAMF may store some information on your computer or mobile device in the form of a “cookie” or similar file to help us maintain and improve the Sites in many ways. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording such things as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  With most Internet browsers, you can erase “cookies” from your computer or mobile device hard drive, block all “cookies,” or receive a warning before a “cookie” is stored. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. Enabling cookies allows you to take full advantage of all the features on the Sites and we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you elect to block the cookies, we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience on the Sites.

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES, YOU CONSENT TO JAMF’S USE OF COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE HARD DRIVE.

**d.    _Do Not Track Signals_. **The Sites do not respond to Do Not Track signals.

JAMF may use the Personal Information on its own behalf for these purposes.  JAMF may use the Data in connection with the development, design, marketing or quality improvement of the Sites and for JAMF's general business purposes.  JAMF may collect, store, aggregate, analyze, and disclose data gleaned from Personal Information or other information that identifies you or any individual user.
