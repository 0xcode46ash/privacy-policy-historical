# Privacy Statement

**Privacy Statement for  
James S. Huggins' Refrigerator Door**

I created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate my firm commitment to privacy.   This page discloses my information gathering and dissemination practices for my website: James S. Huggins' Refrigerator Door. As you can see, it was not written by lawyers.

**Scenic Overlook**

I don't collect personal information on this site. I don't really care who you are.

I only keep the absolute minimum information required. For example, when you join my _[Snippets](https://web.archive.org/web/20000604222232id_/http%3A//www.jamesshuggins.com/h/bas1/snippets.htm)_ email list I keep your email address.

As another example, when you click around my site, my log files record how you clicked around. But I only use that information to analyze traffic and don't keep it or use it beyond that.

I keep any information you disclose absolutely private.

Spammers are the scum of the earth. I will never give away, sell or disclose your email address.

I only email you because you explicitly ask me to (e.g., to respond to a request or because you explicitly asked to join my _[Snippets](https://web.archive.org/web/20000604222232id_/http%3A//www.jamesshuggins.com/h/bas1/snippets.htm)_ email list.)

I am your friend.  I am a real friend, not a Linda Tripp friend. I promise not to tape our phone conversations.

I'm committed to privacy. I won't arbitrarily change these policies. I can't even envision changing these policies at all. But if someone ever offers me a wazillion dollars for the site on the condition that the policies change, they won't be "retroactive", all previously collected information will be purged, deleted and shredded and the change will be prominently disclosed. Your info is safe. Period. End of story.

I don't really care if you are married, or where you live, or how many goldfish you have.

I do care about your privacy.

**Use of Your TCP/IP Address**

I do not use TCP/IP address. It is collected in the log file of all site requests.
