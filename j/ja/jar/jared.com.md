As a result of our use of SSL technology, placing an order with jared.com online is just as safe as providing your credit card number over the telephone. In the unlikely event of credit card fraud, we will work with your credit card company to resolve the issue. Typically, credit card holders are not responsible for any fraudulent charges.
