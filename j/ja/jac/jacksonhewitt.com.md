## Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt 

## Voluntary Registration

We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website.  

## Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

## IP Addresses

Jackson Hewitt collects IP addresses for system administration, to report and review aggregate information, and to audit the use of the Website. When visitors request pages on our or our affiliates’ sites, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor will remain anonymous to us. We may use IP addresses to identify a visitor if it is necessary to protect our business and legal interests, Website, clients, or others. 

## Cookies

Cookies are used to specify a visitor’s preferences and to analyze a visitor’s Website usage trends and patterns. This helps us to better understand our visitors’ needs and improve areas of our services that our visitors may find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your internet browser preferences.  This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website and some services may not function properly or operate slower. 

We use Google’s services to display our advertisements on the internet.  Google utilizes cookies to display our advertisements based on your visit to the Website.  You may specifically opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting [www.google.com/privacy_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "Link To: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html") or [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "Link To: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp").

We do not save passwords or credit card information in cookies.   A cookie does not provide us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us as part of the voluntary registration process described above.
