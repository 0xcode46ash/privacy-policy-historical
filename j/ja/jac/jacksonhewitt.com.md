# Privacy Policy: Jackson Hewitt

Jackson Hewitt Inc. (“Jackson Hewitt,” “we,” “us” or “our”) recognizes the importance of protecting the information provided to us by visitors to [www.jacksonhewitt.com](http://www.jacksonhewitt.com/) (the “Website”). This privacy statement explains what information may be collected from you when you visit the Website, how that information is used and how it is shared with third parties. 

##### 

Jackson Hewitt offers individual tax preparation services and a wide range of financial products through various affiliates, franchisees and company-owed stores.  Because we offer in-store and online tax preparation services, our privacy policies will vary depending on how you interact with Jackson Hewitt.  This privacy policy applies solely to www.jacksonhewitt.com, independent of any business relationship you may have with us. ****

This privacy policy may change and will be updated on the Website. You should check this page periodically to ensure that you are in agreement with any changes.  If we amend this privacy policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such amendment by prominently posting notice of such amendment on the Website’s homepage.    ** __**

Information Collected by Jackson Hewitt

##### Voluntary Registration

We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Website or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Website. 

##### IP Addresses

Jackson Hewitt collects IP addresses for system administration, to report and review aggregate information, and to audit the use of the Website. When visitors request pages on our or our affiliates’ sites, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor will remain anonymous to us. We may use IP addresses to identify a visitor if it is necessary to protect our business and legal interests, Website, clients, or others.

##### Cookies

Cookies are used to specify a visitor’s preferences and to analyze a visitor’s Website usage trends and patterns. This helps us to better understand our visitors’ needs and improve areas of our services that our visitors may find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your internet browser preferences.  This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website and some services may not function properly or operate slower.

We do not save passwords or credit card information in cookies.   A cookie does not provide us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us as part of the voluntary registration process described above. 

##### How Jackson Hewitt May Use the Collected Information

Jackson Hewitt does not sell or market your personal information to any third parties. We use information collected on the Website for the following:

  * To provide the products and services you request and communicate with you regarding those requests
  * Internal market analysis
  * To improve our products and services
  * To provide you with information on new products or special offers 
  * To tailor the Website according to your interests
  * For marketing or promotional purposes 



Jackson Hewitt will not disclose to unaffiliated third parties any information collected in a manner that connects you with your personal information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we have a good faith belief that the law requires it. 

We also may use your information to inform you about other products or services available from Jackson Hewitt and our affiliates.  You may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from affiliated third parties. If you opt to receive information from these third parties, we will share your name and e-mail address with such third parties. We may match personal information collected on the Website with affiliated third party data. 

Jackson Hewitt may keep track of what portions of the Website visitors are viewing and other visitor statistics such as geographic location, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for future Website visits. This is all done without knowing your name or other personal information in order to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

##### How Your Personal Information May Be Shared with Third Parties

Jackson Hewitt may disclose the personal information you provide to us to our business partners, sponsors or affiliates so they can assist us in providing the services you request.  By requesting information from our business partners, sponsors, and affiliates through the Website, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to them so they can fulfill your request.

##### Third Party Websites 

The Website may contain links to other affiliated websites or websites of interest that are not under our direction or control.  These third party websites may include social networking websites and websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may contain our or our affiliates’ logo as part of a co-branding agreement.  These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit information.  Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you may provide while visiting such sites.  This privacy policy does not apply to those sites and only applies to [www.jacksonhewitt.com](http://www.jacksonhewitt.com/). You should exercise caution and review the privacy policy of those websites you are visiting.  

##### Other Uses

We may also disclose collected information in certain cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of our rights or property, visitors, or anyone else.  We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services. 

##### Security

The security of all information associated with our Website visitors is important to us. We exercise considerable care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers or those of our business partners. 

##### Phishing

“Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information.  If you receive an email that looks like it is from Jackson Hewitt asking you for your personal information, do not respond.  We will never request your personal information or credit card information through email.  

##### Controlling Your Personal Information 

You may choose to restrict Jackson Hewitt’s use of your personal information.   If you have provided your personal information to Jackson Hewitt and subsequently decide to restrict the use of this information or if you believe that any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please contact us at [JacksonHewittOnline@custhelp.com](mailto:JacksonHewittOnline@custhelp.com) or by calling 1-877-476-3353.
