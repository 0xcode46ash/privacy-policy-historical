This privacy statement explains what information may be collected from you when you visit our Websites, how that information is used and how it is shared with third parties.

**Jackson Hewitt offers individual tax preparation services and a wide range of financial products through various affiliates, franchisees and company-owned stores. Because we offer in-store and online tax preparation services, our privacy policies will vary depending on how you interact with Jackson Hewitt. This privacy policy applies solely to our Websites, independent of any business relationship you may have with us.**  

**This privacy policy may change and will be updated on our Websites. You should check this page periodically to ensure that you are in agreement with any changes. If we amend this privacy policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such amendment by prominently posting notice of such amendment on our Websites’ homepages.**

## Voluntary Registration

We collect personal information (which may include, without limitation, your name, email address, social security number, mailing address and/or telephone number) from you when you voluntarily register on the Websites or when you request information or a service (e.g., tax preparation services) on the Websites.

## Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our sites. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

## IP Addresses

Jackson Hewitt collects IP addresses for system administration, to report and review aggregate information, and to audit the use of our Websites. When visitors request pages on our or our affiliates’ sites, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor will remain anonymous to us. We may use IP addresses to identify a visitor if it is necessary to protect our business and legal interests, Website, clients, or others.

## Cookies

Cookies are used to specify a visitor’s preferences and to analyze a visitor’s Website usage trends and patterns. This helps us to better understand our visitors’ needs and improve areas of our services that our visitors may find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your internet browser preferences. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Websites and some services may not function properly or operate slower.

We use Google’s services to display our advertisements on the internet. Google utilizes cookies to display our advertisements based on your visit to the Websites. You may specifically opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting [www.google.com/privacy_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "Link To: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html") or [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "Link To: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp").

We do not save passwords or credit card information in cookies. A cookie does not provide us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us as part of the voluntary registration process described above.

## Web Beacons

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

We partner with FetchBack to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our Websites. FetchBack may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information such as IP Address, pages viewed, and if a conversion occurred during your visit to this website in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you. To learn more about this “behavioral advertising” practice or to opt-out of this use of your anonymous information, you can visit [www.FetchBack.com/optout.html](http://www.fetchback.com/optout.html).

## How Your Personal Information May Be Shared with Third Parties

Jackson Hewitt may disclose the personal information you provide to us to our business partners, sponsors or affiliates so they can assist us in providing the services you request. By requesting information from our business partners, sponsors, and affiliates through the Websites, you give us permission to transfer your personal information to them so they can fulfill your request.

## Blogs

If you use our blog on our Websites, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Third Party Websites

The Websites may contain links to other affiliated websites or websites of interest that are not under our direction or control. These third party websites may include social networking websites and websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may contain our or our affiliates’ logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit information. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you may provide while visiting such sites. This privacy policy does not apply to those sites and only applies to our Websites. You should exercise caution and review the privacy policy of those websites you are visiting.

We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

For registered users, we collect email address and account information to create a customer contact record to assist our Support Center in handling questions. Our hours of Chat operations are published within the chat feature. Outside of the chat hours of operation you have the option to email us your question. We ask for your email address so we can follow up on your question.

## Security

The security of all information associated with our Website visitors is important to us. We exercise considerable care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers or those of our business partners.

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number,) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <https://www.entrust.net/customer/profile.cfm?domain=www.jacksonhewitt.com>.

## Data Encryption

Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key." Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength.

## Web Server Authentication

An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.

## Phishing

“Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. you receive an email that looks like it is from Jackson Hewitt asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your personal information or credit card information through email.

## Controlling Your Personal Information
