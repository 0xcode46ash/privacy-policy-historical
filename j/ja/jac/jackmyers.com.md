[Telenovelas Continue to Heat Up Spanish-Language TV](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/the-charge-and-change-of-the-drama-brigade/)  
After all the decades U.S. Spanish-language TV networks have existed -- four, beginning with the launch of Univision in 1975, when it was known as Spanish International Network or SIN -- one genre unique to this medium continues to dominate primetime. Year after year, telenovelas running nightly over a four-to-six month span rack up the viewers, the ratings and the advertising revenue.

[The Shareability of OOH](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/The-Shareability-of-OOH/)

[Upfront News and Views: Nickelodeon Kicks It Off](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/upfront-news-and-views-nickelodeon-kicks-it-off/)  
The Upfront and NewFront season has begun! Over the next three months, television networks running over broadcast, basic cable and/or satellite, plus digital services available through smart TV sets and devices smartening up those sets (such as Roku, Chromecast, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Shield), will go public with their future programming strategies. The aim: Win a greater share of the advertising dollars transacted ahead of the 2016-17 TV season, which “begins” in mid-September, even in the age of year-round Peak TV. In what's become an annual MediaVillage tradition, we'll summarize and critique as many of these pubic showcases as possible, awarding coveted Jacks ratings for the overall events and in various categories from news value to the quality of presentations and presenters.
