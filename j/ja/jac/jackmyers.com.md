[Capturing Your Consumers in the First 5 Seconds](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/capturing-your-consumers-in-the-first-5-seconds-222/)  
This week, we are celebrating the endless creativity of the advertising and marketing worlds at Cannes International Festival of Creativity. We’re really excited to recognize and revisit this year’s slew of brilliant campaigns on Cannes’ international stage. There are so many great contenders -- the ads that moved people to tears, others that made them laugh and of course those that inspired them to take action.

[Video of the Week: Jon Stewart's Quiet Expression of Outrage](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/video-of-the-week-jon-stewarts-quiet-expression-of-outrage/)  
Jon Stewart on Thursday night opened his Comedy Central program “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” in serious commentator mode, talking about the mass murder the night before at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.

[Stuart Elliott: Rainbows Over Madison Avenue May Lead to Pots of Gold](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/stuart-elliott-rainbows-over-madison-avenue-may-lead-to-pots-of-gold/)  
In their never-ending efforts to sell, sell, sell, advertisers long have found inspiration in the calendar, borrowing interest from holidays such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, the Fourth of July, Halloween and, of course, Christmas. In recent years, reflecting the increasing diversity of the consumers they seek to reach, advertisers have added Dr. King's Birthday and Cinco de Mayo.

[Elon Musk: The Edison/Tesla/Ford of the Digital Age](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/elon-musk-the-edisonteslaford-of-the-digital-age/)  
I have been an admirer, yes, even a fan of Elon Musk ever since I first learned about Tesla Motors ten years ago. I state that because now it seems that Elon Musk is everywhere in the media -- online, magazines, a best-selling biography (which I have purchased but have yet to start) -- simply because he is out to change the world and people are finally taking notice.

[Remembering Ralph Roberts](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/remembering-ralph-roberts/)  
Ralph Roberts was one of the good guys. Along with Bill Daniels, Bill Brazeal, J. C. Sparkman, Irving Kahn and Bill Bresnan he was always ready to lend a guiding hand to those of us who were (in the late 1960s, some years after Ralph bought his first system in Tupelo Mississippi) new to the industry. I remember Ralph with special fondness as he accepted my early long-haired, hippie journalist persona, inviting me (off the record) to join his annual dinner with his top guys, including the late Dan Aaron (who had been the selling negotiator in Tupelo) and the great Julian Brodsky, his financiers and, after a couple dinners, Brian, too. I was privileged to learn a lot that way.

[Rehabilitating a Fragile Direct Response TV Ecosystem](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/rehabilitating-a-fragile-direct-response-tv-ecosystem/)  
“Whenever possible, one should focus on removing fragilizing interdependencies rather than imposing additional structure and activity that will only increase the fragility of the system as a whole.” -- Nassim Taleb, Rupert Read and Yaneer Bar-yam; from the paper, Precautionary Principle*

[“TREotM”: The Sixties](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/treotm-the-sixties/)  
Chapter 10, Part 4

[The Missing Media Metric: Reach Velocity — Part 2](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/the-missing-media-metric-reach-velocity-part-2/)  
In our last post, we discussed what makes Reach Velocity important: It is the best media metric to use in order to maximize the double-tap effect. The faster reach grows, the higher reach will be in any two-day period under the reach curve. And the higher the reach in a two-day period, the higher the reach-at-2-frequency will be in a two-day period.

[Agencies in Turmoil: Contracts, Rebates and “Dark Pools”](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/agencies-in-turmoil-contracts-and-enquiries-rebates-and-dark-pools/)  
And so the play continues towards the endgame. With some unimaginably large percentage of US/global media spending up for review the last week brought new revelations around what is fast moving from being an arcane discussion into something close to front page news.

[Data, Data Everywhere in the Upfront: An Overview -- Part 4](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/data-data-everywhere-in-the-upfront-an-overview-part-4/)  
This is the fourth part of a five-part series examining the new data initiatives of major data companies. Parts 1 through 3 outlined the many data initiatives, their scalability and whether their services were gaining traction in the industry.

[The Context of Contextual Content](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/the-context-of-contextual-content/)  
Content is king. We’ve all heard that over and over, right? But it’s getting to the point that content isn’t just king; it’s a benevolent dictator. There’s so much content out there now that it sometimes seems as if we serve the content rather than the content serving us.

[Outsourcing Control](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/outsourcing-control/)  
Your smartphone may be distracting – but it can also simplify your life. This week, on Mindshare’s Culture Vulture Live (below), Jeff Malmad explores one of this year’s growing consumer trends: Outsourcing control to technology.

[NetNeut for Real (Sort of)! Will Ad Blockers Stop Mobile Ad Growth?](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/netneut-for-real-sort-of-will-ad-blockers-stop-mobile-ad-growth/)  
Well, we’re now being regulated under Title II (otherwise known as the Communications Bar Employment project). I think. But neither I, nor the Federal Confusion Commission actually knows what the rules are or will be. That really shouldn’t surprise anyone. The failed requests for a stay of the rules clearly made the case the FCC isn’t ready for prime time.

[Is the New Apple Music a Mess?](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/is-the-new-apple-music-a-mess/)  
And … the new marketing muscle of your favorite movie stars.

[Don’t Launch a Media Agency Review Right Now](https://www.mediavillage.com/article/dont-launch-a-media-agency-review-right-now/)  
At the moment there are 16 media agency reviews being conducted (that we know of). That’s tens of billions of dollars in play. There is probably someone else out there that has not yet announced.
