Jackrabbit is committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us. We want you to understand the care with which we treat your personal information.

[**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130602030117id_/http%3A//www.jackrabbitclass.com/faqs.asp)

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

### Information

Jackrabbit will not disclose your private and confidential information to any outside organization. Information regarding your organization (such as organization name, address and phone number) will not be given or sold to any outside organization. 

### Security

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. While we strive to protect your confidential information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

### Data Encryption

Jackrabbit is committed to data security with respect to information collected and maintained on our site(s). To help protect your confidential information, we support the ability to encrypt all data. Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble your confidential information in transit to and from Jackrabbit. 

The Jackrabbit site utilizes an industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of confidential information. Use of our site requires the use of either Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 (or higher) or Netscape Navigator 4.0 (or higher). These browsers are security-enabled so you can choose whether or not the information you transmit to us is encrypted, making it extremely difficult to read even if it is wrongly intercepted. 

### Commitment

Personal data privacy is a policy we are committed to and Jackrabbit is constantly addressing new demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [**info@JackrabbitTech.com**](mailto:info@JackrabbitTech.com)

We are very excited about Jackrabbit's Timeclock feature! It is user friendly, easy to access and very little time is required to get it set up and get your employees on board. The management features such as the ability to approve time, close pay periods, and quickly locate not approved time from prior pay periods help streamline our payroll process and reduce errors. The Timeclock module is very flexible and can be configured to fit many different payroll environments. Most importantly, as usual, the Jackrabbit staff has been extremely helpful, professional and responsive to our issues as we worked to implement this feature.

Before Jackrabbit, I was not using any type of software system. It was so easy to learn the program through your online manual, video help, and customer support. I am really impressed with the amount of enhancements that are made to the software. You are always improving and adding new helpful ways to make your program even better. The biggest help has been online registration! This has saved us hours of paperwork. As a studio we look much more organized, professional, and definitely stand out from other local competitors. Thank you for all that you do!
