# Online Class/Gym Management Software - Privacy & Security Information

Jackrabbit is committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us. We want you to understand the care with which we treat your personal information.

[**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://web.archive.org/web/20120509133507id_/http%3A//www.jackrabbitclass.com/faqs.asp)

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

### Information

Jackrabbit will not disclose your private and confidential information to any outside organization. Information regarding your organization (such as organization name, address and phone number) will not be given or sold to any outside organization. 

### Security

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. While we strive to protect your confidential information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

### Data Encryption

Jackrabbit is committed to data security with respect to information collected and maintained on our site(s). To help protect your confidential information, we support the ability to encrypt all data. Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble your confidential information in transit to and from Jackrabbit. 

The Jackrabbit site utilizes an industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of confidential information. Use of our site requires the use of either Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 (or higher) or Netscape Navigator 4.0 (or higher). These browsers are security-enabled so you can choose whether or not the information you transmit to us is encrypted, making it extremely difficult to read even if it is wrongly intercepted. 

### Commitment

Personal data privacy is a policy we are committed to and Jackrabbit is constantly addressing new demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [**info@JackrabbitTech.com**](mailto:info@JackrabbitTech.com)

Kids First runs over 3000 kids through summer camps. Well, I became reacquainted with Mark Mahoney and his Jackrabbit biz software. At the time, I was mildly reticent about the fact it was web-based, yet in August, Kids First decided to make the 'big switch' due largely to Mark's integrity and my 'gut feel' that Jackrabbit was going to the 'program of the future.' During the data transfer, things went seamlessly despite our large enrollment.

What about the day-to-day 'usability' of Jackrabbit? For 9 months the Jackrabbit Support Team has worked closely with the Kids First crew to make the enhancements necessary to handle a club of 5100 enrollment. At the May BOOT CAMP, when asked how she liked Jackrabbit, Mary, Kids First's Customer Service Department Leader responded by saying 'I am ecstatic. It is fast and so easy to learn for my crew.' Those were the words I was waiting to hear and the reason I decided it was time to write this testimonial.

Do you want a speedy, stable, safe, easy to learn and use, future-oriented program owned, written and supported by a team of people with impeccable integrity? Then may I strongly suggest Jackrabbit.

Jackrabbit has done a great job with the online registration feature. We have linked in the Jackrabbit software to our website, so now our clients can register themselves online day or night. Busy moms today really love this feature, and I can tell you that moms often register their kids late at night after all the kids are tucked away for the evening. This has helped us bring a new level of convenience and service to our clients as now they can register from anywhere at any time. Online registration saves both us and our customers time and money, and frees our staff up to do even more amazing things for our clients and our business.
