Before Jackrabbit, I was not using any type of software system. It was so easy to learn the program through your online manual, video help, and customer support. I am really impressed with the amount of enhancements that are made to the software. You are always improving and adding new helpful ways to make your program even better. The biggest help has been online registration! This has saved us hours of paperwork. As a studio we look much more organized, professional, and definitely stand out from other local competitors. Thank you for all that you do!

Kids First runs over 3000 kids through summer camps. Well, I became reacquainted with Mark Mahoney and his Jackrabbit biz software. At the time, I was mildly reticent about the fact it was web-based, yet in August, Kids First decided to make the 'big switch' due largely to Mark's integrity and my 'gut feel' that Jackrabbit was going to the 'program of the future.' During the data transfer, things went seamlessly despite our large enrollment.

What about the day-to-day 'usability' of Jackrabbit? For 9 months the Jackrabbit Support Team has worked closely with the Kids First crew to make the enhancements necessary to handle a club of 5100 enrollment. At the May BOOT CAMP, when asked how she liked Jackrabbit, Mary, Kids First's Customer Service Department Leader responded by saying 'I am ecstatic. It is fast and so easy to learn for my crew.' Those were the words I was waiting to hear and the reason I decided it was time to write this testimonial.

Do you want a speedy, stable, safe, easy to learn and use, future-oriented program owned, written and supported by a team of people with impeccable integrity? Then may I strongly suggest Jackrabbit.
