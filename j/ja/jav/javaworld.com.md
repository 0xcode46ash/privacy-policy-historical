**Ad Serving Technology**

ITworld.com has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on [http://www.itworld.com](http://www.itworld.com/) both on the Web site and through our e-mail newsletters. When DoubleClick serves ads to the user, it uses cookies to track certain types of non-personally identifiable information such as a user's IP address, their browser version or type, operating system, service provider and their local time. In addition, ITworld.com uses clear gifs, or pixel tags provided by DoubleClick to allow the browser's cookie to be recognized when the browser visits the ITworld.com site. 

Information collected and shared through this technology is not personally identifiable (i.e. It does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address). DoubleClick does share non-personally identifiable information such as user profiles based on click-stream profile data with ITworld.com but strictly in aggregate form. Moreover, any page a user calls up on ITworld.com will not be connected with personally-identifiable information collected either at ITworld.com or elsewhere.

**What information does ITworld.com collect and how is it used?**

ITworld.com collects optional data supplied by visitors to our web site through registration, surveys, sweepstakes or contests, as well as information that we gather from visitors via our server log. This information enables us to better tailor our content to your interests, and to help our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. Our site is completely free, and is supported by paid advertisements and it is therefore critically important for us to be able to identify our audience. Information is only shared with advertisers or any other third parties in aggregate form. We are also firmly committed to identifying whether information presented on our sites is written by our editorial staff or is contributed by a user or vendor. 

**IP Addresses**

For each visitor to our site, our web server automatically records the visitor's domain and IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

**What are cookies and how does ITworld.com use them?**

Cookies are small files that contain information a web site uses for tracking a visit. Our site uses cookies to authenticate who you are and what information you have registered for access to. We also use this to keep track of your service selections and to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You password is encrypted within the cookie, so this cannot be accessed by any outside parties. As an option, a visitor may choose to reject a cookie and instead use their personal identifier each time they visit and select services that require authentication. Not all areas of our sites require authentication.   
We use an outside serving company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**How is our registration data used?**

Some optional services that ITworld.com offers require registration. Our site's registration process requests that users give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers for authentication, and demographic information that pertains to their professions such as business industry and job function. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only to those who opt to receive it. These messages are delivered by us, and we never allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests. We also use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Unique identifiers such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our database. This site contains links to other sites and ITworld.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**How is vendor webcast registration data used?**

ITworld.com acts as a service provider to produce vendor webcasts for various clients and vendors. Any data that is collected during such events belongs solely to that client. The specific data that is collected is determined by that client, and varies from program to program. Data that is collected may be used for follow up purposes. 

**Surveys**

We occasionally run surveys that are optional to participate in. We only ask participants for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information that pertains to their profession or professional interests. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, or for the delivery of prizes or rewards. Users may opt-out of receiving future survey mailings; please see the choice/opt-out section below. The survey data is only used in aggregate form and may be used to guide our editorial process or site development process. 

**Partner Sites**

ITworld.com has several partners that produce ITworld.com co-branded services for us. Information that is shared with or collected at partner sites is used to provide the services that the user selects at that site. Communication by our partners with ITworld.com customers is limited to the services that our customers select. For example, if a customer requests to be notified when information on a selected topic becomes available, the partner site may contact our customers. Customers are given the option to discontinue services at any time. Additionally a user name and password may be shared with partner sites for the purpose of logging a customer in to an ITworld.com service hosted in another domain. If desired, customers may choose to exclude the sharing of this information during the registration process, or by modifying their profile and service selections. Our partner sites currently include:
