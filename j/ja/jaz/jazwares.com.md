**_NOTE TO PARENTS_**

JAZWARES has developed its website to be an enjoyable experience for everyone. JAZWARES realizes that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the website or how this site operates, which is the purpose of this Privacy Policy. Please discuss this policy with your children so that they will better understand JAZWARES website and the information they may be asked to provide. JAZWARES strongly believes that the best way to help protect your privacy on this site is to provide you with adequate and accurate information about the website and the information that is collected. 

**Children Under 13: Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information**

Children under the age of 13 should never provide personal information on the Internet without first discussing the site with their parents. To comply with COPPA, JAZWARES asks all users who wish to provide information to JAZWARES for their birthdate. If a user indicates that they are under 13 years of age, parental consent is needed before they can provide JAZWARES with personally identifiable information. JAZWARES may collect and store personal information about children under 13 (“children” or “child”) if it is submitted in connection with the parent’s verifiable consent. JAZWARES will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted, and we will not use cookies to obtain personally identifiable information of children. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on “Cookies” (above).

If given verifiable permission from a parent, JAZWARES may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, mailing address, parent’s or guardian’s name, and parent’s or guardian’s email address. JAZWARES may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child’s date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child’s personal information.

We will only collect the amount of personal information from children that is reasonably necessary to participate in the website activities. We also are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity, like contests, on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Once collected, a child’s registration information may be used to: (a) allow participation in activities on our site (e.g., contests) and (b) allow us to communicate with the child regarding promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide to our visitors and better meet their needs.

•  JAZWARES might collect information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent in the following special situations as outlined in COPPA:

•  JAZWARES may collect an email address to respond to a one time request from a child. After responding to the request, JAZWARES will delete the email address.

•  JAZWARES may collect email addresses of parents or children in order to provide notice and seek consent for the child’s submission of information.

•  JAZWARES may collect an email address for an ongoing request by a child, for example a subscription to a newsletter, but JAZWARES will provide notice to parents about the ongoing communication and will provide parents with the opportunity to stop the communication before delivering the second communication.

•   JAZWARES may collect information necessary to protect the safety of the child who is participating on the site. JAZWARES will notify parents of this collection and allow them the opportunity to prevent further use of the information.

•  JAZWARES may collect information as required by law enforcement or to protect the security of the site, but will not use the information for any further purpose.
