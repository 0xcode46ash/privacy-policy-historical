Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of Janrain.com if you do so.

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We may use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to help serve offers that may be of interest to users. Please keep in mind that no personally identifiable information concerning users is conveyed to any advertiser when ads are served based on keywords.

We may determine categories of interests expressed by our users that we aggregate on a non-personally identifiable level. This aggregated "category of interest" information will enable us to improve our functionality, features, and offers of interest to our users.
