Privacy and Security

If you are having problems with our site or have questions, this is your first stop for help and general information. Please look through the following topics, to see if we have already answered your question. If not please feel free to email us with your situation. 

**Privacy Policy**

We at J&R take your privacy as seriously as you do. To help ensure your privacy, we use the most up-to-date encryption technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible. This includes your billing, credit card, and account information; none of this can be read as it travels to our system. 

We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information, such as name, email address, physical address, phone numbers, buying history, etc. without your permission. **Your information stays here, period**. You do not have to worry about receiving unsolicited email from other companies or individuals as a result of shopping, entering a contest or an auction at JR.com. If you would like to receive email regarding J&R Specials, check the appropriate box during the Order process, Registration process, or click the link for the J&R Newsletter on our Home Page and fill in the form. Every email newsletter comes with a link to unsubscribe. We do, on occasion, send out an email announcement to inform our customers when we add a major new feature to our website; once again, those email addresses are not shared with anyone else. 

If you wish us to retain personal information (to make repeat shopping easier), you need to complete our registration process, which includes setting up a unique Username and Password. To modify your personal information, you will need to click on " **My Account** ", and enter your user name and password. 

If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please contact [custserv@jr.com](mailto:custserv@jr.com)

 **Cookies**

We require the Secure Sockets Layer ( **SSL** ) protocol and Session Cookies to be enabled on your browser in order to take advantage of many special features, such as registration and ordering, or you will not be able to place an order online. Session cookies allow us to hold items in your unique shopping cart, and to tell your shopping cart from that of another user. 

In order to assure that these services work, you may need to set-up your web browser. Here are some simple instructions; 

If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can check and change the status of your SSL setting by clicking on Tools at the top of the browser, select Internet Options, click on the Advanced tab, scroll down to Security and make sure SSL is checked. You can check and change the cookies setting by clicking on Tools at the top of the browser, select Internet Options, click on the Security tab and then Custom Level, scroll down to Cookies and make sure it is enabled. 

If you use Netscape, you can check and change the status of your SSL setting by clicking on Security at the top of the browser, select Navigator on the left column, and make sure SSL 2.0 is checked under Advanced Security (SSL) Configuration. You can check and change the cookies setting by clicking on Edit at the top of the browser, select Preferences, click Advanced and make sure "Accept all cookies" is set.

 **Secure Shopping**

At jr.com your order process is secured with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. SSL provides you with the freedom to shop online without the fear of your credit card information being stolen. This encryption compares to a combination lock that has several trillions of combinations. There are three ways that indicate whether you're on a secure web page: 

  1. All URL's (web addresses) that require and use an SSL connection start with **https:** instead of **http:**
  2. The key or padlock on your browser screen will become solid. 
  3. Security Alert messages may popup while moving between regular and secure pages. 



VeriSign is a service that authenticates the integrity of this encryption method (see the VeriSign logo on the screen during the order process).
