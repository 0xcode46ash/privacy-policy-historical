### 2\. Consent

By providing personal information to our websites, you consent to its use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and, if you live outside the U.S., you consent to the transfer of such information to the U.S. In particular, we post testimonials on Janrain’s websites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Salesforce.com obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@janrain.com](mailto:privacy@janrain.com).

### 3\. Personal Information We Collect

  * **Information You Give Us**



We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This information may include (a) your name, email address, and other personal information; (b) your interaction with website features; (c) transaction-related information, such as, when you download software from us; and (d) information you provide us when you contact us for assistance.

  * **Information We Collect Automatically and Cookies**



Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Janrain and our marketing partners or analytics service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to analyze website visitor interest in website content and offer relevant information based on their viewing history _._ Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store user identifiers to enable single sign on for our registered website users. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information.

  * **Behavioral Targeting**



We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

  * **Do-Not-Track**



There are different ways you can prevent your online activity being tracked. One of those is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that our websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally-accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.

For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit allaboutcookies.org and allaboutdnt.com.

### 8\. Customer Data

**Observance of Safe Harbor Principles**

As mentioned at the beginning of this Privacy Statement, we offer our customers a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) customer profile management platform and abide by the U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States. As a processor of personal information on behalf of our customers, we observe the Safe Harbor Principles, several of which are discussed below.

Janrain collects information under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.

Notice and Choice: Individuals may submit personal information to our customers through the use of the website registration and login services we provide to our customers. (Some of these services may have a notice that they are “powered by Janrain”). This personal information is submitted with notice to, and the consent of, the individual user via identity providers’ permission screens, or voluntarily provided by the user at registration. Once Janrain has successfully facilitated the transmission of personal information to a customer’s database that is not hosted by Janrain, it is that customer’s responsibility to guard any the personal information against unauthorized access or transmission.

Our Role Processing and Protecting Customer Data: As part of our Janrain Customer Identity Management Platform™, we may receive and host on our customers’ behalf such personal information and other data a customer may provide to us for hosting (collectively, “Customer Data”). Our customers are the data controllers of Customer Data. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. We do not determine how our customers use Customer Data, and we will not access or disclose it except as directed by our customers or required by law.

Accessing, Correcting, Amending, or Deleting Personal Information: If you are an individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete your personal information which Janrain may be storing on behalf of our customer, you should direct your request to the applicable Janrain customer acting as the data controller for such information. Customers may access and delete Customer Data, including an individual record, via an application provider interface or API. If requested to remove/access data we will respond within 30 days. Following the deletion of personal information in a database we host, the related backup data will be deleted, generally within 30 days. Janrain will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
