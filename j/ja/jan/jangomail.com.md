### Your Email Lists and Databases

While using this service, you provide third party email addresses which are owned by you. This data may be imported using an import contacts or database upload feature. JangoMail and its parent company will never sell, rent, share, or otherwise make available your email lists and/or databases to anyone except internal support personnel who may be assisting you in troubleshooting your account, unless it is required to do so in connection with legal process or in accordance with any law, regulation or order of a court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction. JangoMail is not in the business of selling data. JangoMail is in the business of providing a web-based mass email service. 

  


### Website Usage Information

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. We do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. JangoMail does not track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain a superior and informative website for you. 

  


### The Information We Collect

Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, address, and facts about your company size, and similar information. We collect this information so we can fulfill your order, create and administer your account and respond to your customer service requests. We do not request sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers, unless they are signing up for and paying for our services. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies. 

  


### Access

If you want access to your information to make changes or corrections, please login to your account and update it under “My Account.” If you would like your information deleted, please contact us as described below and we will respond within 30 days. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may be required to retain some data to meet legal retention requirements. If this is the case, we will let you know in our response to your inquiry. 

  


### Newsletters

JangoMail sends newsletters and other communications to those who subscribe on our site for the newsletter, free trial, or paid membership. We will use your name and email address to send these communications to you. Newsletters and other JangoMail communications may include tracking technologies that allow us to see when messages have been opened, links clicked, and pages on our own website visited as a response to the emailing. 

  


### Agents

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

We may also provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

  


### Security Technology

JangoMail has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside JangoMail. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. 

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <http://www.thawte.com/resources/ssl-information-center/get-started-with-ssl/index.html>. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

  


### Widgets

Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information, given the user’s choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings, and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Forms which require sensitive information such as financial information (credit card) to process purchases for products or services are SSL encrypted to protect your sensitive information. 

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it. 

  


### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
