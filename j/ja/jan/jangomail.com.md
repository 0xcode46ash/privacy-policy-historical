JangoMail Privacy Statement  **PRIVACY STATEMENT**

JangoMail has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with the JangoMail public web site and the JangoMail application (for clients). We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

**Your E-mail Lists and Databases**  
JangoMail and its parent company will never sell, rent, share, or otherwise make available your e-mail lists and/or databases to anyone except internal support personnel who may be assisting you in troubleshooting your account. JangoMail is not in the business of selling data. JangoMail is in the business of providing a web-based mass e-mail service.

**Website Usage Information**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. JangoMail does not track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain a superior and informative website for you.

**The Information We Collect  
**Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, address, and facts about your company size, and similar information. We do not request sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers, unless they are signing up for and paying for our services. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies.

**Security Technology**  
JangoMail has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside JangoMail. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.

**Acquisition or Changes in Ownership of JangoMail  
**In the event that JangoMail (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, customer information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.

**Policy Modifications  
**We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when JangoMail makes changes to this privacy statement, we will highlight the changes on our homepage and email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
