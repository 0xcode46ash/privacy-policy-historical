We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may engage third parties to perform functions on our behalf consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may provide your personal information to those third parties in order to allow them to perform their functions for us. Such information will be transmitted only through reasonably secure channels.

Any sweepstake, contest or similar promotion made available through our website may be governed by rules specific to that contest, sweepstake or other promotion.
