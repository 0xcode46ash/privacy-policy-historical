The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by us, such as Fanatics ([shop.jaguars.com](http://shop.jaguars.com/ "Jaguars Pro Shop")) and the Jaguars Social League ([ **www.jaguarssocialleague.com/**](http://www.jaguarssocialleague.com/)), and certain of our media partners and sponsors.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.

**6\. Security**

We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us.  For example, if we collect financial information, we will use encryption software to help protect this information when it is in transit. Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

**7\. Children’s Privacy**

The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) on our dedicated kid site www.jaguarskidsclub.com.   If we are made aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 years old in a manner that is inconsistent with COPPA on [**www.jaguars.com**](http://www.jaguars.com/) or [**www.jaguarswomensclub.com**](http://www.jaguarswomensclub.com/), we will delete this information as soon as possible.

**8\. Changes To This Privacy Policy**

******10\. Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

**11\. International Users**

Please note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.

**Jacksonville Jaguars Kids (Under 13) Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: September 8, 2014

This Kids Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from users of our Website, [www.jaguarskidsclub.com](http://www.jaguarskidsclub.com/ "Jaguars Kids Club") (our "Kid Site"). When we use the word "kid" or "child" in this Policy, we mean a user under the age of 13. When we use the word "parent" in this Policy, we mean a kid's parent or legal guardian. Our Kid Site is owned by Jacksonville Jaguars, LLC, One EverBank Field Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32202, Email: [kidsclub@jaguars.com](mailto:%20kidsclub@jaguars.com), Phone: (904) 633-2000 (referred to in this Kids Privacy Policy as "we," "us," "our" or other similar pronouns) and operated by Match Up Promotions, LLC.

**1\. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM KID USERS THROUGH THE KID SITES?**

**Direct Collection**

In the course of using the Site, you may provide us with certain information, including Personal Information.  The "Personal Information" that we may collect on the Kids Site includes child’s first and last name, home address, age, telephone number, parent’s e-mail address, or other online contact information. Other information that we may collect includes gender, age, first name, that, in and of itself, is not personally identifiable. Please note that all information collected on the Kid Site is collected directly from the parent.

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Kid Site, including but not limited to those described below:

**_E-mail_** : In the case where a user submits an email to kidsclub@jaguars.com, we will respond to this one-time email and subsequently delete any Personal Information that is associated with a child. In the case where a user submits a coloring page to kidsclub@jaguars.com, if that coloring page contains any Personal Information that is associated with a child, we will not post it on the Kid Site and the file will be deleted.

**_Registration for the Jaguars Kids Club_** : The Kid Site allows users to join the Jaguars “Kids Club.” The registration process requires parent users to submit their email address, username and birthdate, however we do not allow users under the age of 18 to complete the registration process. The child's parent will need to complete the registration process, the purchase form and pay for the membership using their credit card.

In the event that we collect Personal Information from a child, we will ask the child's parent for consent before we collect it, except as permitted by law, such as where we are only using an email address to respond directly to a request from the child. If the email is collected for a one-time response, we delete it after the response is sent. If the email is collected to respond more than once to the child, we will also ask for the parent's email, so we can let the parent know that the child has given us Personal Information and give the parent a chance to tell us to delete that Personal Information before we re-contact the child. In that case, we will delete the child's email either at the parent's request, or, if no such request is made, when we have finished responding to the child and otherwise fulfilled the purpose for which the email was collected.

We may request the parent's consent in any way the law allows. For example, if the child's Personal Information will be used only by us, we may ask for the parent's consent by email. If the child's Personal Information will be disclosed on the Kid Site or shared with a third party, we may verify that the person providing consent is the parent by asking for consent in connection with a credit card transaction. Parents have the option to consent to the collection and use of their children's information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties, except to the extent that disclosure of such information is a necessary part of the activity for which parental consent is given. Notice of the information collection, use and disclosure practices associated with a particular online activity will be provided to the parent when we ask for consent. That notice will also be on the Kid Site to which it applies. Sometimes, in connection with the direct notice to the parent, we may collect the parent or child's name from the child (for example, the child's first name, so that the parent knows which of their children wants to sign up for an activity).

There are many activities on our Kid Site that kids can participate in without having to share any Personal Information. Examples include our news, games and coloring web pages.

**Passive Collection**

When a child visits a Kid Site, our systems automatically collect the Internet protocol, or "IP", address associated with the child's computer. An IP address is a string of numbers that is usually controlled by a user's Internet service provider, and automatically assigned when a user's computer connects to the Internet. We use this information to identify and fix problems with the way our Kid Sites work. IP addresses can also give us general location information from our child users, such as continent or region within the United States.

  
We also collect "clickstream data." Clickstream data is information about a user's "clicks" or actions on a Kid Site, such as the pages, content seen or clicked on, downloads, games played, and other activity. Clickstream data also includes information about a child's computer or device, Web browser and operating system and settings and may include referrer URL information that is automatically passed to us (that is, information about where the user came from before arriving on our on our Kid Site, which may include terms in the URL string).

  
Here are examples of the technical tools we use to collect usage information about children's visits to our Kid Sites:

  * Cookies: Cookies are small data files sent by a Web site or application and saved on a user's computer or device at the request of that site or app. A browser cookie stores information about the user's Web browser, so we can recognize that browser when a user comes back to that site or app. Most browsers can be set to detect or reject browser cookies, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, make it difficult or impossible to use a Kid Site. More information about the use of browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, is available in the tools, help or similar section of Web browsers and at allaboutcookies.org.  **By allowing their children to use our Kid Sites, parents agree to the placement of cookies on their child's computer or device.**
  * Local shared object: Local shared objects, such as "Flash cookies," may be stored on a computer or device through a media player or other software installed on that computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Flash cookies are often used in activities like games, to store scores or other progress. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on a computer or device, they can be managed using software settings. Information about managing Flash cookies is available athttp://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. As with browser cookies, some features of our Kid Site will not work as well if Flash cookies are turned off.  **By allowing their children to use our Kid Sites, parents agree to the placement of local shared objects on their child's computer or device.**
  * Pixel tags: A pixel tag (also known as a "clear GIF" or "web beacon") is a tiny image that can be placed on a Web page or in emails to users, to tell us when a user has displayed that page or opened those emails.



We use these tools to learn how we can make our Kid Sites better. For example, by counting the number of users who visit our Sites, particular pages or activities.

These tools may allow us to assign a unique number to our child users, but this number is not be used to track child users across different, unaffiliated Web sites. We also do not link a child's user number or Kid Site usage information with the child's Personal Information, or collect geolocation information more specific than city or zip code, unless we get consent from the child's parent. We do not track kids across different, unaffiliated sites, online services or applications using any other persistent identifiers unless we have a parent's consent. We do not use IP addresses or the child's unique number to attempt to identify individual kid users except under the circumstances described in the "Legal Disclosures" paragraph of this Kids PrivacyPolicy.

  
**2** **. HOW IS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT KID USERS USED AND SHARED?**

Parents have a right to consent to our collection and use of their child’s information without also having to consent to the sharing of such information, as Parent’s have a choice as to who we may share their child’s information with.

**Use of Information**

Any Personal Information we collect from or about a child via our Kid Site is used to provide services and features, process and respond to the child's requests, provide customer service, and to contact the child or the child's parent about the child's use of the Kid Site. We do not use any Personal Information we collect from or about a child via our Kid Site for marketing purposes.

  
**Community Features**

The Kids Site does not make kids’ Personal Information publicly available. Kids can submit coloring pages to be posted on the Kid Site, but these submissions are moderated before they are made public. As noted above, if any submitted coloring page contains any Personal Information that is associated with a child, we will not post it on the Kid Site and the file will be deleted.

  
**Disclosure to Service Providers**

The Personal Information and site usage information we collect on Kid Sites may be collected or accessed by our service providers (whether third parties or our corporate affiliates) who support and administer the internal operations of our Kid Sites (including our website analytics provider), such as to enable registration and maintenance of accounts, to fulfill account requests, and to provide customer service. Service providers also assist us in collecting and understanding Kid Site usage information. We may share non-personally identifiable Kid Site usage information (including aggregate data) with others, for their own use.

**Legal Disclosures**

We reserve the right to release a child's Personal Information, or to use a child's IP address or unique number to attempt to identify a child user, to the extent consistent with applicable law, when we believe release is required to comply with federal, state or local law (such as cooperating with a judicial process or law enforcement investigation), to maintain the safety and integrity of the Kid Site, to enforce any applicable terms of use, or to protect the child or our or others' rights, property or safety, or to take precautions against any other liability.

**Business Transfers**

In connection with a corporate change or dissolution, including for example a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets, wind-down of business or related due diligence, children's Personal Information and children's site usage information may be among the transferred assets or disclosed to third parties. To the extent required by law, we will get parental consent before sharing children's Personal Information under such circumstances, and will obtain the agreement of the third party to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of that Personal Information.

  
**Other Disclosures**

Unless we have obtained a child's parent's consent as required by applicable law, a child's Personal Information is not shared with third parties (even with corporate affiliates, unless they are co-operators of the Kid Site where the Personal Information was collected) for their own use or disclosure except as described under the "Legal Disclosures" and "Business Transfers" paragraphs of this Kids Privacy Policy. 

**3\. SECURITY**  
While we have policies and procedures in place and take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of Personal Information collected on our Kid Sites, we cannot guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from intrusion during transmission, while stored on our systems, or when otherwise in our care. Except as expressly required by applicable statute or regulation, we will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

  
If we believe that the security of Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify users of that development, as soon as possible under the circumstances. If we have a parent or teacher email address associated with a child user whose Personal Information may have been compromised, we may send the notice by email. **Users who prefer to get such a notice by U.S. mail should email us at kidsclub@jaguars.com.**

  
**4\. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW YOUR CHILD’S PERSONAL INFORMATION OR DELETE YOUR CHILD’S PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

If you are a parent of one of our child users, you can

  * review your child's Personal Information
  * revoke any consent you have given for your child
  * ask us to delete Personal Information your child has given us
  * ask that we no longer collect or use Personal Information from your child



At your request, we will stop collecting, using, and/or disclosing Personal Information from or about your child in accordance with your request (for example, for just one activity or for all), but we reserve the right to keep certain information necessary for record-keeping to the extent permitted and/or required by law, including any statutory retention requirements.

We will retain your child’s information for as long as their account is active or as needed to provide services.  We will retain and use their information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  
To make these requests, you may contact Attn: Kids Club Privacy Policy, Jacksonville Jaguars, One EverBank Field Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32202, Email: [kidsclub@jaguars.com](mailto:%20kidsclub@jaguars.com), Phone: (904) 633-2000.

**5\. “LINKED-TO” WEBSITES**

Our Kid Site may contain links or banners that lead to other third party Web sites or online services. We are not responsible for these other sites and services, and so the privacy policies on those sites (not this Policy) will govern the collection and use of information there. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of each Web site visited after leaving our Sites, and of each such third party service used, to learn about how their information is treated by others.

**6\. DATA PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES**

**Information provided to or collected by us on our Kid Sites is transmitted to us and processed in the United States and other countries, either by us or our service providers on our behalf, and will be protected subject to this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in other countries. By allowing their children to use our Kid Site, parents agree to the preceding sentence.**

  
**7\. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICIES**

If we make a material change to our Kids Privacy Policy, we will make reasonable attempts to notify parents of child users by any means permitted by law, and we may require the parent's consent to any new privacy policy.

Parents may contact us with any questions concerning our policies or practices with regard to the collection, use and/or disclosure of their children's Personal Information:
