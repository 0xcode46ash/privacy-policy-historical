Please read this privacy policy carefully, as once you use any of our web sites, you will be deemed to have read and accepted this privacy policy. 

**What personal information is collected?**  
The only personal information we collect about you is information which you provide yourself via forms on our website, or our billing partners websites. (e.g. when you register with us, contact customer support, or sign up for membership). 

No personal information is collected when you access the public areas of our website. 

No personal information is collected when you play our Single Player Games. 

To play our Multiplayer Games you will need to choose a username and password and provide a valid email address. 

To play RuneScape (which includes RuneScape Classic) or use certain areas of our websites you will need to create an account and choose a username and password. 

To subscribe for RuneScape membership you will also need to provide contact information including: your name, a valid email address, gender, home address, phone/fax number, zip/postal code, and country, together with payment details (such as credit card number and expiry date). 

To make use of our customer support service you will need to provide an email address and information relating to your query. To enable us to provide a better customer support service we may also ask you to provide contact information including: your name, email, postcode and country, and to provide a number of security questions which we can use to verify your identity if you require assistance in the future. The questions and the answers you provide are up to you. You may opt-out of providing some of this information but it will limit the effectiveness of our support service if you do. We also sometimes collect and store other information by way of a questionnaire to assist our advertisers and partners. 

You may opt-out of providing any information by simply choosing not to complete the form requesting the information, and hence choosing not to use that particular service. 

**What other information is stored?**  


We use cookies, ip-addresses, and other unique identifiers in order to identify specific computers that access our services. 

We generate and store logs indicating usage of our site and activity in our games. 

We store 'save game' and 'game settings' information to enable us to provide a better games service in which your activities and achievements are remembered in the game. 

**What happens to the information provided/collected?**  


The information may be used: 

a) To process your payment for RuneScape membership subscriptions. 

b) To provide our customer support service, and to verify any claims or requests you make if you use our customer support service. 

c) To enforce our terms and conditions, and prevent hacking activities against our site. 

d) To send service announcements which contain important information about our service, our site, or your account. (for example an email reminder is sent to members if a subscription payment is due). 

e) To aggregate information to generate anonymous statistics regarding use of our services. We may share this anonymous information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

f) For our own internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs 

g) To disclose information to the extent required by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or to enforce legal rights.
