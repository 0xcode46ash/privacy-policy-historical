# Jaunted Privacy Policy || Jaunted

At Jaunted, it is our goal to protect your privacy when you visit or personalize our site and to make your online experience safe and fun. Because we collect certain types of information about you when you visit our site, we have written this policy to share our practices and use of that information.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact Jaunted Support at [help@jaunted.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615142438id_/http%3A//www.jaunted.com/special/help@jaunted.com)

**Types of Information We Collect:**

**1.Anonymous Information**

We collect anonymous information from our users that cannot be associated with a specific individual. For example, we know how many people visit our site, but we dont know their names or any other personal information about them. We collect this type of anonymous data in order to track overall site traffic and the specific pages that people visit most often. This anonymous tracking information is used to build a better service and enhance the content in our most popular areas. Some of this anonymous tracking information is shared with third parties such as advertisers or our partners. 

**2.Personal Information**

We collect personal information when you voluntarily register with our service. Registration is required to access some of the features on our site. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Jaunted website. You can sign up for a user account here. The only personal information collected upon signing up for an account is a working email address.

**The Way We Use Information**

We use your email address only to send a confirmation email when you sign up for an account and to allow you to reset your password if you lose or forget your old one. We also send you an automated notice if a story you submit is accepted or declined. No other use is now or ever will be made of this address, although the administrators may personally email you if extenuating circumstances arise where this is required. We will not send you any other email unless you contact us first and specifically request information, technical help, or editorial assistance. We do not sell this address, or link it to any other personal information. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in, and clicking the "User Preferences" link in the box on the right-hand side of every page. If you are logged in right now, then clicking [this link](https://web.archive.org/my/prefs) will take you to your edit page. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections, by requiring you to enter your current password before changing any of your user information.

**Notification of Changes**

While we dont anticipate any changes in our privacy policy, there is always a possibility of change. However, if there is any substantial change to our policy, we will send e-mail notifications to our members with the opportunity to remove their membership information.
