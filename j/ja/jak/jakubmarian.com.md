# Privacy policy and information about Amazon affiliate marketing links

Thank you for visiting my website. This article tells you how I use personal information collected here. Please read this privacy policy before using the site or submitting any personal information. By using the site, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy.

### Cookies

My website does not use any cookies (but third party services used by the website, such as Disqus for comments, may use their own cookies to fulfil your specific requests).

### Amazon Associates Program

This website is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. This means, in particular, that if you follow a link to amazon.com or any other national version of Amazon website and then buy anything within 24 hours (not just my books), I will receive a small percentage of what you pay to Amazon (but your price will stay exactly the same).

### Collection of Information

I can collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by my visitors. This information is only used to fulfil your specific request, unless you give me permission to use it in another manner. I never share any information with third parties, unless required by the law.

_I reserve the right to make changes to this policy._
