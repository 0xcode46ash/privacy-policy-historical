# Privacy policy and information about Amazon affiliate marketing links

Thank you for visiting my web site. This privacy policy tells you how I use personal information collected at this site. Please read this privacy policy before using the site or submitting any personal information. By using the site, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy.

### Amazon Associates Program

This website is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. This means, in particular, that if you follow a link to amazon.com, amazon.de, amazon.fr, or any other national version of Amazon website, and then make a purchase within a certain time frame, I will receive a small percentage of what you pay to Amazon (but your price will stay exactly the same).

I, however, **never link to specific products just in order to advertize them**. I link only to the products that I genuinely find helpful, and the websites linking to such products express my honest opinion on the products, i.e. I never recommend a product just in order to persuade you to buy it; I recommend it because I myself find it useful.

### Collection of Information

I can collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by my visitors. This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give me permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of my mailing lists.

### Cookie/Tracking Technology

The Site may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site, and understanding how visitors use the Site. Cookies can also help customize the Site for visitors. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.

### Distribution of Information

I may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation. I may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place. The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.

### Commitment to Data Security

Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only I have access to this information. All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.

I reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted.
