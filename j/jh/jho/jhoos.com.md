### User Privacy

Jhoos does not send Spam or sell email addresses.

**About Jhoos and the Information We Collect**

Jhoos is an online social networking community that connects people through networks of friends or making new friends. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network consists of a user's friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these personal networks.

**Information Collected/Tracked by Jhoos**

**Information submitted to Jhoos**

We reserve the right to send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to the Service, or of any Jhoos related products and services. We reserve the right to disclose information about your usage of the Service and demographics in forms that do not reveal your personal identity.

**Information not Directly Submitted by Users to Jhoos**

This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users to the site.

**Use of Information Obtained by Jhoos**

**Information users submit to Jhoos**

Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site as social networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on Jhoos with each other through the Jhoos service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Info.

**Information that users do not submit to us**

We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of our website.

**Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks**

Except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your membership.

**Links**

This site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Jhoos is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Cookies are used to manage sessions on our site. Users must enable cookies to use our site. Also, users may optionally use a cookie to remember their password in order to automatically log in to our site. We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user which they did not intentionally submit to us.

**Correcting/Updating or Removing Information**

Jhoos users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such as Edit Profile and Account Info.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email.

**Invite a Friend**

If you invite another person to join Jhoos, we use the name and email address you provide us to contact that person and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Jhoos. Jhoos stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. Jhoos does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. All invitees are given the option not to receive further invitations from Jhoos.

Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
