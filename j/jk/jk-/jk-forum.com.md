# Project-JK Copyright Information & JK-Forum Privacy Policy

**JK-Forum.com Privacy Policy**  
Last Updated: March 11, 2011   
JK-Forum.com understands and appreciates the importance of how visitor and/or user information is collected and used. Please read the following to learn about our Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of the JK-Forum.com website (the "Site"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the Site, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our [ Forum Rules](http://www.jk-forum.com/faq.php?faq=vb_faq). Due to the evolving nature of the Internet, JK-Forum.com may need to change its Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case the revised Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and the "Last Updated" date will be changed to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after the posting any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified. 

**_Your California Privacy Rights_**  
California Business and Professions Code Section 22575 requires an operators of a commercial website which collects personally identifiable information through the website or online service to post and maintain its privacy policy on its website, including policies related to the collection and storage of personal information (if any) disclosed by the website to third parties for direct marketing purposes. 

**_What Information is Collected About Visitors?_**  
The information that we collect about you while you are using the Site falls into two general categories, as described below. The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf. 

_1\. Information You Provide to Us._  
We may collect, through a variety of technologies and practices, and store information, including personally-identifiable information (such as your name, postal address or e-mail address), or other information, that you voluntarily supply to us either while on the Site or in responding via e-mail in connection with a feature provided on the Site. Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions, information that you publically post in your Profile, in discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information or other private information available for viewing by third parties online - for example in your Profile, in discussion forums, or other community posting or social networking areas of our Site - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.

_2\. Information that is Automatically Collected._  
If you browse through this Site without entering any personal data, we will gather and store certain non-personally identifiable information about your visit. This type of information, which includes the following, does not identify you personally and cannot be linked back to you unless you decide to identify yourself: IP address, the type of browser and operating system used for Site access, the time and date of access, the pages visited, whether you linked to the Site from another website, and additional information related to your visit. The use of the IP address is to help diagnose problems with the Site’s server, and to administer the Site. 

We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you have entered preference information before. 

If you want to limit the non-personally identifiable information that is automatically collected while you use our Site, most web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy settings. Please contact the developer of your specific web browser to determine how to disable cookies.

**_How is this Information Used?_**  
We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including, for example, to process your registration request, provide you with services and communications that you have requested, customize features and advertising that appear on the Site, deliver our Site content to you, measure Site traffic, measure user interests and traffic patterns, and improve the Site and the services and features offered via the Site. 

We will not use the information that we collect while you are using the Site, nor will we authorize third parties to use such information, to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless you have specifically informed us that you would like to receive such promotional offers. Otherwise, we may share information we collect while you are using the Site with our affiliates and with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in providing services. If you do not wish your personally identifiable information to be used or shared for these purposes, send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose contact information is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy. 

Our Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services from a third party Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services. 

Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our [ Forum Rules](http://www.jk-forum.com/faq.php?faq=vb_faq); or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.

**_Storage of Information_**  
All information we gather on our Site is stored within a database to which only we and our hosting services provider are provided access. However, as effective as the reasonable security measures implemented by us may be, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our Site’s servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

**_Questions Regarding Privacy_**  
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, our privacy practices, or your dealings with us, please contact us in writing to: [webmaster](http://www.jk-forum.com/sendmessage.php)
