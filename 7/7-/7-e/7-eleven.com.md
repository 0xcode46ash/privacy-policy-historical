**7-Eleven.com and and Slurpee.com**

**Privacy Policy for Websites and Mobile Applications**

7-Eleven, Inc., ("7-Eleven" or "we") the operator of the 7-Eleven.com and Slurpee.com web sites (the "Site" or "Sites") and certain mobile application(s) ("Apps") is committed to preserving the privacy of those who visit the Sites or who use the Apps. This document will outline how we gather and utilize various sources of information obtained during your visit to the Sites and use the Apps. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected at the Sites and via the Apps and/or via social media. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other data gathered or used by 7-Eleven. 

**Personal and Non-Personal Information:**

When using the Sites and Apps, in order to utilize some of the services, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to submit, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address and telephone number or other information you may provide. We may also leverage social network information (e.g. photos) when we have permission to do so. For example, we may collect information when you connect with 7-Eleven via a social media service, such as Slurpee's or 7-Eleven’s Facebook pages.

Personal Information does not include transactional data related to purchases at 7-Eleven Stores, unless we combine such transaction data with your Personal Information, which we may do. In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information"). Information obtained in connection with the Sites and/or Apps may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Sites and/or Apps, including both offline and online sources.

**Mobile Applications:**

In addition to the information above, the following applies to our mobile applications:

  * Our Apps collect certain information as part of their normal operations, such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID), and information about the way you use the applications. The Apps may also collect certain information you voluntarily provide, such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information, such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer.
  * Our Apps also collect precise information about the location of your device, such as when you search for a store. You must first provide permission through your device before the application obtains such location.



We may disclose or otherwise make available personal information about you to third party service providers that assist us in the design, development and/or operation of our Apps. We may also work with analytic companies to help us understand how our Apps are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. These providers may collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Sites or one of the Apps. The device identifier is used to improve services within our Apps such as barcode scanners. Our service providers may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than for providing the services on our behalf.

You may at any time opt-out of the collection and of your precise location information:

  * You can stop all collection of information by our Apps easily by uninstalling the Apps. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
  * You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
  * Even after you opt out, service providers may collect device-specific information (such as a unique device identifier) when you use our Site. However, the Apps will not collect such information.



**Information Usage:**

We may use the Personal Information we collect to contact you about our products and services or those of our partners or other third parties from time to time. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties or mass marketers. For example, we will not sell to another company your name or email address. Unless you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information, only we and our affiliates, our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Sites and/or Apps available, enhance their functionality, or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in delivering content, samples, products, gifts and prizes, have access to this information, and we do not agree to uses of your Personal Information which are inconsistent with this policy. 

Please note that 7-Eleven reserves the right to and may disclose Personal Information about you in response to (a) requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (b) any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as a subpoena; (c) if required by law; or (d) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, physical threats, or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site’s or Apps’ rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper. Please also note that we do reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of the corresponding Site and/or App assets.

**COPPA:**

Our registration process is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from becoming members of the Sites or users of our Apps and providing us with Personal Information. In the event that our staff becomes aware that Personal Information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will delete such information from our database. Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined using a false age, please notify us for 7-Eleven.com via webmasted@7-11.com and for Slurpee.com via support@slurpeenation.com and we will cancel your child's account and nullify all Personal Information that was collected from him/her via the Sites or an App. If you would like to know more about our Sites, information practices, stored information about your child, or how to close your child's account, please contact us at webmasted@7-11.com, or support@slurpeenation.com. We will happily respond to all email from parents with privacy questions or concerns.

**Links to Third Party Sites:**

Our Sites and Apps may contain links to other web sites, including our affiliated or co-branded web sites. Other web sites may also reference or link to our Sites or Apps. These other web sites are not controlled by 7-Eleven. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Sites or Apps to read the privacy policies of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites or mobile applications. Visiting these other web sites is at your own risk. Please note that if you use the "Share" function available from the Sites or any App, that will lead you to a separate web site or service governed by another party’s privacy policy and terms.

**Cookies:**

Our Sites may pass a "cookie" (a string of information that is sent by a web site to be resident on your system's hard drive, and/or temporarily in your computer's memory blocks). The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a particular page, to retain login information or to otherwise remember preferences and enhance your experience on the Sites. We may allow third parties to set cookies through the Sites in order to help us manage and analyze the performance of the Sites. You may set your browser to decline cookies. If you do so, however, you may not be able to fully experience some interactive features of the Sites.

**Clickstream:**

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Sites. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Sites, how visitors navigate throughout the Sites and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Sites and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information.

**Security:**

7-Eleven will not be liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. We have undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to visitor data retained in our servers, however, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, 7-Eleven cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. Users must accept all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that their Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.

**Social Networking and Public Forums:**

You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online may be viewed collected and used by us and by others, and could be used to personalize your experience. Users of the Sites and Apps are solely responsible for the content of messages they post online including on public forums. These forums include but are not limited to social networking services, chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or other publicly accessible forums which may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information within a public forum that user information may be collected and used by others. The Sites and Apps are unable to control such uses of your Personal Information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed, collected and used by third parties.

The Sites allow users the option to log-on or submit information through Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace and other third party social networking websites via a third party website called Gigya. If you provide your social networking username and password through the Gigya portal, depending on your privacy settings, Gigya pulls your information from that social networking website and makes such information available on the applicable Site. The Gigya website database holds a unique reference ID generated by Gigya for each user that logs in and coordinates information to show the last city the user visited on the site. If you choose to log on to the Sites through Gigya or such third party social networking websites, your Personal Information is subject to the applicable social networking website and your current privacy setting on such social networking website. This information (including without limitation, your name, photographs, geographic location and any status update or text that you provide) may be displayed on the applicable Site as part of the Site’s experience while you are logged on. The Sites have no control over the content or privacy policies of the Gigya website or third party social networking sites. If you choose to log on to a website through Gigya or a third party social networking website, 7-Eleven is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of Gigya or such websites.

**Policy Modifications/Opt-Out:**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use Personal Information in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes. Please check this page periodically for changes to this Privacy Policy.

We give you the choice to no longer receive marketing communications from the Sites and Apps. All unsubscribe or opt-out requests can be handled by logging into your "My Account" profile page on the respective Site.
