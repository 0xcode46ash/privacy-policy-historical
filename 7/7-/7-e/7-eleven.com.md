**7-Eleven.com (www.7-Eleven.com/privacy) and Slurpee.com (www.slurpee.com.com/privacy)**

**Privacy Policy for Websites and Mobile Applications**

7-Eleven, Inc., (“7-Eleven” or “we”) the operator of the 7-Eleven.com and Slurpee.com web sites (the “Site” or “Sites”) and certain mobile application(s) (“Apps”) is committed to preserving the privacy of those who visit the Sites or who use the Apps. This document will outline how we gather and utilize various sources of information obtained during your visit to the Sites and use the Apps. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected at the Sites and via the Apps. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other data gathered or used by 7-Eleven including through web sites not listed above. 

**Personal and Non-Personal Information:**

When using the Sites and Apps, in order to utilize some of the services, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to submit, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address and telephone number or other information you may provide. We may also leverage social network information (e.g. photos) when we have permission to do so. For example, we may collect information when you connect with 7-Eleven via a social media service, such as Slurpee's or 7-Eleven’s Facebook pages.

Personal Information does not include transactional data related to purchases at 7-Eleven Stores, unless we combine such transaction data with your Personal Information, which we may do. In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, duration and frequency of visits, and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual ("Aggregate Information"). Information obtained in connection with the Sites and/or Apps may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Sites and/or Apps, including both offline and online sources. By using the Sites or the Apps you consent to the collection and use of this type of information.

**_Information Collection_ : We and our service providers may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:**

**Through the Services** : We may collect Personal Information through the Sites and Apps, e.g., when you register, sign up for a newsletter, or participate in a promotion.

**Mobile Applications:**  
In addition to the information above, the following applies to our mobile applications

  * Our Apps collect certain information as part of their normal operations, such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID), and information about the way you use the applications. The Apps may also collect certain information you voluntarily provide, such as product information when you scan a bar code, and transactional information, such as when you make a purchase or respond to an offer.
  * Our Apps also collect precise information about the location of your device, such as when you search for a store. You must first provide permission through your device before the application obtains such location.



We may disclose or otherwise make available personal information about you to third party service providers that assist us in the design, development and/or operation of our Apps. We may also work with analytic companies to help us understand how our Apps are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. These providers may collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our Sites or one of the Apps. The device identifier is used to improve services within our Apps such as barcode scanners. Our service providers may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than for providing the services on our behalf.

You may at any time opt-out of the collection and of your precise location information:

  * You can stop all collection of information by our Apps easily by uninstalling the Apps. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
  * You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.
  * Even after you opt out, service providers may collect device-specific information (such as a unique device identifier) when you use our Site. However, the Apps will not collect such information.



**From Other Sources:** We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms; and other third parties. For example, if you connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. In addition, we may supplement the Personal Information that you provide us and/or the Other Information we collect from you with demographic, social, and other information about you that we receive from other sources. Once we combine data from other sources with your Personal Information collected pursuant to this policy, we apply this policy to the combined data as long as it is combined. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the original source or uncombined data

**Information Usage and Disclosure:**

As permitted by applicable law may use the Personal Information we collect to contact you about our products and services or those of our partners or other third parties from time to time. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties or mass marketers. For example, we will not sell to another company your name or email address. Unless you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information, only we and our affiliates, our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Sites and/or Apps available, enhance their functionality, or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in delivering content, samples, products, gifts and prizes, have access to this information, and we do not agree to uses of your Personal Information which are inconsistent with this policy

Please note that 7-Eleven reserves the right to and may disclose Personal Information about you in response to (a) requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (b) any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as a subpoena; (c) if required by law; or (d) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, physical threats, or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site’s or Apps’ rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.

If you are from Canada please review the section in this Policy that explains how your Personal Information may be transferred outside of Canada.

**Cookies:**

Our Sites may pass a "cookie" (a string of information that is sent by a web site to be resident on your system's hard drive, and/or temporarily in your computer's memory blocks). The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a particular page, to retain login information or to otherwise remember preferences and enhance your experience on the Sites. We may allow third parties to set cookies through the Sites in order to help us manage and analyze the performance of the Sites. You may set your browser to decline cookies. If you do so, however, you may not be able to fully experience some interactive features of the Sites.

**Clickstream:**

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Sites. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Sites, how visitors navigate throughout the Sites and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Sites and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information

**Interest Based Advertising:**

We may participate in Interest-based and behavioral advertising. This means that you may see advertising on our website tailored to how you engage, browse or shop, or you may see advertising for 7-Eleven on other websites, applications and social media based on your behavior across websites, applications and social media. We may target ads based on data we have collected, or data provided by third parties alone or in combination with the data we collect ourselves. By using the Sites or the Apps you agree to usage tracking and targeted, behavioral advertising.

You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online may be viewed collected and used by us and by others, and could be used to personalize your experience. Users of the Sites and Apps are solely responsible for the content of messages they post online including on public forums. These forums include but are not limited to social networking services, chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or other publicly accessible forums which may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information within a public forum that user information may be collected and used by others. The Sites and Apps are unable to control such uses of your Personal Information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed, collected and used by third parties.

The Sites allow users the option to log-on or submit information through Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace and other third party social networking websites via a third party website called Gigya. If you provide your social networking username and password through the Gigya portal, depending on your privacy settings, Gigya pulls your information from that social networking website and makes such information available on the applicable Site. The Gigya website database holds a unique reference ID generated by Gigya for each user that logs in and coordinates information to show the last city the user visited on the site. If you choose to log on to the Sites through Gigya or such third party social networking websites, your Personal Information is subject to the applicable social networking website and your current privacy setting on such social networking website. This information (including without limitation, your name, photographs, geographic location and any status update or text that you provide) may be displayed on the applicable Site as part of the Site’s experience while you are logged on. The Sites have no control over the content or privacy policies of the Gigya website or third party social networking sites. If you choose to log on to a website through Gigya or a third party social networking website, 7-Eleven is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of Gigya or such websites.
