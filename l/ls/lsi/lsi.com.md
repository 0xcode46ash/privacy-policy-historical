# Privacy Policy

### Collection and use of information

In general, you can visit this site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you and to tell you what we plan to do with that information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have personally identifiable information used for further contact with you, we will do our best to respect your wishes. If you sign up to receive an electronic newsletter or enter your name on an email list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list.

To improve our website and collect reader profile information, we may ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. We use this information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. You can choose not to supply us with your personal information. In that case, you can still visit most of this site, but you may not be able to access certain offers and services. We will also collect information from you to complete a transaction. In addition, LSI collects information on the domains, IP addresses and Web browsers from which people visit our site. We use this data to track trends in our site traffic and for making improvements. This information is collected on an aggregate basis and is not associated with a particular individual.

LSI and its financial services providers will only use credit card information for payment processing and fraud prevention. The information is stored encrypted using only the last four digits of your credit card. Credit card information will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases.

### Sharing of information

LSI will not sell, rent or lease your personal information except as described in this Privacy Statement or with your consent. LSI shares personal information as follows:

LSI uses service providers and suppliers to deliver products and services and to assist LSI with marketing and communications. Examples of such providers include credit card processors, customer support providers and shipping agents. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information they receive on LSI's behalf and they may not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for LSI.

LSI requires the export of your personal information to other LSI-owned business entities in the US and worldwide in accordance with this Privacy Statement to satisfy your request. Such export is a requirement of providing the information to LSI.

LSI will also share the personal information you provide to LSI with non-LSI third parties without your permission when responding to duly authorized information requests of law enforcement and governmental authorities; complying with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; investigating and helping prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity; and enforcing or protecting the rights and properties of LSI, its subsidiaries, business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.

In the event that LSI decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in the U.S. or worldwide, any such transaction may involve the disclosure and transfer of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers. LSI will seek appropriate protection for such personal information in these types of transactions.

### Linking to other Web sites

This site contains links to other websites. LSI is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content, accuracy or opinions expressed on such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked by us for accuracy or completeness. Inclusion of any linked website on our site does not imply approval or endorsement of the linked website by us. 

### Using cookies

LSI may use cookies on some website pages to help us serve you better. Cookies enable us to provide you with a more valuable experience by telling us which areas of the website are of most interest to you. You can set your browser to warn you before you collect a cookie. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our website but you may be unable to experience all the site's features and functionality.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

If we change this Privacy Statement, we will post the revised statement here, with an updated revision date. If we make significant changes to our statement, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email.
