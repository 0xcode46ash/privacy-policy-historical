Security

_

This site utilizes a secure server to protect your financial information. Secure server software is used to encrypt the financial information sent between your Internet browser and our Internet site. This ensures the security of your financial transaction details when using this site. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us and may, on occasion, request proof of identity before we disclose any professional information to you.

 _

Cookies

_

Some Reed Exhibition web sites use Cookies. Cookies are nothing more than a simple text file. They are not executable programs, and consequently it is impossible for a cookie to contain a virus, or any other application. Cookies are also very small, and you run no risk of filling your hard drive with too many cookies.

The Reed Exhibition Companies Cookie that is placed on your computer contains only your unique reference number that is allocated by the registration process. This consists of a 4-digit number. There is no information in the Cookie that can identify you. The Cookie is only valid when you access the relevant Reed Exhibitions site.

Any queries/questions

_

If you have any questions or concerns about your customer information or your request to opt-out of communications from REC or its third party partners, please contact our Corporate Headquarters via [e-mail](mailto:RECinfo@reedexpo.co.uk) ** __** , telephone (+44 208 271 2120), or FAX (+44 208 910 7823).

 _

E-mail addresses

_

This site recognizes the home servers of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses. Individually identifiable e-mail addresses are not captured or stored unless they are provided. Persons who communicate with REC, and supply us with an e-mail address, may receive future communications by e-mail or telephone. Persons who do not wish to receive e-mail messages may contact REC and ask to be removed; to do so, send an e-mail to [RECinfo@reedexpo.co.uk](mailto:RECinfo@reedexpo.co.uk) __ and specify your name, company name and e-mail address. As such, REC supports the customer's right to "opt-out". E-mail addresses will NOT be sold or disclosed to any other parties. Persons who request information about REC, and who supply us with their name and address will be added to our database to receive the requested information.
