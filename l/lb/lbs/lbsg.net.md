Welcome to our official Privacy Policy! If you have additional questions or seek clarification on anything relating to Lifeboat, please contact us at privacy@lbsg.net.

#### SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION

Thank you for choosing Lifeboat. This is our Privacy Policy. We’d like to explain some of the primary purposes of the Privacy Policy, and how it effects you.

The Privacy Policy is here to fulfill three particular things:

1\. Explain the way we utilize personal information that you share with us in order to create and enhance the services that we provide.  
2\. Ensure that you are aware of what information we collect with your authorization, and how it is used.  
3\. Show that we value your privacy, and strive with great effort to protect it.

#### SECTION 2 – USE OF INFORMATION

You can use most of our game servers without registering, in which case we collect no personal information.

When you register an account on our server network, the only personal information that is required and collected is your username and email address.  We do not collect your physical address to play on our servers.

When you purchase a virtual product, such as VIP, through Apple or Google on the Lifeboat+ app, the only personal information that is required and collected is your username and email address.  We do not collect your physical address to purchase virtual products.  Credit card information is handled by Apple and Google.

When you purchase a product (either physical or virtual) from our website, or purchase part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your username, name, address and email address.  This is also true of no-cost promotional products obtained via our website.

When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

Email marketing: With your permission, we may send you emails about our website, new products, community information and other updates.

#### SECTION 3 – CONSENT

When you provide us with personal information to create an account, complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at privacy@lbsg.net or mailing us at: Hydreon Corporation 6440 Flying Cloud Dr Suite 100, Eden Prairie, MN, 55344, United States.

#### SECTION 4 – DISCLOSURE

We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our [Terms and Conditions](http://lbsg.net/terms-and-conditions/).

#### SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s [Terms and Conditions](http://lbsg.net/terms-and-conditions/).
