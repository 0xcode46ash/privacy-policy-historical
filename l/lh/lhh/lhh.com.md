# Privacy policy - Lee Hecht Harrison

Lee Hecht Harrison, the group of companies it belongs to and our global partner entities want you to feel confident using our Web site and our other online IT tools to which you may have access in the context of the provision of our career transition services (the “Online Tools”). In order to gain your confidence this Privacy Policy has been included online so as to provide you with a clear indication of how we address this important issue.

By visiting this site and using our Online Tools you are agreeing with and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Should you not agree with this Privacy Policy you should cease using the Web site immediately.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as the Web site and its content develops and matures. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy regularly.

**RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY  
**  
If you visit an area of our Online Tools to which you are not required to log on in order to read, browse or download information, we may record the date and time of your visit, the pages visited and any information downloaded. Our Online Tools will not record any information that would identify you personally. If you complete an online registration form via Resume Reserve™ on one of our Online Tools, the information that you enter into the form will only be collected if you actually submit the form.

We may also use the information collected to notify you about changes to our Online Tools, and to inform you of services, opportunities and special events that we believe you will find valuable and, of course, for our coaches/consultants to communicate with you during the course of delivering our services.

From time to time we may also use the information to send you information about us, our related companies and possibly about third parties which may be of interest to you.

We may also use your information to prepare statistical and quality reports on our services and the population we serve without identifying you in the report.

For that purpose and in order to improve our services, we may send you a survey, the answers to which will be shared with our management as well as with your Career Coach. If you would rather not share your name directly with your coach/consultant, elect to remove your name in the appropriate box on the survey. Your feedback will then be given to your Coach anonymously. We also report quality results to employers who sponsor individuals in our programs. However, names are never associated with those quality results provided to your employer. If you have secured a new opportunity, please update your profile in our Career Resource Network. We only use this information in the aggregate, so it is not associated with your name. This information about new jobs is vital to our ability to provide the best service and follow workplace trends. For the sake of clarity, by answering any of our surveys, you consent to the processing of your data as described herein.

We may also use your information to report on the services we perform with you to our relevant client. What we tell them includes: the name of your consultant, program activities in which you participate, and when you complete your program with us. Many clients request regular written feedback from us. If you wish to review the feedback we are providing at any time, please speak to your coach/consultant.

To facilitate our efficient use of your information, and to provide you with the best services and/or opportunities, it may sometimes be necessary for us to disclose your information to third parties. However, this disclosure will only occur in the following circumstances:

\- To our Employees, Contractors and Agents From time to time we may engage or employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include, administrative functions associated with our business activities. Such parties will have access to only that personal information required by them to perform their functions, and they may not use such information for any other purposes.

\- Where required by Law we will share information with government or law enforcement authorities in our sole discretion or as required by law.

\- In the case of employers or recruiters who apply for a password to view resumes that are already posted on the site via Resume Reserve™, their use of the information is subject to the Resume Reserve Terms of Use.

Like most international businesses, we have centralized certain aspects of our data processing activities in accordance with applicable laws, which in many instances will result in the transfer of your personal information from one country to another. The jurisdictions where that information will be processed may or may not have laws that seek to protect personal information. Nevertheless, whenever your personal information is transferred within the group of companies LHH belongs to, your personal information will be processed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
