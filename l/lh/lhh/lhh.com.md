This Website is generally operated from the United States (U.S.). Except as otherwise expressed herein or where the law forbids, it is operated in accordance with United States law. You should be aware that United States privacy law may differ substantially from the relevant laws in your country of residence. In some jurisdictions, United States privacy law is considered inadequate.

**E.U.-U.S. and SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD COMPLIANCE**

LHH complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. LHH has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

In compliance with the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, LHH commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

LHH has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers](http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint.

Please note that if your Privacy Shield complaint is not resolved through the above channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
