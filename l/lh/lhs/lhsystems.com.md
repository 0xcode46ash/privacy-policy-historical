# Privacy policy | Lufthansa Systems

## Content of online offer

The author provides no guarantee in respect of the information provided being current, correct and complete, or of its quality. As a basic principle, any liability claims against the author relating to damages of a material or non-material nature, arising out of the use or non-use of the information offered or through the use of faulty and incomplete information, is excluded, so long as on the part of the author there is no proven deliberate or grossly negligent fault attributable. All offers are subject to change without notice and are non-binding. The author expressly reserves the right - without any specific advance notice - to modify, add to, delete or publish parts of pages or the entire offer, or to discontinue publication on a temporary or permanent basis. 

## References and links

For direct or indirect references to external Internet pages ("links"), not within the area of responsibility of the author, any obligation to accept liability would come into effect only in that case in which the author has knowledge of the content and where it would be technically possible and reasonable to expect him to prevent such use in the presence of illegal contents. Accordingly, the author expressly declares that at the point in time of setting the link the corresponding linked pages were free of any illegal contents. The author has absolutely no influence on the current and future design or on the contents of linked/connected pages. Accordingly, he hereby expressly distances himself from all contents of all linked/connected pages modified after the link has been set. This declaration applies for all links set within the author's own Internet offer and references, and for third-party entries in guest books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by the author. Sole responsibility for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and, in particular, for damages arising out of the use or non-use of such information on offer lies with the party offering the page to which reference is made, and not with that party simply making reference to the publication in question by means of links. 

## Copyright and trademark law

The author has been at pains in all publications to observe the copyrights for the graphic images, sound documents, video sequences and texts used, to make use of graphic images, sound documents, video sequences and texts he has produced himself, or to make use of graphic images, sound documents, video sequences and texts not covered by license. All of the brand and trademarks indicated within the Internet offer which may be protected by third parties are subject, without restriction, to the terms of the trademark law in force in each case, and are covered by the ownership rights of the registered owners. From the fact of their simply being named, the conclusion should not be drawn that trademarks are not protected by third-party rights! The copyright for objects published and produced by the author himself remains entirely with the author of the pages. Any reproduction or use of such graphic images, sound documents, video sequences and texts in other electronic or printed publications is prohibited without the express consent of the author.
