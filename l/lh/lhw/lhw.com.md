We have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make an informed decision about the extent of your use of our site. 

**Simply put:**

  * we will not collect personally identifiable information like your name, e-mail and mailing address and telephone number ("Personal Information") without your knowledge and permission;
  * we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless you have authorized us to do so;
  * we will allow you to view, correct or remove your Personal Information and other information associated with your registration as a user of our site; and
