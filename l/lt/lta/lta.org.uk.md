### Processing Your Personal Information

If you choose to give us personal information, such as your name, contact details and date of birth (for example to process an application or provide you with a subscription to an LTA or related service) then this will be held and processed by the LTA in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.  The LTA may also need to transfer your personal information to its county or island associations, agents or sub-contractors who will use it only to further your legitimate interests (e.g. to organise tournaments).

#### Use of Your Personal Information

The LTA may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to perform the services you have requested (such as providing you with the benefits of membership or providing you with information you have asked for) which may involve contacting you by post or e-mail.

  * to allow the LTA to administer the sport of tennis, for instance by organising tournaments and issuing coach licenses.  
to supply you with non-marketing information about the LTA.

  * to make parts of the website easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.

  * the reasonable purposes of the LTA, acting always within the Data Protection Act 1998. 

  * for the detection of fraud and market research purposes.




If you have consented when submitting your personal data (e.g. through ticking or not ticking a consent box) we may also use your personal data:

  * to market to you LTA and third party products and services and for other purposes as you may have consented to.




### Sensitive Personal Information

Sometimes the LTA will collect and process so-called sensitive personal data relating to you.

**Ethnicity data.**   If collected from you, this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity at the LTA and within the game, and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes. 

**Disability data.**   If collected from you, this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity at the LTA and within the game, and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes. 

**Injuries data.**   This may be collected by the LTA directly from you or via your club e.g. through a tournament withdrawal form. It will be used to assist with tournament results and rankings information and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.  The LTA may also potentially use such data to notify you if it considers that a particular injury may preclude or restrict participation in the game

**Criminal records data.**   The LTA is registered with the Criminal Records Bureau to assist it in ensuring that those who take up appointments do not pose a risk to children.  The LTA may therefore process criminal records data disclosed by the CRB.  This will be processed in accordance with the CRB’s Code of Practice for Registered Persons.
