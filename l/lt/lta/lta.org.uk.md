# Privacy and Cookie Policy - LTA

## Processing Your Personal Information

If you choose to give us personal information, such as your name, contact details and date of birth (for example to process an application or provide you with a subscription to an LTA or related service) then this will be held and processed by the LTA in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The LTA may also need to transfer your personal information to its county or island associations, agents or sub-contractors – who will process it strictly on the LTA's behalf.

_The Board of the Tennis Foundation has adopted LTA policies and references in this policy to the LTA should be read as to include the Tennis Foundation._

### Use of Your Personal Information

The LTA may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to perform the services you have requested (such as providing you with the benefits of British Tennis Membership or providing you with information you have asked for) which may involve contacting you by post or e-mail. 
  * to allow the LTA to administer British tennis, for instance by organising tournaments and issuing coach licences. 
  * to make parts of the website easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. 
  * the reasonable purposes of the LTA, acting always within the Data Protection Act 1998. 
  * to market to you LTA and third party products and services and other purposes as you may have consented to in submitting your personal data. 



We may also use your information for detection of fraud and market research purposes.

### Sensitive Personal Information

Sometimes the LTA will collect and process so-called sensitive personal data relating to you.

#### Ethnicity data

If collected from you, this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity within British tennis, and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.

#### Disability data

If collected from you, this will be used to identify and keep under review equality of opportunity within British tennis, and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes.

#### Medical data

If collected from you (e.g. because you are an elite player who has undergone a musculoskeletal screening test), this may be processed on the LTA’s Electronic Medical Record System (the “EMRS”). The EMRS is a centralised electronic medical records database for elite tennis players, managed by the LTA and implemented to improve the medical care of players and to allow accurate monitoring of injuries. Data may be anonymised and used for research/study/audit purposes to enhance the quality of care received by players.

#### Injuries data

This may be collected by the LTA directly from you or via your club e.g. through a tournament withdrawal form. It will be used to assist with tournament results and rankings information and (anonymously) for statistical and reporting purposes. If you are an elite player, injuries date may also be processed on the EMRS.

#### Anti-doping

If you are an elite player who is required to participate in doping control procedures undertaken by a doping control officer appointed by UK Sport or the LTA, the results of such procedures may be used in results management, including associated disciplinary hearings, appeals and adjudications.

#### Criminal records data

The LTA is registered with the Criminal Records Bureau to assist it in ensuring that those who take up appointments do not pose a risk to the children in its care. The LTA may therefore process criminal records data disclosed by the DBS (formerly known as CRB). This will be processed in accordance with the DBS (formerly known as CRB)’s Code of Practice for Registered Persons.

### Cookies

Information may be sent to your computer in the form of an Internet "cookie" to allow the LTA servers to monitor your requirements. The cookie is stored on your computer. The LTA server may request that your computer return a cookie to it. These return cookies do not contain any information supplied by you or any personally identifiable information about you.

Such measures are necessary to allow the LTA to measure the usability of the systems, which will help in its continuing development to ensure that we understand the requirements of British tennis. Your browser software should however enable you to block cookies if you wish to. For more information about cookies, please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.lta.org.uk/Templates/Public/Items/www.allaboutcookies.org).

### Consent

By submitting your personal information to us, you signify your consent to our using the information provided in the manner described above. If we amend our privacy policy, it will be published on this web site. If at any time you wish to update the information which we hold about you, or if you wish to stop receiving information from the LTA, please contact [dataprotection@LTA.org.uk](mailto:dataprotection@LTA.org.uk).
