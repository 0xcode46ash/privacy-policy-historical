1.Does LTD offer secure online ordering?

**

Yes, we do. All customer and order information is securely stored behind a firewall and protected from unauthorized access. Since our online order form does not request any personal information, such as credit card or checking account information, the encryption and verification mechanisms used to secure that type of information are not necessary.

**2.What kind of information do you collect from me when I visit your web site?**

We do not collect any information from those merely visiting our site. We do ask for additional information if you would like to place an order, request an order status or a free catalog, or if you need to communicate with us regarding an account issue.

**3.Does LTD share information it collects from me with outside parties?**

Any information provided by a customer on the web site is used solely to fulfill a product order, a catalog request or research a customer inquiry. The information that you provide is stored in house (separate from the Internet) and is used exclusively to ensure fulfillment of your order, request or inquiry.

**4.What are "cookies" and how do you use them?**

"Cookies" are small bits of information that are sent from the Web server and kept on your browser. They are used by the Web server so it can remember who you are as you browse from page to page of our website.

The cookie we send to your browser is not written to any file on your computer. It is only kept in memory and goes away when you exit your browser program. The content is simply a single number that helps us remember your order information and the contents of your shopping cart.

You need to have cookies enabled on your browser to use our online ordering system.
