# Privacy Policy - LCPDFR.com

Privacy Policy  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available in our footer and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on this website's web servers. Log files do not capture personal information but do capture the user's IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web servers.

 **Private Messaging**  
All messages sent using our private messaging system are private. Staff do not monitor the private messaging system. However, when we receive a report concerning abuse of the private messaging system we may be forced to access such messages for security reasons and to protect our members from spam/abuse.

 **LCPDFR Server Communication**  
LCPDFR interacts with our servers to deliver personalised content, crime statistics and additional multiplayer features. All interaction does not send any system data which could be used to personally identify you as a person to our servers, apart from your IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web servers.  
Downloading of LCPDFR marks your consent for this communication to occur.

 **Tracking**  
G17 Media tracks all site visits across its network to ensure we're delivering the best service possible and to alert of us of any possible problems. No sensitive data is transferred to us. Although this is internal and not shared, some people may be uncomfortable with such tracking. For this reason, we have an opt-out option, which is available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

 **Cookies**  
This website does not store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify individual users of this service without their permission. Any cookies that may be used by this website are used either solely on a per session basis or to maintain user preferences. Cookies are not shared with any third parties.
