# About Your Privacy

**Your Privacy  **   
At L.L.Bean, we believe that understanding what our customers want for products, services and information is an important part of building an interesting and useful online environment. 

We've designed our site with this belief in mind, and we've created this privacy statement so that you have easy access to information about our privacy practices.

**Information we collect online**     
In several areas of our site, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. These areas include: 

  * Checkout, where we ask for name, address, email, credit card and other information needed to complete your order 
  * Catalog requests, where we ask for a name and address 
  * The L.L.Bean Visa® application, where we ask for name, address and financial information that MBNA, the issuer and administrator of the credit card program, needs to process your application 

As part of registering at llbean.com, we give you the option of saving your credit card information for faster online ordering. Once you've registered, click the [My Account](https://www.llbean.com/msprotect/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/general/thankyou.d2w/report?nav_url=/customerService/privacy//index.html) link (at the top of any page) to edit or delete your personal information. Be assured that all information relating to our customers is stored in a highly secure environment, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. 

When you subscribe to LLB-Mail, we ask you to provide a name, email address and profile information. We use this information to fulfill your request and, in the case of profile information, to help make sure we're sending you the type of email updates you want to receive. For more about email, see How we use email below. 

We give you the option of providing a personal greeting to accompany your order, either in a Gift Card (included with Gift Boxes) or in a Gift Message. We make no use of the information contained in these greetings except to complete your order as you have requested.

In order to make improvements to our site, we may gather information that helps show how customers use the site. For example, we might do research to determine which areas are accessed most frequently.

**Information we do not collect**     
When you visit our site, we do not collect your name, email address or any other personal information unless you provide it to us. If you create an Address Book to store names and addresses of friends and family members, we do not make any use of this information except to provide it to you after you've logged in with your User Name and Password. We do not follow your browsing path outside of llbean.com.

**How we use the information we collect**     
L.L.Bean has a strong tradition of providing quality goods and excellent customer service. At llbean.com, our goal is not only to carry on this tradition, but also to provide an experience that is unique to the dynamic capabilities of the World Wide Web. 

Part of achieving this goal involves working with information that helps us understand what customers want when they visit llbean.com. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze customer information in aggregate – that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to llbean.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual customer. Second, we may use information gathered during a customer's visit to help customize his or her next experience on the site. For instance, if you buy a pair of hiking boots during one visit, we might offer you a link to other hiking equipment the next time you visit llbean.com.  In the end, we hope to tailor our site to fit your needs – so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want. 

If you request a catalog or place an order on our site, we will send you catalogs periodically. See below if you do not wish to receive these mailings. For information on email, see How we use email below.

**Cookies  – what they are and how we use them**   
A cookie is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site to give you a unique ID. Cookies help make it easier for you to use our site, and they help us customize your experience so that we can provide you with the information you need – when and where you need it. 

A cookie generated by our site contains a numeric ID that, for example, allows you to retrieve your Shopping Cart on a return visit. We also use cookies to help us measure the success of our marketing efforts, so that we can better understand how to reach you and customers like you with information about llbean.com.  In keeping with our standard policy on customer information, we analyze data gathered via cookies only in aggregate, not at the individual customer level.

**How we use email**     
After you place an order on our site, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information. You will receive these emails only if you have provided your email address during checkout or when registering. Recipients of our Electronic Gift Certificate receive an email notifying them of the gift and giving them the information they need to redeem it.

We send LLB-Mail, our email update on sales and products, to subscribers and occasionally to other customers who we think might be interested in learning about sales and special events at our site. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each edition of LLB-Mail.

Please note that we do not sell or share email addresses with other companies. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our customers, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/customerService/contactUs/index.html) with your questions or comments. We read every email we receive.

**Links to other sites**  
Occasionally we provide links to other sites we think you will enjoy. These sites operate independently of L.L.Bean and have established their own privacy and security policies. For the best online experience, we encourage you to review these policies when you visit other sites.

**Information we may share with others**     
If you provide us with your name and postal address, we may make it available to other companies who want to tell you about their products. (See below if you prefer that we not share this information.) In delivering this information, we may group you with other customers who have bought similar amounts and types of products, but we never provide details that are specific to a single customer or household.  
  Return to top 

    
**Information we do not share with others**     
L.L.Bean does not share, sell or trade email addresses, information collected as part of a survey or specific details about you or your household. We do not contribute to or participate in shared or cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your personal information. We do not release credit card or financial information for use by other companies (except in the case of financial information included in the online L.L.Bean® VISA® application, which we provide to MBNA, the issuer and administrator of the program). For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. (See [About Security]() for details.)
