Further, if you register for an LLLID in order to participate on the Mother to Mother Forums, we may ask for your email address, and you may decide to create an online profile, which includes your name, contact information, and other personal information about you.  In addition, when you place an order through LLLI’s online store, become an LLLI Member through online registration, or make a donation to LLLI through the Website, we may ask you to provide your name, contact information, and billing information, which includes your credit card number.  Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

What About Cookies and Web Beacons?

LLLI and certain of our service providers working on the Website use technologies such as cookies and web beacons to enhance the information we have about your preferences and to learn about your visit.  A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  A cookie allows LLLI to determine that a visit has occurred within our Website, as well as which pages were viewed.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies by configuring your preferences option within your web browser.  If you choose to decline cookies, however, some of the functionality of this Website may be impaired.

Web beacons, also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs, allow us to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page.  These electronic images help us analyze our visitors’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Website and our marketing.  This technology tells us information about your visit to www.llli.org, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website.  This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer.    
Web beacons and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from LLLI. 

These website visitation statistics are collected in aggregate form and never linked with personal information about you.  We do not use web beacons or cookies to access personal information about you.  Rather, these are tools we use to gather aggregated statistics about www.llli.org Website usage.

We may work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet.  These companies may collect information about your visits to our Website and your interactions with our advertising and other communications.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having information about you used by these companies, please feel free to contact LLLI to obtain additional information through one of the means listed in the section entitled, “How Can You Contact LLLI?”, below.

What if You Live Outside the United States?

Like almost every website, this Website is accessible around the world.  By visiting this Website and providing your information, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information can be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.  We process and store your information in North America and your information may be stored on servers located outside your residential jurisdiction and which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own.  If you access this Website from outside the United States, your usage of this Website constitutes consent to the transfer of your data outside of your country and to North America. 

####   
What Information is Collected from Children?

LLLI is concerned about children’s privacy.  This Website is not targeted to or intended for use by children under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent and unless expressly identified on specific pages of our website.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personally identifiable information of any kind whatsoever.

####   
How do we Protect Personally Identifiable Information Collected on this Website?

LLLI is committed to protecting the security of the personal information you provide through www.llli.org.  We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 

Additionally, our secure server encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us so that no outside sources may capture it.  Specifically, when you enter personal information on our Website in connection with purchasing items from our store, making a donation, registering for membership or requesting an LLLID, we use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to LLLI.  To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the URL, or Location line of your browser.  If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from “http” to “https.”

Once you have placed your online order, made a donation, or registered for membership, and your credit card has been authorized for the purchase, donation, or registration, your credit card information is deleted.  All of your future orders will require you to input your credit card information again.  We recognize that this may seem redundant, however, this process ensures your security.  That said, your credit card information is stored if you make recurring donations.  This information is stored by Blackbaud Sphere software, a service technology platform and social CRM (Constituent Relationship Management) that LLLI uses for all donations, and a few employees have limited access to this information.

 LLLI is VeriSign certified to ensure your security on the web.  Simply click the VeriSign symbol on our Website to confirm our certification.

While we implement the above security measures on this website, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible, and that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.  If you are not comfortable shopping online, making a donation, or registering for membership at our Website, please feel free to place your order with us through one of the methods listed in the section entitled, “How Can You Contact LLLI?” below. 

####   
What if You Need to Change the Personal Information We Collect?

LLLI prefers to keep the personal information it collects as accurate and up-to-date as possible.  To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to access and update or modify the information you provide LLLI by contacting us directly at fdassociate@llli.org, or through one of the other methods listed below in the section entitled, “How Can You Contact LLLI?” In addition, on the LLLI website, you may register and create a LLLID.  When you submit your email address to create the LLLID, we will send a message to that address with an email verification link.  Once you have created your LLLID and verified your email address, you may set your password, create a personal profile, and manage your Website activity.  Your personal information contained within your profile can be accessed on the Website once you sign in with your LLLID and password, which then allows you to make updates or modifications to that information.
