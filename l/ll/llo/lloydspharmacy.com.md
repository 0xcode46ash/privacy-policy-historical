 Please note, this website may contain links to other websites which are provided for your convenience. We are only responsible for the privacy practices and security of this site. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website that you visit.

BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND GIVING YOUR INFORMATION TO US, YOU INDICATE YOUR CONSENT TO US, OUR GROUP AND THIRD PARTIES COLLECTING AND USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SET OUT IN THIS POLICY

  
 **THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

In order to provide you with the services you require, we will collect personal information about you from our website, telephone conversations, emails and written and verbal communications. These will include, for example, your name, address, email address, phone number and details that are relevant to the service(s) in which you are interested. 

We may also collect sensitive personal data concerning health matters from or about you if you register for My Health service.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as other companies in our group.

  **Information about other people**

 If you provide information to us about any person other than yourself, you must ensure that they understand how their information will be used and that you are authorised to disclose it to us, and to consent to its use on their behalf, before doing so.

 

 **Cookies**

 In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on this site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and they are used to record how you navigate this website on each visit.

Our cookies are used to enable us to develop our website to reflect our customers interests and by noting who has seen which pages, properties and advertisements (including click through from emails), how frequently particular pages are visited and determining the most popular areas of our website. We may use cookies to enrich your experience of using the website by allowing us to tailor what you see to what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to the site.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies being stored. Please note, if you do turn cookies off this will limit the service that we are able to provide to you and may affect your visitor experience.

For further information on cookies and how to switch them off see [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

  
**HOW WE WILL USE YOUR INFORMATION**

  
All personal information that we obtain about you and/or any other person whose details you provide will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation, our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/wps/portal/termsandconditions) and this Privacy Policy. We will primarily use the personal information:

 to provide the services you request from us   
 to communicate with you in the event that any services requested are unavailable or if there is a query or problem with your order  
 for record keeping purposes   
 to carry out market research so that we can improve the services we offer   
 to track and analyse activity on our website   
 to create an individual profile for you so that we can enhance your user experience,  to understand and respect your preferences and to provide details of relevant offers and opportunities where you have agreed to receive them

 **Disclosing your personal information**

In order to provide our products and services, we may, occasionally, appoint other organisations to carry out some of the processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, our panel of medical experts, technology hosts, printing companies and mailing houses. In these circumstances, we will ensure that personal information is properly protected and that it is only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **OFFERS AND OPPORTUNITIES**

  
We, our group and carefully selected third parties would like to contact you and/or any person whose information you provide to us to tell you and/or them about offers and opportunities that are available and about a range of other initiatives in a number of ways, including by post, telephone, text/picture/video message or by email.   Details of how to opt-in to receiving details of offers are on relevant pages of this website.  You can change your/their mind at any time (see the section "How to contact us" below).

  
 **SECURITY**

We take the security of personal information seriously.  We employ security technology, including firewalls, and Secure Socket Layers to safeguard information and have procedures in place to ensure that our paper and computer systems and databases are protected against unauthorised disclosure, use, loss and damage. 

  
**USE OF YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION**

  
Some of the organisations to which we may disclose personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your/their personal information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that the information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy.

 **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

 Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards.  Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review. We may, from time to time, update our security and privacy policies and suggest that you check this page periodically to review our latest policies.

 **UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION**

You may update or correct your personal information online in the My Health profile area or by contacting us in writing or by email (see the section "How to contact us" below). Please include your name, address and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes.  If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.

  **YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

 

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you.  The same right applies to any other person whose personal information you provide to us. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request made. The current fee is £10.00.
