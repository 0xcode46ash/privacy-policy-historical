# Privacy & Security

**INTRODUCTION**

The LNT website is operated and maintained by Torrey Commerce, Inc. which is solely responsible for its management, your privacy and the website content. The Linens ‘N Things website is part of the Sequential Brand Group Family of Sites (“SBG Family”).  Linens ‘N Things, LNT Brands LLC, Sequential Brands Group, and Torrey Commerce, Inc. (collectively, the “Site,” “Linens ‘N Things” or “LNT.com”) respect the privacy of every individual who visits our websites or responds to our interactive communications.  By visiting LNT.com, you are accepting the practices described in this policy.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the information we collect when you visit the LNT.com website or respond to our interactive communications, and how we use that information. This Policy will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit the Linens ‘N Things Site or respond to our interactive communications. 

 This Policy was last updated on January 13, 2015.

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

**_Voluntary Information_**

You may visit and interact with the Linens ‘N Things Site without providing any personal information.  Currently, Linens ‘N Things does not automatically collect what it considers personally identifiable information about you (your name, age, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) unless you provide that information to us voluntarily.  For example, if you use the “contact us” section of the Site, we ask for your name and email address This is all the information we require to respond to your query. .  If you use our gift registry, we may ask you to create an account.  If you want to have things sent to you, you may also choose to provide us with your postal address and information about where you shop.  This information is not mandatory, however, and you will not be required to complete it in order to hear from an Linens ‘N Things representative.  If you contact us through email communication, your email address and any relevant information contained in your email will also be collected. 

We also collect information from other sources, including from social media and other websites associated with LNT.com.  For example, if you post a comment on the Linens ‘N Things Facebook page or send us a tweet or message on Twitter, we may collect that information as described in this Policy.  Please note that we may combine or cross-reference this information with other information that we collect about you and use it as described in this Policy.

If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us.  If you have already submitted this information and would like us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the postal or email address listed in this Policy.  When you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may use that information to improve the content of the Site, to notify you about updates to our websites, special offers, promotions, and/or to contact you for marketing purposes.  This information will not be shared for commercial purposes with other companies or organizations not affiliated with Linens ‘N Things or its brand group.  However, in order to improve your customer experience, this information is shared with our SBG Family of websites and any third party service providers we use to maintain the sites or to process order information, all of which may be viewed [here](http://www.sequentialbrands.com/).

We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that:  the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers, or others.

LNT.com makes commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all state and federal laws, including CAN-SPAM.  If you do not want to receive email from us in the future, you may opt out by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the email you receive.  You may also contact us at the postal and/or email address listed in this Policy and request that you not receive digital communications from Linens ‘N Things or its affiliated websites.  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete your information from our active files, provided, however, that we may retain — for legal compliance purposes only — your request and associated email in a hashed format so that we do not inadvertently restore your information to our database.

In the event Linens ‘N Things conducts an online promotion, contest, or sweepstakes, information we collect will be used consistent with the terms and conditions outlined in the promotion guidelines or rules, which may include a reference to this Policy.  If the promotion involves the collection of your mobile phone number, you will be provided a check-box at the promotion site to opt-in to receiving text messages outside of the promotion, and you need only text “stop” in reply to any message you receive in order to opt out.  Linens ‘N Things complies with the Telephone Communications Privacy Act, and will not contact you unless you have expressly opted in to receive messages from us.

**_Automatically Collected Information_**

We collect information that is not personally identifiable when you visit our Site. This includes the Internet browser you are using, general geolocation data saved on the device from which you access our Site (if you have enabled it), the computer operating system you are using, time spent visiting our websites, usage patterns within our websites, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our Site or advertisement.  It may also include aggregate information about our users, such as the number of users visiting the site or a portion of the site, all of which may be shared with third parties. 

**_Automatically Stored Information_**

We may store some information on your computer.  This information will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file and will help us improve your experience on the Linens ‘N Things Site in many ways.  A “cookie” is a small bit of digital information that tells us where you go within our site, and may also include information about where you have been on the Internet.  Cookies allow us to tailor the Site and interactive advertisements to better match your interests and preferences.  With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please refer to your browser’s instructions or “help” screen to learn more about these functions.  Note, however, that if you choose to erase cookies, your experience may not be optimized on this Site.

**_Making a Purchase_** __

The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and Linens ‘N Things makes commercially reasonable efforts to help protect the security of information you provide online in connection with a purchase.

As do many companies, Linens ‘N Things uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to help keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being decoded by anyone other than us.

If you choose to make a payment through PayPal, or Amazon, both of which are options for payment, you will be redirected to the Amazon or PayPal website and your information will be handled in accordance with the terms and privacy conditions you agreed to when you created your Amazon or PayPal account.  If you choose to make a payment directly through the Linens ‘N Things, you will be using our trusted financial partners who use the SSL technology.

Making a purchase from the Linens ‘N Things site means, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection because the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".  If you are accessing our site from a browser or internet connection that does not allow SSL encryption.  While we cannot guarantee that our security measures are 100% secure, we use this SSL technology to protect your information.

If you are accessing the site from outside the U.S., you may be connected to servers located within the United States or to servers whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to the laws in your country.  When you provide this information to us, you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to servers and to facilities that may be outside of your country of residence and will be handled and processed in accordance with U.S. law.

We may work with third parties for international shipping purposes and you may be required to submit credit card and contact information to a third party to complete your order.  Once you’ve completed your order, our third party shipping and processing partner will communicate with us about the status of your order, its approval status, and provide us with other information that may be relevant to the transaction.  In many cases for international shipping, our trusted shipping partner must take title to the shipment and arrange for proper duties and taxes so that your order can be delivered to you.  If you agree that information from your order may be shared with Linens ‘N Things, we will apply the same protection to your information as set forth in this policy.

**_For California Residents_**

The California Online Privacy Protection Act requires that we outline our practice as it is related to federal do-not-track signals that may come from your browser.  Because this signal does not often reflect the preference of our consumers, this website does not respond to it.  Users may, however, request to unsubscribe, as discussed earlier in this Policy.

California residents may also request a record of all personally identifiable information we have on file, as well as a list of all third parties in the event Linens ‘N Things has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To obtain this information, please contact us at:

  
Torrey Commerce, Inc.

8400 Miramar Road, Suite 290

San Diego, CA  92126

www.torreycommerce.com

Please include the phrase “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or on the envelope or post card and in the actual request.  For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.  We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile.  We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

**CHILDREN’S ACCESS**

Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its revisions in 2013, the Linens ‘N Things Site is a general audience website, intended for adult use.  Linens ‘N Things does not market to, and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from, children under thirteen (13) years of age.  Please contact our customer service department if you are aware of any personal information supplied to the Site by a child under the age of thirteen (13).

To the extent any website that is part of the SBG Family of Sites does collect information from children, any children’s information is not shared with SBG’s general use websites, including this Linens ‘N Things Site.

**LINKS TO AND ACCESS TO OTHER SITES**

From time to time, Linens ‘N Things may feature websites unaffiliated with it.  Those sites may have their own privacy policies, or no privacy policies at all.  You will be notified when you are being redirected to another site, and accessing these links takes you out of the Linens ‘N Things environment.  Linens ‘N Things has no control over or responsibility for any unaffiliated third party sites or the content contained in them, and we provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors.  LNT.com does not sponsor, endorse, or otherwise recommend such sites or any products or services they may offer.

If you are linked to a site that is part of the SBG Family, please check the privacy policy on that site.
