# JustGive.org - About Us | Privacy

JustGive and the nonprofit organizations listed on our site understand your concerns about privacy on the Internet and take them very seriously. Online giving through us is strictly permission-based: _**You**_ control the use of your name, your personal information, and your donation. 

Like other nonprofit organizations dependent on visitors, such as museums and libraries, we will collect only aggregate information on the number and frequency of visits to various parts of our site so we can make improvements and increase your satisfaction with our services. This type of information is also helpful to the nonprofit organizations listed on our website since they, too, can use the aggregate data to improve their own services. 

Our goal is to connect you with the charities that you care about in the most convenient, secure manner possible. 

  * We never sell, share, or disclose any personal information about you.
  * When you donate to a charity through us, we collect only enough information about you to process your donation. Even then, we will not disclose your name, email address, or other personal information to the charity without your permission.
  * As our credit card processing company, Cybersource is not authorized to retain, share, store, or use your personal information.



JustGive uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) online technology, which encrypts the data you provide. This means that sensitive information, such as your credit card number, becomes unreadable to anyone who wrongly intercepts the information. SSL is supported by all major Web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. The site becomes locked while you are giving us your credit card information and unlocks only when you leave the secured area. To know when you are going to a secure area of a website, you can set your browser to notify you. (If you are using Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options > Advanced, and scroll down to the section called Security. Then check the box that says "Warn if changing between Secure and not Secure mode.") Other ways to know if you are in a secure mode is to look for a gold key or a gold padlock in the bottom right-hand corner of your browser window. Also, when you are in a secure area, the address bar at the top of your window will indicate "https" as opposed to "http."

_Please Note:_ We may update our policy in the future. If we do, we will post the updated information immediately. For more information, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about-us/contact/index.jsp).
