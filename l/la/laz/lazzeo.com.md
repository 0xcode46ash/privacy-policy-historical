# Privacy Policy - Earn Cash From Your Lazzeo Profile

**Version: 7/08/2010**

We want to protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Lazzeo's services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address. You can find more details about the data we collect on particular services by clicking the links on the side of this page. 

**Data Collection**

Lazzeo receives your email address upon registration. Our Lazzeo service requires that your email address be associated with a Lazzeo account. Our use of this information is limited to providing the Lazzeo service. We will ask for your consent before we use this information for any other purpose. 

Lazzeo collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser and the account you are logged in as if any. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 

Basic Lazzeo services do not require you to register for an account and provide your name to us, but some advanced Lazzeo services, such as adjusting notification options, do. 

If you do choose to register to receive additional Lazzeo services, Lazzeo asks you for some personal information in order to register your account (such as your name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. For certain services, we may request credit card or other payment information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. 

When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us. 

**Lazzeo**

When you log in to Lazzeo, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. Lazzeo does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Lazzeo features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

**Information Sharing**

We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances: 

* We have your consent.   
* We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.   
* Where Lazzeo has an existing agreement with a third party which restricts the use of your information only to substantially the same purpose for which the third party uses it on Lazzeo, in the event of Lazzeo' bankruptcy or termination of its relationship with this third party, Lazzeo may provide access to your email.   
* We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Lazzeo, its users or the public. 

If you have an account, we may share the information submitted under your account among all of our services in order to provide you with a seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services. We will not disclose your account information to other people or non-affiliated companies, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy or with your consent. 

We may store and process personal information collected on our site in the United States or any other country in which Lazzeo, LP. or its agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country. 

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Lazzeo, LP., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We may share aggregated information with others. An example of this would be the number of people who saved particular content to Lazzeo. 

**Information Security**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 

We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.   
**  
Updating Your Information**

We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information for many of our services. For more information, please see the help pages for each service. 

**Links**

The sites linked to by Lazzeo's services are developed by people over whom Lazzeoexercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. 

**Changes To This Policy**

Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent notice. Each version will be noted at the top of the page.
