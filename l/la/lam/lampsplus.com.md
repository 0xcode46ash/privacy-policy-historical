Security  
---  
  
> At LAMPS PLUS, we understand your concerns about security and privacy. We protect sensitive information you give us, such as credit card numbers, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you share with us. This process makes it statistically much safer to shop with us than to use your card in a restaurant or store. This encryption applies to users viewing our site using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher, Netscape Navigator 2.0 or higher, or America Online 3.0 or higher.

---  
  
> Like many other online retailers, LAMPS PLUS uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a small bit of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive that we use to help us retrieve data you may have stored with us. For example, in our sections “My Portfolio” and “Projects”, we use cookies to help us retrieve the lighting products that you have saved in these areas. The “Help” portion on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to delete your computer’s cookies or how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the LAMPS PLUS website, and we recommend that you leave the feature turned on.

> You can visit most of the pages on LAMPS PLUS without ever telling us who you are. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but individual site visitors remain anonymous, unless, at some point, you tell us who you are.

> When you purchase a product, subscribe to a service, register to receive mailings or participate in sweepstakes and promotions, you are asked to provide certain information about yourself. This may include some or all of the following: your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, etc. We also maintain a record of your online product purchases. Without providing the above information, you may be unable to order products or access certain services.
> 
> We use the personal information about you for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order. We do not share or sell your information to third parties. All information is kept strictly confidential and will never be sold to any other company. We do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, LAMPS PLUS or to others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.  
>  If you purchase something from us, we may occasionally send out e-mails to our customers to announce special events or sales. If you wish to be removed from our e-mail list please send a request to [Sales@LAMPSPLUS.com](mailto:sales@LAMPSPLUS.com).
