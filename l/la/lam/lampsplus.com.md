# LAMPS PLUS Security and Privacy Policy

> You can visit most of the pages on LAMPS PLUS without ever telling us who you are. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but individual site visitors remain anonymous, unless, at some point, you tell us who you are.
> 
> When you purchase a product, subscribe to a service, register to receive mailings or participate in sweepstakes and promotions, you are asked to provide certain information about yourself. This may include some or all of the following: your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, etc. We also maintain a record of your online product purchases. Without providing the above information, you may be unable to order products or access certain services.
> 
> We use the personal information about you for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order. We do not sell your information to any third parties. All information is kept strictly confidential and will never be sold to any other company. We do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, LAMPS PLUS or to others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.
> 
> If you purchase something from us, we may occasionally send out e-mails to our customers to announce special events or sales. If you wish to be removed from our e-mail list, please visit the [LAMPS PLUS E-Mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20040623054548id_/http%3A//www.lampsplus.com/htmls/newsletter/email/index.aspx) page and follow the screen directions, or you may call 1-800-782-1967. Opt-out instructions are also included with each piece of LAMPS PLUS e-mail.
> 
> If you choose to remove your e-mail address from our mailing list, LAMPS PLUS, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM legislation, may occasionally supply a list of removed e-mail addresses to our advertising partners. This is done to ensure that those e-mail addresses do not receive new advertising offers from us through our advertising partners.
> 
> In addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide services, products, sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.
> 
> When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
> 
> We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you (such as age, gender, and types of products purchased) with business partners to fulfill contractual obligations. Except as described above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online to any unaffiliated third party.
