###   
Security  
  
---  
  
> At LAMPS PLUS, we understand your concerns about security and privacy. We protect sensitive information you give us, such as credit card numbers, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you share with us. This process makes it statistically much safer to shop with us than to use your card in a restaurant or store. This encryption applies to users viewing our site using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher, Netscape Navigator 2.0 or higher, or America Online 3.0 or higher.

###   
Fraudulent Charge Protection  
  
---  
  
> LAMPS PLUS offers a "Safe Shopping Guarantee." If a third party obtains your personal information from a purchase made with LAMPS PLUS and uses that information to perpetrate credit card fraud, you are protected. Under the **Fair Credit Billing Act** , your bank may hold you liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank holds you liable for any portion of the $50, LAMPS PLUS will cover up to the entire $50. 
> 
> LAMPS PLUS will cover this liability if the unauthorized use resulted through no fault of yours from purchase made on the LAMPS PLUS secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

### Cookies  
  
---  
  
> Like many other online retailers, LAMPS PLUS uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a small bit of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive that we use to help us retrieve data you may have stored with us. For example, in our sections “My Portfolio” and “Projects”, we use cookies to help us retrieve the lighting products that you have saved in these areas. The “Help” portion on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to delete your computer’s cookies or how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the LAMPS PLUS website, and we recommend that you leave the feature turned on.
> 
> LAMPS PLUS may occasionally use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous and is not relatable to you. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our advertising service providers. However, LAMPS PLUS respects your privacy and your right to choose whether to be included in such services. If you would like more information or would like to learn about your ability to opt-out of this type of practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). If you choose to opt-out, an "opt-out cookie" will be placed on your computer. If the cookie is removed or deleted, if you upgrade your browser or if you visit us from a different computer, you will need to return to the link above to re-select your preferences.

### Privacy  
  
---  
  
> You can visit most of the pages on LAMPS PLUS without ever telling us who you are. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but individual site visitors remain anonymous, unless, at some point, you tell us who you are.
> 
> When you purchase a product, subscribe to a service, register to receive mailings or participate in sweepstakes and promotions, you are asked to provide certain information about yourself. This may include some or all of the following: your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, etc. We also maintain a record of your online product purchases. Without providing the above information, you may be unable to order products or access certain services.
> 
> We use the personal information about you for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order. We do not sell, rent or share e-mail addresses with any third parties. However, to serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in our stores or through our catalogs, including personal information about you and/or your order. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our Select Partners and other persons or companies whom we have deemed to be trustworthy and responsible and whose privacy policies are aligned with ours. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and that will allow Select Partners and other persons or companies to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at [opt-out@LampsPlus.com](mailto:opt-out@LampsPlus.com). We do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, LAMPS PLUS or to others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.
> 
> If you purchase something from us, we may occasionally send out e-mails to our customers to announce special events or sales. If you wish to be removed from our e-mail list, please visit the [LAMPS PLUS E-Mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200648id_/http%3A//www.lampsplus.com/htmls/newsletter/email/index.aspx) page and follow the screen directions, or you may call 1-800-782-1967. Opt-out instructions are also included with each piece of LAMPS PLUS e-mail.
> 
> If you choose to remove your e-mail address from our mailing list, LAMPS PLUS, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM legislation, may occasionally supply a list of removed e-mail addresses to our advertising partners. This is done to ensure that those e-mail addresses do not receive new advertising offers from us through our advertising partners.
> 
> In addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide services, products, sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.
> 
> When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.
