**Cookies**  
The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find them at most major Web sites. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user for a particular web site. Later.com sometimes uses cookies to track information, to understand our users better, and for our users' convenience. For example, Later.com can remember your login address using a cookie, so you don't have to re-type it every time you come to the site. 

In addition to cookies stored on the user's hard drive, Later.com also uses session cookies to manage user sessions. These are small bits of data that allow our web server to communicate with a user's browser, and when the user closes the browser the session cookie terminates. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to these cookies. 

**Log Files**  
When you visit Later.com, we automatically recognize your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you are on the Web. We sometimes use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, better administer our Web site, report abusive users, analyze trends, track user's movement and use and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We also track and analyze click-stream data for the same purposes.

We often "co-brand" with other sites, which can mask the link to the alternate site (it still has the look and feel of Later.com). In these cases, we will notify you with a pop-up box that you are leaving our site.
