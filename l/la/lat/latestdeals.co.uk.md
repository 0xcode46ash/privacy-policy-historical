# Privacy Policy | LatestDeals.co.uk

**What information is being collected?**

If you sign up as a member to Latest Deals we will store your e-mail address and chosen username so we can get in touch. If you register via Facebook you'll have an option to choose what information you provide us. By default, Facebook sends us what is referred to as your "public profile" information. This can include your email address, full name, profile picture, gender and age range. Whilst signing up you can choose what information is shared with us and opt out if you would prefer.

We also store your IP address. We do this to help prevent abuse of the Latest Deals community and it's [guidelines](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/guidelines). For example, we may use the IP address to detect retailers who sign up for multiple accounts to try and unscrupulously promote their own services.

 **Who is collecting the data and who is it shared with?**

We (Latest Deals Limited) hold your data and do not share it with any third parties other than set out below:

  * Analytics: Our website uses Google Analytics to analyse how users interact with the site. This is fairly standard practice amongst websites and we assure you nothing untoward is going on! It helps us keep track of the number of visitors to Latest Deals and spot popular deals and trends. You can read more about Google Analytics and the what/how/why at their website, [here](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/go?link=5abd0b70cf4cdd03d960db73). We make every effort not to share any personal identifiable information with Google Analytics.
  * We use a third party service, [MailChimp](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/go?link=592f705cedba831afa13f6aa), to manage our newsletter subscriptions. It is well regarded within the industry and they don't share your e-mail address with anyone other than us. We share your email address and, if you provided it to us, your full name with MailChimp. This allows us to send you emails and to address you by your name.



 **How is the data collected?**

Other than your IP address, we only store information if it is volunteered by you when you sign up to Latest Deals. 

**Why is the data collected?**

We ask for your email address so that we can get in touch with you. As outlined above, your IP address is stored to help prevent the abuse of Latest Deals. Any other information is used to help improve Latest Deals and tailor our content to our visitors.

 **Getting a copy of your personal information**

You're welcome to [contact us](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/contact) if you would like a copy of your personal information that we hold.

 **What if my personal information is incorrect?**

If you believe any of the information that we hold (e.g. your email address) is incorrect you can [contact us](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/contact) to let us know and we'll make sure it's up to date.

 **How can I delete my account and/or personal information?**

We are working on building a system that'll allow you to both download a copy of your personal information and delete your own account. Unfortunately this isn't quite ready so please contact us and we can do this manually as required. 

**Cookies**

We use cookies to save your preferences for viewing Latest Deals e.g. whether you want to view the homepage in a "list" view or "grid" view. We also use cookies for security reasons.

 **Third party websites**

We do not sell anything ourselves at Latest Deals - we are a community that links to deals and offers at various retailers (e.g. Amazon, Tesco or eBay). As these are third party websites not under our control we encourage you to check their privacy policy before providing any personal data. You can tell when you have left Latest Deals as the URL will no longer be [www.latestdeals.co.uk](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/).

 **Sharing deals & commenting**

If you share a deal or comment on our website then you are free - within reason - to say or do what you like. However, to be on the cautious side we would recommend that you avoid sharing any personal information. If you see something on our site that you're not happy about, drop us a line and we'll look into it for you.

 **Contacting us**

If you have any questions about our privacy policy please [contact us](https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/contact) and we'll do our best to help.
