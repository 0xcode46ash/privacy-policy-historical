Resumes  
  
As an employment/career site, LatPro.com, allows you to put your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this:

  1. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by employers/recruiters. This will allow you to respond to a job posting without ever making your resume accessible to employers/recruiters searching our resume database. 
  2. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all employers and recruiters who have registered on our site and been approved by LatPro.com will have access to your resume.



You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, registered employers and recruiters may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database.

If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. If you have any problems changing your password, contact . immediately.
