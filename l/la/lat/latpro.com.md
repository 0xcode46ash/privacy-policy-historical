LatPro.com Privacy Commitment   
  
LatPro.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We seek to provide a safe, secure user experience and ensure that the information you submit to us remains private. 

This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the LatPro User Agreement.  
  
Information About All LatPro.com Visitors  
  
We collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit.  This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and helps us to continually improve your overall experience in using our site. 

We sometimes share aggregate information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to marketing advertisers ever.  
  
Information About You Specifically  
  
All personal information is used solely to provide you with the services you've requested.

When you subscribe to our e-mail mailing list, it is necessary for us to collect your name and e-mail address. This information is never shared with any third parties or used for any other purposes.

When you become a paying site member, we request your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary to process your payment and to notify you of your membership status. Your email and mailing addresses are shared with Latin Trade and Punto-Com magazines if you requested the complimentary subscriptions. 

We use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.

We may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. 

It is possible that LatPro could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that LatPro would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.  
  
External Service Providers  
  
There are a number of services offered by external providers that help you use our Site (e.g. co-branded sites, salary calculators, etc). If you choose to use these optional services, disclose information to the external service providers, and /or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We may, for your convenience, provide some of your personally identifiable information to the external service provider offering such services. However, before we disclose your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you will see what data is about to be sent and have the ability to approve the disclosure. To prevent our disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such disclosures or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practice before deciding to use their services. Users who register on a LatPro co-branded web site (for example Advertica, ZonaFinanciera, and BradyNet) grant LatPro permission to pass you email address back to that co-branded web site and affiliated web sites. The use of such information by the co-brand and affiliated web sites is limited by their applicable privacy policies.  
  
Online Order Security  
  
When you make credit card payments, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.  We employ different security techniques to protect your data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet.  
  
Resumes  
  
As an employment/career site, LatPro.com, allows you to put your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this:

  1. You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by employers/recruiters. This will allow you to respond to a job posting without ever making your resume accessible to employer/recruiters searching our resume database. 
  2. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all employers and recruiters who have registered on our site and been approved by LatPro.com will have access to your resume. 



You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, registered employers and recruiters may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database.  
  
Control of Your Password  
  
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your LatPro password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.  
  
Updating Account Information  
  
LatPro.com allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time. To do so, simply log on to our site and go to My LatPro where you will find options for editing the information you have previously submitted.  
  
Cookies  
  
To enhance your experience at  LatPro.com we use a feature on your Internet browser called a "cookie". Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies for remembering user names and passwords and preferences, tracking click streams, and for load balancing. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site experience. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, doing this will prevent you from using our site effectively.  
  
A special note about Children   
  
We ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information.  
  
Legal Requests   
  
LatPro cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your User ID, name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name as we in our sole discretion believe necessary.  
  
Summary   
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use your personal information only for providing you with the services you've requested. We never sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.  Never.
