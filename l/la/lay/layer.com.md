## What information does Layer collect?

Layer collects some “personally identifiable information,” which, by definition, is any information that can be used to identify a person. When you use Layer.com we automatically receive and record your IP address and cookie information and, should you choose to provide it, collect your first and last name and email address.

Despite Layer’s access to this data, it remains yours. At no time does it become the property of Layer. 

## How does Layer use your information?

In short, your personally identifiable information is used only for the explicit purpose communicated to you at the time you shared it. Additionally, your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you about product or company information and technical updates. Should you no longer wish to have your personally identifiable used in this manner, simply opt out using the link provided in any Layer communication.

Layer does not, under any circumstances, share your data with third-party organizations.

This privacy policy reflects how we, as developers ourselves, would like our own data to be treated by service providers. If at any time you feel Layer is in violation of this privacy policy, please contact us at [contact@layer.com](mailto:contact@layer.com)
