However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
    * We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing LA.com to collect and use their child's information without consenting to LA.com sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes;

    * We transfer information about you if LA.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, LA.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * LA.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
    * LA.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
