# LA.com Privacy Policy

  
**LA.com Privacy Policy**  
LA.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. The following statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the LA.com web site. This policy does not apply to other web sites, or to companies and persons that are not controlled or managed by LA.com.

**What personally identifiable information does LA.com collect from me?**  
LA.com collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered through server log files, cookies and page requests. Personal information is also gathered when you enter a contest or promotion, or subscribe to a LA.com newsletter. During these instances, LA.com may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, and phone number. We may also ask you for other information at other times.

**How is my information used?**  
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a customized experience. LA.com uses information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our Web site, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics. LA.com may share this aggregate data with advertisers or business partners. The aggregate information is not linked to your personally identifiable information.

LA.com also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web service and stored on your computer's hard drive. LA.com uses cookies to deliver targeted advertising based on your behavior or demographics and to track your number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do we will not be able to customize the LA.com Web site's features according to your preferences. Some of our business partners, for example advertisers, may use cookies and other software technologies, such as clear gifs or web beacons, on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies or technologies once we have given permission to our business partners to use them on our site. Other companies' use of cookies and other software technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this policy.

**With whom is my information shared?**  
When you are on an area of LA.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with LA.com and its related companies. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any other company, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. You will be asked to "OPT IN" if you elect to share your personal information with our business partners in order to receive email newsletters or promotional messages from the those business partners.

Promotions and contests that run on LA.com may be sponsored by companies other than LA.com or may be co-sponsored by LA.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion or contest may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion or contest if you don't want your data to be shared.

LA.com may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to our users. Some of these forums require registration. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

While LA.com makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose personal information when required by law or we have a reasonable belief that such action is necessary to comply with court orders, subpoenas or legal process. We may disclose or share personal information if it is reasonably necessary for LA.com to protect its legal rights or defend legal claims, or if we reasonably believe that disclosure or sharing or such personal information is necessary in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or breach of our terms of service.

**Linked Sites**  
Please be aware that LA.com's promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet sites, and content providers accessible through LA.com may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
