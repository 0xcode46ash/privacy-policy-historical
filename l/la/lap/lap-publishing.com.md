## Revoking the Contract

The contract can be revoked in written form (e.g. letter, fax or e-mail) within 14 days without giving explanation or – if the item has been delivered before deadline – by returning the item. The revocation term starts with receiving this instruction in written form, however not before the delivery of the item to the recipient (not before returning the same items and not before receiving the first part of the items) and not before the fulfillment of our mandatory obligations according to article 246, paragraph 2 in junction with paragraph 1, section 1 and 2 of the preamble of German Civil Code, as well as our obligations according to paragraph 312g, section 1, sentence 1 of the German Civil Code in junction with Article 246 paragraph 3 of the preamble of the German Civil Code. In order to retain the terms of revoking the contract, the contract’s revocation or the received item(s) must be sent or returned in due time. The revocation should be sent to:

LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing GmbH & Co. KG, Heinrich-Böcking-Straße 6-8, 66121 Saarbrücken, Germany, Fax: +49 681 3720-3109, E-Mail: info[at]lap-publishing.com.

## Effects of revocation

In the event of an effective revocation, the mutual services received must be returned and the potential benefits (e.g. interest) must be re-compensated. If you do not return the value of services (for example the prerogative of usage), return it only partially or return it in a worsened state, you must compensate the value of the item or the service. You must compensate the value of damaged articles, used services and gains only if the use and damages have occurred as a result of the usage of the item that exceeds the examination of the properties and functions. The “examination of the properties and functions” refers to the testing and evaluation of the respective item in person as it would be possible and common in a store. Items sent as packages are to be sent back at our own risk. You must pay the cost of returning the item if the item received is the same as the item ordered and if the price of the item to be returned does not exceed EUR 40 or if – in the case of a higher price – at the time the revocation is declared, you have not paid for the item or made a partial payment as agreed in the contract. Otherwise, the returning of the item is free of charge. If the article cannot be sent as a package, it will be collected from your location. If the item is damaged, it must be replaced or reimbursed within 30 days. Your deadline period begins when you send the revocation or return the item, and ours begins when we receive it.
