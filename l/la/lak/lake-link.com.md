# Lake-Link.com Online Privacy Policy

|  |    
Lake-Link.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Set forth below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to Lake-Link.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to our domestic web site and not to sites that may be linked to ours. You should refer to those sites' own privacy policies to learn how they collect and use information about you. Information submitted solely in a business capacity is not covered by this policy.   
  
Information We Collect

  1. Browser Information: When you visit the Site, we use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet. 
  2. Information You Submit: In a few areas on the Site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your Site visit or to follow up with you after your visit. It is completely optional for you to participate. For example, we request information from you when you: 
    * Register on the Site. 
    * Provide feedback in an online survey 
    * Participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotional offer. 
    * Subscribe to a newsletter or mailing list. 
    * Send us an e-mail. 
    * Participate in a chat room or post a message to a message board. 
In each of these instances, we may ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address and similar personal information that is needed to provide you with services or information. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. 

How We Use Your Information

  1. Your Browser Information: We use the information we collect with cookies to recognize you when you return to the Site. This means that you only have to enter your password in order to log in. We also use the information to improve the design of the Site. We do not share this information with any third party. 
  2. Your Personal Information: We use your personal information for internal marketing efforts - for example, to help us improve the Site design and better understand the demographic makeup of our visitors. We may occasionally seek your permission to merge the information we collect from you with information that we receive from other sources. We will not use your information in this way unless we have received your prior agreement to do so. We may use your personal information to alert you to special offers, updated information and other new services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time, you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from us by sending an e-mail with your request to remove@Lake-Link.com. We will not give or sell your personal information to any third party without your consent. This means that you will be able to opt-in your agreement to such use when you submit your personal information. At any time, you can easily opt-out of having your personal information shared any further with third parties by sending an e-mail with your request to remove@Lake-Link.com.
