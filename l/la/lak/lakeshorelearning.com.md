What personal information about customers does Lakeshore gather?  
During the registration process, we store your name, e-mail address, and zip code. During the ordering process, we obtain information such as your mailing address, billing address, phone number, and school.

Our web server will automatically collect standard anonymous information (like web log data and IP addresses). This information, which is never shared outside of Lakeshore, helps us spot trends, improve our products and product design, and improve the functionality of our website.

Like all retail websites, we use cookies to store your preferences and to help us remember you as a user when you make return visits to the website. We also use cookies to record session information, such as items saved to your shopping cart(s), the different web pages you view on our website, and the last website you visited prior to visiting ours.

Lakeshore does not—and will never—sell, rent, or loan customer information to any third party.

How can I change my personal information?  
At any time, you can review and modify the information you gave us during the registration process. Just go to [your account](https://web.archive.org/member_info/signinRegister.jsp) page. There, you have the option of looking over the information that you gave us, and to change or update that information if desired.

How will I be notified if your Privacy Policy changes?  
We may amend our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes in the way we collect or use your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website.

Privacy Policy effective: December 7, 2010

Security  
Shopping online with Lakeshore and Toys to Grow On is a completely safe experience!

We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)—the industry standard in online encryption technology—to ensure that your personal and credit card information remains secure. SSL encryption allows you to shop with confidence, knowing that only you and Lakeshore have the ability to access your information.

Keeping customer information private has always been a top priority at Lakeshore; that’s why we will not sell, rent, or loan customer information to any third party.

Whenever you access a secure page on our site, the information you send is immediately encrypted for your protection. There are two simple ways to see if you are on a secure page:

• Look at the URL (website address) in your browser. If you are connected to a secure server, the URL will always begin with “https” rather than “http.”  
• Most browsers display an icon that indicates whether or not you have a secure connection.
