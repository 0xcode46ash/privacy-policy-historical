privacy & security

| 

Here at Lakeshore, we realize that you are concerned about protecting your online privacy. When you shop with us, you can rest assured that your privacy will be respected. We share your concerns. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. Our Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding online privacy and security.

What personal information about customers does Lakeshore gather?  
Lakeshore does not require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy any of our websites. That means you can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for users who do register. During the registration process, we store your name, e-mail address and zip code. During the ordering process, we obtain information such as your mailing address, billing address, phone number and school.

From time to time we may share a customer’s name, e-mail address and mailing address with carefully selected companies whose offers customers may be interested in. We also occasionally obtain names, e-mail addresses and mailing addresses from these companies. Customers’ phone numbers are not shared with outside companies.

Our web server will automatically collect standard anonymous information (such as web log data and IP addresses). This information, which is never shared outside of Lakeshore, helps us spot trends, improve our products and product design, and improve the functionality of our website.

Like all retail websites, we use cookies to store your preferences and to help us remember you as a user when you make return visits to the website. We also use cookies to record session information such as items saved to your shopping cart(s), the different web pages you view on our website, and the last website you visited prior to visiting ours.

How can I change my personal information?  
At any time, you can review and modify the information you gave us during the registration process. Just go to your account page. There, you have the option of looking over the information that you gave us and changing or updating that information if desired. We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies if you contact us at [lakeshore@lakeshorelearning.com](mailto:lakeshore@lakeshorelearning.com) or call us at (800) 428-4414.

How will I be notified if your Privacy Policy changes?  
We may amend our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes in the way we collect or use your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address you provided us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website.

Privacy Policy effective: April 24, 2014.

Security  
Shopping online with Lakeshore is a completely safe experience!

We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)—the industry standard in online encryption technology—to ensure that your personal and credit card information remains secure. SSL encryption allows you to shop with confidence, knowing that only you and Lakeshore have the ability to access your information.

Whenever you access a secure page on our site, the information you send is immediately encrypted for your protection. There are two simple ways to see if you are on a secure page:

• Look at the URL (website address) in your browser. If you are connected to a secure server, the URL will always begin with “https” rather than “http.”  
• Most browsers display an icon that indicates whether or not you have a secure connection.

Should you ever prefer to place your order by phone, just call us toll free at (800) 778-4456, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday-Friday, and Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., PST. Simply tell us the item names and numbers of any products you’d like to purchase, and we’ll be glad to take your order!

If you’d prefer to order by mail, call our toll-free number to get a free catalog, or click on [free catalog](https://www.lakeshorelearning.com/general_content/catalog/catalog_request.jsp).
