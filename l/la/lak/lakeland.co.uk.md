# Privacy Policy

**You can always trust Lakeland**. We completely understand that your personal information is private to you so we always treat it with the highest standards of security and confidentiality. Rest assured, we will never sell or give your information to any other company for them to use for their own purposes, such as marketing.

## What information do we collect about you?

When you sign up for our email newsletters, ask us for a catalogue, place an order for one of our products or sign up for an account, we collect information about you. This information ensures we can manage your orders, communicate with you and helps us improve and develop our services. We also automatically collect information about you when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback and participate in our prize draws and competitions. We may collect information on your website usage using 'cookies' from whichever device you use. Click _[here](https://web.archive.org/CookiesPolicy.action)_ to view our full Cookies policy.

## How do we use the information about you?

Your information allows us to process any orders you place with us, update you on the progress of your order and assist with any future customer service queries. Everything you buy from Lakeland comes with a 3 year guarantee so we will normally keep your details on file for at least 3 years – that way, they will be easy to find if necessary.

We do employ the services of other companies to support our business for specific functions; for example, fulfilling and dispatching orders, sending marketing materials via the post and by email, validating and analysing our customer data and processing credit card payments. For certain purchases, we may also need to verify your identity for fraud prevention and age verification. All Third Party Service Providers we work with are vetted carefully and highly trusted by us, and they comply fully with our Privacy Promise and applicable data protection laws. They only use your information to perform the services that we have employed them to do. 

## How will we keep in touch with you?

With your permission, we would love to keep you up to date with our latest news, products and offers by contacting you via the post, by email and other internet-based digital communications, including social media, and using any similar services or applications as they become available. In order to make sure that what we send you will be useful and interesting, we'd like to use your information to help us decide what we talk to you about. We'll do this by looking at what you've bought before and how you interact with us. Ultimately, we want your shopping experience with us to be extraordinary so this information will really help us achieve just that. 

We hope you'll find hearing from us valuable but should you change your mind, you can easily opt out of receiving these communications – simply give us a call, chat with us online, email or write to us (click _[here](https://web.archive.org/help/contact-us)_ for details). Alternatively, you can update the settings in your _[online account](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/LoginRegistration.action)_ if you have set one up or click on the unsubscribe link that appears in every one of our email newsletters.
