Our goal is to provide you with an experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we may collect information from you. We discuss our information collection practices below. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles we follow, in accordance with our operations.

##### What Information Is Collected and How is it Used?

A. What Information Do We Collect?

  1. **Personal Information:** information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  2. **Non-Personal Information:** any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include IP addresses and web server log files to track trends, administer the Websites, track user movement, and gather demographic information, and information collected through cookies.



It is not our regular practice to collect “Sensitive Information,” such as Personal Information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual. If we collect Sensitive Information from you, we commit that we will not disclose it to any third parties, including our affiliates or Contractors, or use that information for purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which it originally was collected (as permitted by this policy) unless you expressly tell us that we can disclose that information or use it for those different purposes. In order for us to disclose it or use it for those purposes, you must contact us to inform us that you do will permit these uses of your Sensitive Information. To do so, please contact us by mail or email at the address or email address provided above.

B. How Do We Collect the Information?

We will only collect and use Personal Information when a user voluntarily provides it to us or when an institution provides it to us in connection with its method of authenticating users for access to our products.

Such disclosure is strictly voluntary. In order to contact us by e-mail, however, you must provide an e-mail address.

We collect and use non-Personal Information, including IP addresses and web server log files to track trends, administer the Websites, track user movement, and gather demographic information. We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information. We may also share aggregated demographic information with our business partners, sponsors, advertisers, and companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Grand View Media.
