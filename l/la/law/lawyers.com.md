Mar. 31--They come as envelope stuffers in your bank statement, your credit-card or insurance bill -- those privacy notices that companies must send to customers each year.

Most consumers throw them away without reading them. But because personal privacy is so highly valued, you should read them to know how companies use your personal information and how you can prevent its widespread release.

"They do provide some value in that they will notify you of certain rights that you have to opt out of information sharing," said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego. "Unfortunately, the law is riddled with a lot of exceptions." 

Federal law gives you the right to protect your personal financial information from being released or sold by banks and other financial services companies you do business with.

You do this by "opting out" -- which means that your bank, credit-card company, insurance company or brokerage firm is free to sell your customer data to or share it with other companies unless you specifically tell them not to.

The law requires companies to send privacy notices to customers once a year telling them how the company collects and uses their information and how they can limit the use and disclosure of that data.

"Privacy notices are not privacy rights," said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. "The notices tell you basically that the bank can do whatever it wants with your information, even if you don't want it to.

"You have a limited right to opt out of their sharing with third-party telemarketers, but the law gives financial firms the right to share your information with their affiliates and many other third-party companies they do business with, regardless of your choice," he added.

"If the bank offers any opt-outs, it is in your interest to take them, but understand that it won't stop most sharing."

Bankers say consumers do have power.

"You're able to opt out," said John Hall, spokesman for the American Bankers Association. "It puts the consumer in the driver's seat."

Consumer and privacy advocates said the best privacy policies are ones that allow you to "opt in," which prohibits a financial institution from sharing or selling your data if you don't give your affirmative consent.

Under current law, it's important that you respond to the privacy notice if you don't want your information shared. Otherwise, you're giving your implied consent for the financial institution to share your data.

"If you say nothing, it means, 'Yes, you can share my data,' " the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse said. "The default for the opt-out approach is that your data is shared until and unless you notify the company otherwise."

You must respond using the exact method that the company provides you, be it online or through a toll-free number.

"If you utilize another method for opting out, they may not honor that request," Mr. Stephens said.

Opting out allows you to prevent a company from sharing "personally identifiable financial information" with nonaffiliated third parties -- companies, individuals and organizations that aren't affiliated with the firm you're doing business with.

That information includes your Social Security number, bank account numbers and credit-card numbers.

But the law has many exceptions:

\-- You can't prevent a company from sharing information about you with a company owned or controlled by the same people or parent company as the one sending the privacy notice to you.

However, under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, you can opt out of having information about your creditworthiness shared with company affiliates.

\-- You can't opt out of the sale or sharing of your customer data with joint marketers. Those are third parties that have contracted with the company you do business with to sell you products.

An example would be if your credit-card company enters into an agreement with another company to sell you insurance against loss on your credit-card account.

\-- You can't prevent a company from sharing "publicly available information," such as your telephone number, unless you have an unlisted number.

\-- You can't prevent a company from sharing with its affiliates transactional information that may include such things as the charges you make on your credit card or the checks you write. However, you can opt-out of the sharing or sale of this information to a nonaffiliated third party.

"What you want to look at," Mr. Stephens said, "is, do they disclose nonpublic personal information, do they disclose it to affiliates and do they disclose it to third-party nonaffiliates?"

The answers to those questions are critical to protecting your privacy and identity. The more sources that have your information, the greater the chance that one of them could experience a breach of that sensitive data.
