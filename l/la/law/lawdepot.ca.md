### Our Commitment to your Privacy

LawDepot™ is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your visit to our website is completely secure.

If you have any questions or problems with any aspect of our privacy policy, please [contact us](http://www.lawdepot.ca/help/).

### Security of your Personal Information

To maintain the security of your information, we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol with 128-bit encryption strength to transmit sensitive information. This is the same technology used in transmitting sensitive information by banks, governments, and online businesses such as Amazon.com and eBay.

Once the information is in our system, it is accessible to authorized LawDepot™ personnel only. We strictly enforce our privacy policies with our employees and any breach of this policy will result in termination and the pressing of criminal charges where there are grounds.

### How we use your Personal Information

Your personal information will be used in order to provide you with the requested products and services. This includes the use of information for completing transactions or communicating back to you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not used for any other purpose.

We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our Site's users in general (such as we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed). 

### Who we share your Personal Information with

We will NOT sell or rent your name or personal information to anyone else. We DO NOT sell, rent or provide outside access to our mailing list at all.

LawDepot™ will not release your personal information to authorities unless required by law, search warrant, court order, subpoena, or fraud investigation.

LawDepot™ will share your information with third parties only to the extent necessary to provide the services and products requested by you. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. 

### Collection of your Personal Information

LawDepot™ only saves such personal information that is necessary for you to access and use our services. This personal information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, email address, phone number, other payment processing information and document creation data. Upon request, we will delete your personal information.

### Document Preparation and Privacy of Information

The information you provide when you prepare a document on our website is held strictly confidential. For your protection provide a valid email address that will not block email from LawDepot™.
