**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

From time to time, ALM may use customer information for new purposes not previously disclosed in this privacy notice.

###  WHAT INFORMATION DOES ALM GATHER AND/OR TRACK ABOUT YOU?

**Personal Information**

_Free E-Mails_ : When you sign-up to receive free ALM e-mail information bulletins, ALM requires that you supply your name and e-mail address.  
_Registration for ALM Products_ : When you register to receive ALM products, including products from CLECenter.com, whether those products are free or paid, ALM requires that you supply your full name, e-mail address, contact information, and a unique subscriber ID.

Customers must also agree to the Terms of Use applicable to the product for which they are registering and the ALM User License Agreement. In some instances, ALM also collects credit card information to bill subscribers for premium products.

_Credit Card Information_ : If you use a credit card to pay for an ALM product or CLE program, ALM may retain your credit card information in order to renew your account in the event you elect to renew your subscription. When ALM does retain credit card information, ALM keeps it secure and separate from other demographic information you may have provided. ALM does not share credit card information internally within divisions of ALM.

  * Your Basic Profile (including first name, last name, headline)
  * Your full profile (including experience, education and skills)
  * Your contact information
  * Your e-mail address



ALM will only collect the Profile Data on a one-time basis, unless or until the Profile Data is updated by you (which updated Profile Date you hereby give ALM permission to subsequently collect). ALM will not sell to any third parties the Profile Data. At any time, you may request that ALM remove the Profile Data from its system by contacting Customer Service.

**Other Non-Personal Information Collected Using Technology**

ALM may also gather other non-personal information, which is any information that does not reveal your specific identity (i.e., browser information, information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information and aggregated information) and may be used by ALM or shared with third parties. This information does not personally identify you but may be helpful for improving the services ALM offers.

_Cookies_ : “Cookies” give users a special, random ID which are small text files, which are stored on the hard drive of a user’s computer or device. ALM employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Website as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Website cannot access many areas of the Website. ALM also uses advertising servers developed by third parties (currently Real Media 24/7, Google, and BBN to name a few) to display ads on the Website; however ALM reserves the right to work with other third party advertising networks on an as-needed basis. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (i.e., advertising agencies or advertising technology providers). ALM does not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with ALM’s services. However, it’s important to remember that many of ALM’S services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, ALM needs first-party cookies to log you in to read stories that require registration or a subscription. In that case, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow ALM’s first-party cookies only.

_Device Information_ : ALM may collect non-personal information about the device (e.g. computer, mobile, e-reader, tablet) you use to access ALM’s services, including but not limited to IP addresses, geo-location information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information. If you access our Online Services from a device, ALM may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.

_IP Addresses_ : ALM also logs IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. (Your IP address indicates the location of your computer on the Internet.) ALM neither logs IP addresses to track your session nor links IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. ALM uses this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to ALM Online Services.

_Analytics Technologies_ : ALM has hired third parties to provide ALM information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of users of ALM products and services. Such third parties shall (i) track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information about ALM visitors and customers with respect to ALM Online Services; and (ii) track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of users of ALM’s Online Services.

_User History_ : ALM may log certain usage information about your use of ALM products, which may include a history of the pages you view. This information will help ALM to provide you with customized products or services. ALM may also use log files in the aggregate to analyze usage of ALM’s websites and mobile applications. If you download and use any ALM software application (either on a tablet or other mobile device), the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to ALM’s servers when your device syncs up for the latest content available.

_Location_ : Certain ALM mobile applications may deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of such application. If you choose to enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which the application will use. If you do not enable the location-based feature or if an application does not have that feature, the application will not transmit to ALM, and ALM shall not collect or store, location information.

_“Do Not Track” Signals_ : At this time, ALM does not respond to browser “do not track” signals or other, similar, mechanisms.

_California’s Online Privacy Protection Act_ : Except as otherwise disclosed in this Policy, third parties may not gather your personally identifiable information over time and/or across different websites when you use ALM’s Online Services.
