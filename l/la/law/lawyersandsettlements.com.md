OLM asks for your contact information and particulars of your case when you submit a complaint. 

OLM may also collect IP addresses to help understand how our audience uses our site and to gather broader demographic information, so that OLM can make its site better and improve users' overall experience when they visit _LawyersandSettlements.com_. For these same reasons, if your browser is set up to accept them, OLM uses a feature known as a "cookie." Cookies contain bits of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as _LawyersandSettlements.com_. A cookie doesn't tell OLM who you are.

**How OLM Discloses Your Personal Information**  
OLM will only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of OLM.

OLM discloses personally identifiable individual information and the other information you provide us to lawyers or law firms who declare that they are interested in considering whether your complaint could form the basis of a lawsuit. OLM cannot guarantee that the information you submit to us will not end up in the hands of the company or person that you are complaining about.

OLM may also disclose your contact information and the other information that you provide us in the following circumstances:

  1. OLM may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.
  2. OLM might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate via bankruptcy this business. If so, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  3. OLM may release account and other personal information when OLM believes release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OLM, our users, or others. 



From time to time OLM may also provide aggregate (statistical) information to third parties to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. If OLM partners with another party to provide a specific service to you, and if you sign up for the service, then and only then will OLM provide your other information to such partner.
