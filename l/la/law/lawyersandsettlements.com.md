**How OLM Discloses Your Personal Information**

OLM cannot guarantee that the information you submit to us will not end up in the hands of third parties, including, without limitation, the company or person against whom you may have a complaint.

OLM may also disclose your contact information and the other information that you provide us in the following circumstances:

  1. OLM may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.
  2. OLM might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate via bankruptcy this business. If so, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  3. OLM may release account and other personal information when OLM believes release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OLM, our users, or others. 



From time to time OLM may also provide aggregate (statistical) information to third parties to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. If OLM partners with another party to provide a specific service to you, and if you sign up for the service, then and only then will OLM provide your other information to such partner.
