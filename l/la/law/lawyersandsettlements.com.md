# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what Online Legal Services Ltd. ("OLS") does with the personal information that is collected from our users. OLS may change its policy from time to time, so it is suggested that you check this web site from time to time to ensure that you know about current policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact _LawyersandSettlements.com_ 's privacy officer via our [Contact Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20041208130617id_/http%3A//lawyersandsettlements.com/contact.html).

**What We Collect**  
OLS asks for your contact information and particulars of your case when you submit a complaint. 

OLS may also collect IP addresses to help understand how our audience uses our site and to gather broader demographic information, so that OLS can make its site better and improve users' overall experience when they visit _LawyersandSettlements.com_. For these same reasons, if your browser is set up to accept them, OLS uses a feature known as a "cookie." Cookies contain bits of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as _LawyersandSettlements.com_. A cookie doesn't tell OLS who you are. Only you can do that.

**Children**  
If you are under 18, you may not use this site.

**How OLS Discloses Your Personal Information**  
OLS will only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of OLS.

OLS discloses personally identifiable individual information and the other information you provide us to lawyers or law firms who declare that they are interested in considering whether your complaint could form the basis of a lawsuit. OLS cannot guarantee that the information you submit to us will not end up in the hands of the company or person that you are complaining about.

OLS may also disclose your contact information and the other information that you provide us in the following circumstances:

  1. OLS may permit third parties to offer you services or goods if OLS thinks that you will benefit from the offer. You will be able to tell when another business is involved in your transactions. OLS will share your contact information only with such third parties.
  2. OLS may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.
  3. OLS might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate via bankruptcy this business. If so, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  4. OLS may release account and other personal information when OLS believes release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OLS, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

From time to time OLS may also provide aggregate (statistical) information to third parties to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. If OLS partners with another party to provide a specific service to you, and if you sign up for the service, then and only then will OLS provide your other information to such partner.

If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can click the unsubscribe link, which you will find on our email messages or send an email at any time via our [Contact](https://web.archive.org/web/20041208130617id_/http%3A//lawyersandsettlements.com/contact.html) page.
