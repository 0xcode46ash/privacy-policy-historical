# Our Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy **

**Our Commitment to Privac** **y**

LawDepot™ believes in your right to privacy. As a result, LawDepot™ has very strict privacy policies and we endeavor to keep secure any information you provide us (such as your personal and financial information).  


This Privacy Policy covers LawDepot™ treatment of your personally identifiable information that it collects when you are on its site, and when you use its services. We will hold all information you provide to us in complete privacy.   


We will not sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party. We DO NOT sell, rent or provide outside access to our mailing list.   


Only authorized employees of LawDepot™ may access any of your information. We strictly enforce our privacy policies with our employees and breaches of this policy will result in termination and the pressing of criminal charges where there are grounds.

LawDepot™ only collects such personal information that is necessary for you to access and use our services. This personal information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, physical address, zip code, email address, phone number, social security number, birth date, credit card information, financial information, loan information, vehicle information, marital information, and other personal information necessary to generate proper legal documents. 

If LawDepot™ is required by law, search warrant, subpoena or court order, LawDepot™ may be required to release such personal information. 

We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our site's users in general (such as we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed). 

LawDepot™ currently retains personally identifiable information for a period of seven years. The reason for this lies in the fact that often users will request their legal documents for revision and update purposes. If at anytime you wish to delete all of your personally identifiable information from our site, you may contact us at [contact@LawDepot™.com](mailto:contact@legalcontracts.com?subject=Deletion%20of%20Personal%20Information) or you may reach us at 1-866-608-1020 (toll-free). 

**Data Encryption and Security**

We attempt to ensure our servers and connections incorporate the latest encryption and security devices. We have also implemented various procedures that will help prevent unauthorized access. 

IF FOR ANY REASON YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR PRIVACY HAS BEEN BREACHED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR SITE, YOU MAY CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY AT 1-866-608-1020 (toll-free) or [contact@LawDepot™.com](mailto:contact@legalcontracts.com?subject=Privacy%20concern).
