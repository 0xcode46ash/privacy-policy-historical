Who we share your information with

We do not disclose any PII except in the following circumstances: 

• Accommodation and airline suppliers:  We provide the guest/passenger name, telephone number and email address for each booking made to the relevant supplier or its representatives to fulfil your booking.  For flights bookings we may also provide to the airline other relevant information collected from you.  Our suppliers require this information for the booking and may use it if they need to contact you about the booking.  Although we offer accommodation and flights from reputable suppliers, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any supplier whose services you book on our website. 

• Third party service providers:  We may share your PII with third parties we appoint to perform services on our behalf.  For example, we use a technology platform provider to facilitate marketing campaigns controlled and managed by us.  Our service providers are not permitted to use or share your PII for any purpose other than the purpose for which they are appointed. 

• Legal obligations:  We may be required by law to disclose your PII or to service providers where we are investigating a serious complaint or potential illegal acts.

Other than as set out above you will be notified when PII about you will be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity not to have us share such information.  
 

**Disclosure of your information overseas**

Your PII may be transferred to, stored and processed overseas where those third parties with whom we share it, as described in this policy, are located.  Due to the nature of the travel services offered to you many of the service providers that we deal with are located overseas.  For example, if you have made a booking for a flight provided by an overseas travel provider we will need to disclose your PII to them to confirm that booking.  As a consequence, it is not practicable to list the location of every service provider with whom we deal.  We do, however, engage a third party technology platform provider based in the United States to facilitate our marketing campaigns controlled and managed by us.  
 

The recipient of your PII may be located in a country that might not provide an equivalent level of data protection.  While we do take steps to help ensure that your PII is protected we cannot be accountable for how these recipients handle your PII.  By using this website and providing your PII to us, you consent to your PII being transferred to these overseas recipients.  If you have any concerns regarding the transfer of your PII overseas please contact us using the details provided below.
