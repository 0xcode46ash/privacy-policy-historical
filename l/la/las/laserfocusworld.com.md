PennWell has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other United States governmental agencies.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privacyshield.gov%2F&data=02%7C01%7CDWarren%40Pennwell.com%7C1eeb3cb085e74982c40e08d4f6c8ee3a%7C5bbf75da8a3f493c8343e6cd0cb0e070%7C0%7C0%7C636404790247847523&sdata=dsDOQV%2FCXxS%2FvlBL%2FsO7pUZQouDm3YuPdTUAl6fiy58%3D&reserved=0).

### Accountability For Onward Transfer

We endeavor to enter into contracts with third-party data controllers, which provide (i) that data subject to the Privacy Shield may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the individual; and (ii) that the recipient will provide the same level of protection as the Principles and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation and that if such a determination is made, the third-party controller will cease processing or will take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.

We transfer personal data to a third party acting as an agent under the following conditions: (i) for limited and specified purposes; (ii) we ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles; (iv) we require the agent to notify the us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) we will, upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) we will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of our contract with that agent to the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “ **Department** “) upon request. We remain potentially liable if an agent that we engage to assist us does so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.

We commit to cooperate with EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, as well as non-human resources data transferred from the EU. Specifically, we commit to cooperate with the DPAs, including but not limited to cooperating with the DPAs in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Privacy Shield and complying with any advice given by the DPAs where the DPAs take the view that we need to take specific action to comply with the Principles, including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non-compliance with the Principles, and we further agree to provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken.

As part of the Privacy Shield self-certification, the DMA acts as PennWell’s dispute resolution mediator.  We have selected the DMA, as the independent dispute resolution body (the “Arbiter“) designated to address your complaints and provide appropriate recourse to you free of charge.  The DMA is an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must first, prior to initiating an arbitration claim, raise the claimed violation directly with us and afford us an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in the Principles. If you have exhausted all other means to resolve your concern regarding a potential violation of our obligations under the Principles, you may invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel. For additional information about the arbitration process please visit the Privacy Shield website at [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/);
