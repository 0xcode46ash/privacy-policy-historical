## Use of Information

We collect data from customers when they register and make a purchase online. We also gather data about our customers from their use of the Website. We use this data to corroborate our customers' identity, process your registration, order and payments, manage orders including delivery, communicate with customers about orders, products, services and promotions, manage customer accounts, provide warranty support, enable management of this Website, display personalised content such as wish lists and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest. We also use this data to further develop this Website to be of use to customers and to manage security.

We will not trade or sell your personal details. In order to process your order, deliver the goods to you and provide warranty support, we will provide your details to our third party business partners (but only for these purposes). These will be reputable companies under our control, which we have carefully screened. Other than that, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by law, a court order or other legal requirement. In processing your order, the information that you have provided will be subject to credit and fraud prevention checks. For these purposes, we may transfer your information to third parties and/or countries outside the European Economic Area.

We do send regular e-mails about our special offers. Should you wish to stop receiving these, there is a simple unsubscribe link in every e-mail. Even if you have consented to receiving other promotional information from us, you can request that we do not contact you with further information by e-mailing us at [customerservices@laskys.com](mailto:customerservices@laskys.com "Send us an email").

When you view this Website by linking from another web page, we may store the name of that web page for the purposes of internal administration and analysis. We may share non-personal, anonymous, aggregate statistics (group) data about visitors to this Website, use and other traffic patterns with connected or third parties.

By using this Website you agree that any successor operator of the Laskys business may use your personal information on the same basis as we do.

In addition to the protections above, your personal data is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998. Under this Act we will only process any data we hold about you in a lawful and fair manner. We will keep your data as safe and secure as reasonably possible protecting it against loss and unauthorised disclosure or access. We only hold your personal information for the reasons given above and we will only hold it for as long as is necessary for those purposes.

## Links to other Websites

We may, from time to time, refer to or establish relationships with other businesses or organisations that will enable you to access their Websites directly from our Website. Each of these third party Websites operates its own policy regarding privacy, the use and sale of personal data and the use of cookies. If you have a particular concern or interest in the way your data will be used, then you are advised to read the Privacy Statement on the relevant Website.

We will always try to provide you with links to high quality, reputable Websites that we believe will be of interest and relevant to you but please note, such third party Websites are not under our control and we do not contribute to their content. When you click through to any of these Websites, you leave the area we control and accordingly, we cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with the third party's use of your data, their Website content or the services offered to you by those Websites.
