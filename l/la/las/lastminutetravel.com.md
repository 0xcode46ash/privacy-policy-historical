This contact information is used to provide you with e-mail notifications of important information regarding the services provided by this Site and time sensitive, third party offers based upon criteria specified by you.

Session cookies are used to enable you to 1) log onto this Site as a My Travel Minder user or Travel Provider, and 2) use all permitted pages of this Site without repeatedly logging on at every page.

Persistent long-term cookies are only set on your computer, if you choose the "Remember who I am and log me in automatically next time" option when you log in. You can choose to not exercise this option, in which case you will have to log in manually the next time you visit the Site. You must decline this option when using a computer other than your usual computer. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but usually allow you to change their setting to prevent that.
