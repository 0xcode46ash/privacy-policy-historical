# Privacy & Cookies

## Privacy

Your privacy and security is important to us. We aim to ensure that any personal information you provide will always be held, used and transmitted in compliance with UK data protection laws.

By using our website and/or registering with lasenza.co.uk, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described on this page.

### Personal Data

When you make a purchase from our website, we collect certain personal information from you, such as:

  * your contact information (name, address, telephone number, email address etc);
  * your purchase information (credit/debit card details); and
  * other personal information (such as your size if you are buying something from us)



**(“Personal Data”)**

We hold all such Personal Data on secure servers and treat it as fully confidential.

We will not sell your Personal Data to third parties. We do, however, share customer information with the following third parties:

  * our group companies;
  * banks, credit card companies and carriers as is necessary to process your order;
  * credit reference agencies, in the interests of fraud detection and prevention and credit risk reduction;
  * couriers or other agents for the purposes of processing or arrange delivery of your order;
  * third party databases to which La Senza subscribes;
  * government bodies or other authorities if necessary to comply with regulations or law or to assist with law enforcement, or to protect our property and other rights;
  * agencies who help us collate statistics about site traffic, sales, demographics and other commercial information to enable us to tailor the services we provide to you and other customers.



Some of these third parties may be located in countries that are outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your Personal Data may also be processed by employees operating outside the EEA who work for us, third party data processors or for our suppliers. Such employees may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Countries which are outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom but we will make sure that we have the necessary contracts and other mechanisms in place to ensure your Personal Data continues to be treated in accordance with the provisions of the UK data protection laws. By submitting your Personal Data through our website, you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of such data outside of the EEA.

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as it is legally required, and to support the business purposes for which it was obtained - we will then dispose of it promptly and securely.

### Payment security

We take the security of your payment and personal details very seriously. Our website uses standard SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption technology, to protect your Personal Data. We have also introduced Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™ to enhance your existing card account against unauthorised use when you shop with us.   
Despite taking all of these measures to safeguard your Personal Data, no transmission over the internet can ever be guaranteed 100% secure. We recommend that you take the following measures to enhance your online safety:

  * if you are using a computer or terminal in a public location, always log out and close the website browser when you complete an online session;
  * keep your account passwords strictly private;
  * when creating a password, use at least 8 characters (a combination of letters and numbers is best - do not use your name, email address, or other personal information that can be easily obtained)
  * change your password frequently; and
  * avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.



To ensure that you are in a secure area of our website before sending Personal Data to us, please look at the bottom right of your website browser and check that it displays an image of a closed padlock or an unbroken key.
