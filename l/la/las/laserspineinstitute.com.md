Disclosures made in reliance on the authorization prior to the revocation are not affected by the revocation. 

## Patient Rights Related to Protected Health Information

Although your health record is the physical property of the facility that compiled it, the information belongs to you. You have the right to: 

**_Request an Amendment_**

You have the right to request that we amend your medical information if you feel that it is incomplete or inaccurate. You must make this request in writing to our Director of Health Information Management, stating what information is incomplete or inaccurate and the reasoning that supports your request. 

We are permitted to deny your request if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request. We may also deny your request if: 

  * The information was not created by us, or the person who created it is no longer available to make the amendment. 
  * The information is not part of the record which you are permitted to inspect and copy. 
  * The information is not part of the designated record set kept by this facility or if it is the opinion of the health care provider that the information is accurate and complete.

You have the right to request a restriction of how we use or disclose your medical information for treatment, payment, or health care operations. For example - you could request that we not disclose information about a prior treatment to a family member or friend who may be involved in your care or payment for care. Your request must be made in writing to the Director of Health Information Management. 

We are not required to agree to your request if we feel it is in your best interest to use or disclose that information. If we do agree, we will comply with your request except for emergency treatment. 

As stated later in this notice, under HITECH, if a patient pays in full for their services out of pocket they can demand that the information regarding the service not be disclosed to the patient's third party payer since no claim is being made against the third party payer. 

**_Inspect and Copy_**

You have the right to inspect and copy the protected health information that we maintain about you in our designated record set for as long as we maintain that information. This designated record set includes your medical and billing records, as well as any other records we use for making decisions about you.

As stated later, HITECH expands this right, giving individuals the right to access their own e-health record in an electronic format and to direct LSI to send the e-health record directly to a third party. LSI may only charge for labor costs under electronic transfers of e-health records. 

**_An Accounting of Disclosures_**

You have the right to request a list of the disclosures of your health information we have made outside of our facility that were not for treatment, payment, or health care operations.

Your first request for a list of disclosures within a 12-month period will be free. If you request an additional list within 12-months of the first request, we may charge you a fee for the costs of providing the subsequent list. We will notify you of such costs and afford you the opportunity to withdraw your request before any costs are incurred.

You have the right to request how we communicate with you to preserve your privacy. For example - you may request that we call you only at your work number, e-mail or by mail at a special address or postal box.

## HITECH Amendments

LSI is including HITECH Act provisions to its Notice as follows:

**_HITECH Notification Requirements_**

Under HITECH, LSI is required to notify patients whose PHI has been breached. Notification must occur by first class mail within 60 days of the event. A breach occurs when an unauthorized use or disclosure that compromises the privacy or security of PHI poses a significant risk for financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual.   
This notice must:  


  1. Contain a brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of discovery;
  2. The steps the individual should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the breach;
  3. A brief description of what LSI is doing to investigate the breach, mitigate losses, and to protect against further breaches.



**_Business Associates_**

LSI's Business Associate Agreements have been amended to provide that all HIPAA security administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, technical safeguards and security policies, procedures, and documentation requirements apply directly to the business associate.

**_Cash Patients/Clients_**

HITECH states that if a patient pays in full for their services out of pocket they can demand that the information regarding the service not be disclosed to the patient's third party payer since no claim is being made against the third party payer.

**_Access to E-Health Records_**

HITECH expands this right, giving individuals the right to access their own e-health record in an electronic format and to direct LSI to send the e-health record directly to a third party. LSI may only charge for labor costs under the new rules.

**_Accounting of E-Health Records for Treatment, Payment, and Health_**

LSI does not currently have to provide an accounting of disclosures of PHI to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations. However, starting January 1, 2014, the Act will require LSI to provide an accounting of disclosures through an e-health record to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations. This new accounting requirement is limited to disclosures within the three-year period prior to the individual's request. 

LSI must either: (1) provide an individual with an accounting of such disclosures it made and all of its business associates disclosures; or (2) provide an individual with an accounting of the disclosures made by LSI and a list of business associates, including their contact information, who will be responsible for providing an accounting of such disclosures upon request.
