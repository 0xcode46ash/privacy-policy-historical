**Information We Collect**

LasVegas.com collects personally identifiable information ("PII") about you that you specifically and **voluntarily** provide. Please understand that before you may purchase any of the products and services available on our Site, you must provide some PII to us. PII includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your full name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. Upon our request, you may also choose to **voluntarily** provide additional PII to us, such as your age, gender, marital status, hobby information, travel preferences, etc. LasVegas.com will use PII provided by you to create a profile about you in the [My Profile](https://reservations.lasvegas.com/lv/mbrDisplayProfiles.jsp?storefront=1001) area of your member account. Lastly, we may gather PII through your **voluntary** agreement to (i) subscribe to our newslist and (ii) participate in surveys, polls, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes sponsored by us. 

LasVegas.com collects PII in order to: (1) tailor your experience at our Site to your interests, (2) help us continually refine the Site and improve the services we offer, (3) provide you with information about promotions and offers through e-mail and on the Site that we believe will be of interest to you, (4) complete air, car, hotel, show ticket, and restaurant reservations, and (5) allow us contact you for customer service, if necessary. PII that we may collect is described below: 

  * **Membership information.** When you register to become a member of LasVegas.com, we ask you to choose a username and password, and we ask you to provide your e-mail address. We use this information to create your member account and will send you a "Welcome to LasVegas.com" e-mail to verify that the information you provided is correct and to provide explanatory information to you relating to our Site. Unless you have checked the box to allow us to save this information, you must provide this information each time you log on to our Site. Although you are required to register as a member of LasVegas.com in order to use selected travel planning tools, and some PII is needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, many areas of LasVegas.com can be accessed without providing any PII. 
  * **Traveler Profile Information.** When a travel reservation is made, LasVegas.com collects the full name, address, and contact phone numbers for each traveler. You may also be asked to include information about each traveler's preferences, such as seat selection, meal requests, frequent flyer and awards programs and any applicable membership numbers, and ticketing options. This information is stored in the [My Profile](https://reservations.lasvegas.com/lv/mbrDisplayProfiles.jsp?storefront=1001) area of a member's LasVegas.com account. One benefit of providing this information to us is that it will be quicker for you when making future reservations, as you will not have to type the same information repeatedly. If you choose not to provide us with information relating to your traveling preferences, you may still purchase travel services on our Site. When you purchase travel products and services for someone else on LasVegas.com, we may collect PII and travel preferences about that individual. Because they will be unable to view or change any information you provide on their behalf, you should obtain the consent of those individuals prior to providing LasVegas.com with their PII. 
  * **Travel Purchase Information.** LasVegas.com collects the credit card information (including card number, type, and expiration date), the cardholder's name, and the billing address of the credit card used to purchase travel. This information is also stored in the [My Profile](https://reservations.lasvegas.com/lv/mbrDisplayProfiles.jsp?storefront=1001) area of your member account. 
  * **Promotions, Contests, and Sweepstakes Information.** LasVegas.com may offer Site visitors and our members the chance to participate in promotions, contests, or sweepstakes; your participation is voluntary. Those individuals participating in such activities will be requested to provide PII, including their full name, e-mail address, and street address, which we would use to contact you in the event that you are a winner. 
  * **Surveys and Polls.** LasVegas.com may also request Site visitors and our members to participate in polls and surveys; your participation is voluntary. We will use information gathered through such polls and surveys to develop additional features, content, and promotions on the Site. 
  * **Information collected when you contact LasVegas.com.** When you contact LasVegas.com with a question, comment, suggestion, or request for assistance, you may be required to provide PII, such as your full name, username, e-mail address, and/or contact phone numbers. If you personally contact or send communications to LasVegas.com, authorized employees may update your member profile to reflect any new PII received from you.

Examples include providers that fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal mail, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, and provide customer service. We only share PII with service providers relating to travel that is either reserved or purchased on LasVegas.com. Our service providers need your PII (i.e. your traveler profile and your credit card information) to process and confirm your travel reservation. These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to travel suppliers (hotel, airline, show venues, and/or rental car suppliers) whose products you have purchased. Similar to travel arranged through a travel agent, your PII must be shared with our travel suppliers to confirm your reservation and travel preferences. Although LasVegas.com offers travel products from hotel, airline, show venues, and rental car suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on our travel suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission.

In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation. 

  * **Third Parties Engaged to Conduct Surveys, Promotions, or Sweepstakes.** LasVegas.com may contract with a reputable third party to facilitate the distribution of survey, poll, promotion, contest, or sweepstakes programs. This information is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely in connection with completing the project for which the third party was engaged. Upon completion of these projects, all information is returned to LasVegas.com. 
  * **Other Web sites.** There are several places throughout LasVegas.com that may link you to other Web sites that do not operate under LasVegas.com's information privacy practices, even though in some instances we may brand another site with our look and feel or frame its website with our own. When you click through to these Web sites, LasVegas.com's information privacy practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements for all third-party Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your PII. 
  * **Other Disclosure Obligations.** In addition to the circumstances described above, LasVegas.com may disclose your PII if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, to enforce our Site Terms and Conditions and our Purchasing Terms and Conditions, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of LasVegas.com when we have reason to believe that disclosing your PII is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. It may also be necessary for LasVegas.com to provide member information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business. Finally, in the event we were to sell our business, member information would likely be one of the transferred assets. For more information on a sale of our assets see the "Changes to the Las Vegas Privacy Policy" below.
