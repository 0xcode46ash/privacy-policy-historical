# Policies

AACC is committed to honoring the privacy of our visitors. We have designed the site to minimize the gathering of personal data, and we do not collect any personally-identifying data unless you voluntarily provide it or authorize us or our partners to collect it.

AACC does collect non-personal data to help us understand how the site is being used – and how we can improve it. Our web server log also collects certain non-personal information such as the domain you are using to surf the web (e.g., users of your ISP will show up as "ISPname.com") and the page from which you linked to our site, if indeed you followed a link from elsewhere on the web.

AACC uses a third-party advertising company, eHealthcare Solutions (EHS), to serve ads when you visit our website. EHS uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Their use of cookies enables them to serve more relevant ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. They may use non-identifying information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by EHS, see their [Preference Manager](http://preferences.truste.com/2.0/?type=ehs&affiliateId=151). You may also review eHealthcare Solutions' [Privacy Policy](http://ehealthcaresolutions.com/Privacy).

The Lab Tests Online website invites users to submit personally-identifiable data, such as your name and email address, along with questions or comments about the site, or about your experiences in the healthcare system. We collect this data only so that we may contact you with a response to your questions or comments, or to follow up with questions of our own. If you have indicated that you are interested in receiving updates about the site, we will use your email address to send you an email noting such updates. WE DO NOT SELL, TRADE, EXCHANGE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OTHER COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION.

We will not send you unsolicited information, commercial offers, and advertisements.

This site contains links to other sites. AACC and our collaborating partners are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
