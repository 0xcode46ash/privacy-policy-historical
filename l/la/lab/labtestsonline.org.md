AACC and its collaborating partners are committed to honoring the privacy of our visitors. We have designed the site to minimize the gathering of personal data; we will not do so without first alerting you to the fact.

This is not to say that we do not collect data to help us understand how the site is being used – and how we can improve it. Obviously, we do collect the information you submit on any of the several forms found on this site. This information is invaluable to our ability to serve you better. Our web server log also collects certain non-personal information such as the domain you are using to surf the web (e.g., users of your ISP will show up as "ISPname.com") and the page from which you linked to our site, if indeed you followed a link from elsewhere on the web.

If you give it to us, we may sometimes use your email address to contact you with questions about your comments. Periodically, we may use your email address and other information you have provided us to send you updates about our services – only if you have indicated that you are interested in receiving such updates. WE DO NOT SELL, TRADE, EXCHANGE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO ANY OTHER COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION.

We will not send you unsolicited information, commercial offers, and advertisements.

This site contains links to other sites. AACC and our collaborating partners are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Removing Your Email Address**  
If you would no longer like to receive email updates from us, please complete our [Contact Us form](https://web.archive.org/contact/?gc=20) using "unsubscribe" as the Subject. We will delete your name from our mailing list upon receipt of such an email. 

You may also [use this same form](https://web.archive.org/contact/?gc=33) to send us any questions you may have about our privacy policy. It will be helpful if you would select "privacy" as your subject.
