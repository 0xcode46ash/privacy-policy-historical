Large Animal respects your right to enjoy our games without interference or intrusion. We never install pop-up ads or spyware along with any of our games, we never send you email if you are not signed up for our email club, and we will not share any contact information you give us with anyone. 

That said, Large Animal is always trying to provide you with the best games, E-cards and contests possible. Therefore, we sometimes request information from you that helps us improve our games, improve our website, and improve your experience when you visit Largeanimal.com. Here is a little more information about the information we collect: 

**What information do we collect. Why do we collect it?**  
Large Animal collects information from you, the player, to see which games you are enjoying the most. For example, we talked to folks playing RocketBowl when it first came out and they said it was too easy. We adjusted the difficulty and released a newer, harder version that many people have been much happier with.   
All of our efforts taken regarding this information are aimed at making our games more fun for you, the player. 

**Required Information**  
For our web games, we do not require any information. We just ask that you enjoy them and keep on coming back!   
For our deluxe games, all we require is a valid email address so that we can get you the appropriate information about the game you are purchasing. For example, if we didnâ€™t have the email addresses for those people who bought RocketBowl, we never would have been able to send them the free updates mentioned above. 

**Voluntary Information**  
We love to hear what you think about our games! Feel free to stop by the Large Animal discussion boards at www.largeanimal.com/boards or take part in one of our polls at the Largeanimal.com homepage. 

Thanks, 

The Large Animals
