## How we use this information

#### General Information

By applying for a Credit Account you consent to a credit search. If we perform a credit search, we will search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search, whether or not credit is granted. This search may also include people with whom you are ‘financially linked’ or your ‘associates’. You are financially linked or associated with someone if you have applied for or hold joint credit agreements or accounts with them. This search will be seen by other lenders who use the information to make credit decisions about you. We will use this information, in conjunction with credit scoring methods, to assess your application, and to verify your identity. To prevent or detect fraud, or to assist in verifying your identity, we may also make searches of the records of other companies within the Redcats’ group. If we enter into a credit agreement with you, we will supply details of your agreement with us to the credit reference agencies, as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it. If you do not repay on time or in full we will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All of this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and may be used by them to make decisions about whether or not to lend to you or your financial associates. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering. We, the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. We may also pass information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect ourselves and our customers from theft and fraud. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this. We may also use your information held within the Redcats group of companies, including shopping habits, to run your Credit Account. We may make periodic searches of the records of the Redcats group of companies, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes. If you require details of the credit reference agencies from whom we obtain, and with whom we record information about you, please write to us or telephone us on 0844 842 2222. Calls cost 5p per minute plus connection charge from BT landlines of less than 6p. Mobile/ other providers’ charges may vary.
