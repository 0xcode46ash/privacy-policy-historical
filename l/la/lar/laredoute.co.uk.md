### Privacy policy

#### Your confidentially and privacy

We guarantee to protect your privacy. We take great care to make sure you receive the best protection possible for your personal information and any financial details that you provide. The La Redoute website is a secure site, and any personal data we collect from you is safe from misuse.

We abide by the Data Protection Act 1998 and we make sure that any personal information we hold is handled properly. This means that your information will be fairly and lawfully processed, that we will make sure that it is accurate, and that your information is not kept for longer than necessary. Your information will be kept secure and processed in line with your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 and will not be transferred to countries without adequate protection.

#### Information we might need from you:

Your name, date of birth, address, customer number, telephone number, e-mail address, credit/debit card number, expiry date and issue number. If you enter a prize draw we need your name, address, customer number and e-mail address.

#### How we use this information:

We use the information you provide to

  * confirm the receipt of your order, process it and keep you informed of progress
  * keep you up to date with new services, facilities, special offers and promotions
  * enhance your shopping experience in the future by tailoring the site to meet your needs
  * administer prize draws.
  * administer your shopping account with us 
  * administer your Credit Account with us, if you have one (see [T&C’s](https://web.archive.org/Static/Static.aspx?page=terms) for details).



We may also use the information you provide to perform a credit search. We will perform a credit search if:

  * you apply for a Credit Account with us; or
  * you are a new customer and you order a catalogue; or
  * if you are an existing customer and we are increasing your credit limit.



#### Catalogue

We will send you our seasonal catalogue whilst you have an active account with us. We will continue to do this until such time that there has been no activity on your account or the account it closed.

#### Marketing

In addition to sending you our seasonal catalogue which we will continue to do whilst you have an active account with us, we would like to keep you informed about our new products and any special offers throughout the season. We will contact you by post, telephone and email unless you have asked us not to do so. We may also share your details with third parties who provide products or services that may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive marketing information from us or third parties, please contact our Customer Care Team or send an e-mail to [helpline@redoute.co.uk](mailto:helpline@redoute.co.uk). Please include your name and customer number and the method of contact from either Redcats or third parties (email, telephone or post) that you want to stop. Alternatively, if you are registered with My Account, you can sign in, go to “View my details” and change any of the permissions you have given us. 

#### Credit Search

If we perform a credit search, we will search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search, whether or not credit is granted. This search may also include people with whom you are “financially linked” or your “associates”. You are financially linked or associated with someone if you have applied for or hold joint credit agreements or accounts with them. This search will be seen by other lenders who use the information to make credit decisions about you.

We will use this information, in conjunction with credit scoring methods, to assess your application, and to verify your identity. 

To prevent or detect fraud, or to assist in verifying your identity, we may also make searches of the records of other companies within the Redcats’ group. 

If we enter into a credit agreement with you, we will supply details of your agreement with us to the credit reference agencies, as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it. If you do not repay on time or in full we will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All of this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and may be used by them to make decisions about whether or not to lend to you or your financial associates. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering.

We, the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. 

We may also pass information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect ourselves and our customers from theft and fraud. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this. 

We may also use your information held within the Redcats group of companies, including shopping habits, to run your Credit Account. 

We may make periodic searches of the records of the Redcats group of companies, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes. 

If you require details of the credit reference agencies from whom we obtain, and with whom we record information about you, please write to us or telephone us on 0844 842 2222. Calls cost 5p per minute plus connection charge from BT landlines of less than 6p. Mobile/ other providers’ charges may vary.
