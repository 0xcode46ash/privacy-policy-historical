**  
Whenever you browse the [http://www.landrover.co.uk](http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/ "lr - Land Rover") website, read pages, or download information, our computers automatically record certain information about your visit from the computer you use to access our site. 

  
This information does not identify you personally. It just tells us how many visitors come to our site and the types of computers they use. With this information, we can improve our site for all our visitors and make it more useful to you.

  
The information includes the following:  
1 The date and time you access our site.   
2 How many and which pages you visit during a 'session' on our site and how long you were on the site.  
3 Your Internet domain name (this might be your internet service provider such as aol.com or your place of work) and the 'IP' address (this is a number assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web) which allows you to access our website.   
4 The Internet browser you use (e.g. Microsoft Explorer or Netscape) and your computer's operating system (e.g. Windows 98).  
5 The site you were on before you linked to rangerover.com / landrover.com (e.g. Yahoo if you found us from a search engine).

PROTECTION OF EMAIL ADDRESSES** Your email address is only used for the purposes of replying to you unless you have given consent as detailed above.

**  
DATA PROTECTION ON PIXEL TAGS** We may use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
