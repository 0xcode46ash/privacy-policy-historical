By helping to make these connections, we hope to introduce you to new products that are compatible with your interests and needs. Rest assured that your email address and confidential credit card information are never shared with any other company or third party.

## Mmmm, Cookies

"Cookies" are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer. They find their way to your browser via a Web server. They sound friendly and helpful because they are.
