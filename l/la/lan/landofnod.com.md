# Land of Nod: Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY

Thanks a million for shopping at landofnod.com. It’s no secret that we take your privacy seriously. Rest assured we’ve done our best to ensure the security and confidentiality of your transactions and communications with us. 

Getting to Know You  
When you make a purchase on landofnod.com, place an order through our call center, purchase at one of our store locations, create a registry, enter a sweepstakes, provide a product review or answer one of our surveys you may choose to give us basic information such as name, mailing address, email address, zip code, phone number and credit card number. If you shop with us on our website, we may collect more information such as your internet service provider’s address, the name of the web page directing you and your clicks and activity on our site. We also take note of the purchases you have made in the past in order to better understand your unique customer preferences. 

Why We Collect Your Information  
All of this information is used to provide you with the highest caliber of customer service and to make your shopping experience at The Land of Nod the best it can possibly be. We may send you an email to notify you of your order confirmation or a change to your order status. We also communicate new additions to our product assortment and special savings via our emails and catalog mailings. Because of our commitment to safety, we may need to contact you via phone or your postal address to inform you of any potential product safety issues that may arise. In addition, our merchants use purchase information and online product reviews to help them continue to seek out products and designs that you may find relevant and unique. 

How The Land of Nod Contacts You  
If you make a purchase, create a registry, request a catalog or sign up for our email list we will notify you of new product introductions and sales through our catalog mailings and our emails. If you prefer to not receive materials from The Land of Nod, you may opt out at any time. To opt out of emails, you may unsubscribe directly from the email that was sent to you. For email and/or catalog mailings you may also call our customer service department at 800.933.9904 or email them at [customerservice@landofnod.com](mailto:customerservice@landofnod.com). If you prefer to receive less frequent catalog mailings from The Land of Nod, please call us at 800.933.9904 and indicate if you would like to receive one, two or four catalogs per year. Please note that it could take up to eight weeks for your no mail request to be processed. When contacting us, please be sure to include your full name, mailing address, source code and customer code on the back of your catalog. 

Information Sharing  
Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking. When you make a purchase with us, your name and mailing address is shared with other select catalogs or companies whose products and services you may find useful. By helping to make these connections, we hope to introduce you to new products that are compatible with your interests and needs. Rest assured that your email address and confidential credit card information are never shared with any other company or third party. 

We appreciate and respect that not all customers would like to benefit from the sharing of information with other companies. If you do not want The Land of Nod to share your customer name and mailing address, please immediately contact us at 800.933.9904 or at [customerservice@landofnod.com](mailto:customerservice@landofnod.com) and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies. Please note that it could take up to eight weeks for this request to be processed. When contacting us, please be sure to include your full name, mailing address, source code and customer code on the back of your catalog. 

If we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing harm to you or The Land of Nod, we may disclose your personal information. Again, this is an unlikely event and we will only release information if the law requires it. 

Protecting Children's Privacy  
The Land of Nod adheres to a strict privacy code regarding children and does not knowingly accept personal information from any child. If it is brought to our attention that a subscriber is underage, we will immediately remove all personal and identifiable information from our records in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. In addition, we will not disclose this information to any other companies. To prevent a child’s name from being added to our database, we suggest that you refrain from listing your child’s name as the purchaser or recipient on an order. 

Secure Shopping  
We take all reasonable steps to protect our customers’ personal information against loss, misuse and alteration. We use encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your personal information on our site. 

When you make a purchase online, either a solid key or a locked padlock icon will appear in the lower right of your browser window. This icon indicates that your transaction session is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If you're still concerned about ordering electronically, you can place your order by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 800.933.9904.
