Lanyon Privacy Policy
Introduction:
The mission of Lanyon is to connect Buyers and Suppliers
together in an on-line marketplace to facilitate the communication
of content and the contracting of rates.
Being part of Lanyon means, in some cases, sharing information
about yourself with other professionals, and communicating with
them during the contracting processes.
By default, individual hotels, hotel chains and corporate
customers, are set up in the Lanyon database with contact
information so that only correct and authorized information gets
shared in the marketplace. This contact information is work-
related and only contains personal information necessary to
identify the contact and their role in the organization.
Here are the three main types of information on Lanyon:
Information about yourself that you share. This is the information
that Lanyon customers see about you. This includes your name
and contact details, including the hotel, corporation or other
business entity you are associated to in the marketplace. You have
control over this content, and you can update information at
any time.
Communication. We help you communicate with other Lanyon
marketplace users using built-in email mechanisms. This email
communication is one-to-one and is based on standard
notifications which are generated from the Lanyon systems. They
do not require you to respond to these emails and share any
additional information, and are primarily emails notifying you to
log in to Lanyon to perform some action(s). You decide upon the
action you wish to take upon receiving these notifications.
Private activity. We also provide tools that you use during the
course of solicitation, negotiation, and content distribution. We
encourage you to only use the built-in notifications for any


communication in the marketplace and to not use the contact
information for any private means.
Of course, maintaining your trust is our top concern, so we adhere
to the following principles to protect your privacy:
   We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally
    identifiable information to third parties unless it is in the
    course of their use of the marketplace or is with your express
    consent, except as described in this policy or as required by
    law.
   All information that you provide will be protected with
    industry standard protocols and technology.
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so
please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this
policy, we will notify you here, by means of a notice on our home
page so that you may access and review the changes to this
document in advance of your continued use of the service. If you
object to any changes, you may contact us by emailing us at
privacy@lanyon.com or through one of our support and account
management teams. By continuing to use the Lanyon service after
notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the Lanyon
website, you are consenting to the changes.
Please read this policy and send us questions, concerns and
suggestions to privacy@lanyon.com
What Lanyon’s Privacy Policy Covers:
 1. Information collected by Lanyon.
 2. How Lanyon uses your information.
 3. Your information choices.
 4. Your obligations as a User.


5. Important information regarding service eligibility and US
   Department of Commerce Safe Harbor certification.
6. Security.
7. How to contact us.
1. Information Collected
  The mission of Lanyon is to connect Buyers and Suppliers
  together in an on-line marketplace to facilitate the
  communication of content and the contracting of rates. To
  achieve this mission, Lanyon makes features and functionality
  available through our websites, including our mobile and other
  applications, developer platform, and other information
  provided as part of the Lanyon services (“Services”) to enable
  hotels, hotel chains, airlines, car rental companies and other
  hospitality industry suppliers to interact with hospitality buyers
  such as corporations, travel management companies, agencies,
  and consortia. By joining Lanyon, you voluntarily and willingly
  provide Lanyon Corporation, a company headquartered in
  Irving, Texas, USA, certain information, including some
  limited personally identifiable information, which we collect in
  order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about
  providing information to us and/or having your information
  displayed on the Lanyon website or otherwise used in any
  manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User
  Agreement, you should contact us immediately at
  privacy@lanyon.com
   We collect your personal information in the following ways:
    A. Creating a User ID and Login
       In order to become a User, a User ID and password are
       created for you. A minimum set of information is required
       to create a User Login: name, email address, and
       password. Without this minimal amount of information,
       you cannot create a Lanyon User ID. In some cases a User


   ID and Password are created on your behalf, such as when
   a hotel is built in the system. In these instances it is often a
   colleague in your organization who has made the request
   or created a User ID on your behalf.
   Your password can be changed and updated at any time by
   you. We encourage you to ensure your password is known
   only by you. In the event your User ID and password is
   created for you, we encourage you to change the password
   when you log in for the first time, so that your password is
   known only to you.
   Lanyon enables other information to be collected from you
   during the User ID creation process, (e.g., gender,
   location, etc.) that Lanyon can then use to provide better,
   more customized services. If you feel uncomfortable about
   providing this additional information then do not, as you
   are not required to do so in order to use Lanyon’s core
   services. You acknowledge that this information is
   personal to you, and by creating an User ID on Lanyon,
   you allow others, including Lanyon, to identify you and to
   allow Lanyon to use your information to display and send
   notifications to you.
B. Profile Information
   Once you become a User, you may provide additional
   information to your Lanyon contact information such as
   gender and location. Providing additional information
   about yourself beyond what is minimally required at
   registration is entirely up to you. Any information you
   provide at registration or in the contacts section may be
   used by Lanyon as described in this Privacy Policy,
   including for the purpose of allowing Lanyon marketplace
   users to find you on Lanyon, and send you notifications
   such as the solicitation, or response to, a contracted rate or
   piece of hotel related data.
   Your contact information will be displayed to authorized
   and legitimate Lanyon users in order for them to select you


   as a recipient of a notification. This notification will then
   be sent through the Lanyon system to your email address.
   You may also choose to manually enter or upload data
   about your contacts to the “Contacts” section of your
   profile on Lanyon.
C. Customer Service
   We collect information when you interact with Lanyon’s
   customer support or account management teams in order
   to accurately recognize you and respond to customer
   inquiries . In some cases this includes requesting your
   User ID, your name, and your email address, or other
   related information. If you do not wish to give this
   information for identification purposes, you may elect to
   send an email to our support teams to assist.
D. Using the Lanyon Site and Applications
   We receive information when you interact with and use the
   Lanyon websites and Lanyon Applications (e.g. Lanyon
   Content Control Center (“3C”), Lanyon corporate transient
   sourcing tool, etc. This information is for the purpose of
   identifying you and ensuring the correct services are
   provided to you when you login. If you have any concerns
   with this you may contact us at privacy@lanyon.com
E. Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites
   In some cases we receive information when you use your
   log in to a web site or application provided by your
   company. In those instances you log in to a company web
   site or application, if your company has elected to set up
   an automatic sign-in to Lanyon, your User ID and
   password may be automatically sent Lanyon to log in
   simultaneously to a Lanyon web site or application. If you
   are unsure when this occurs or if you have any concerns on
   this process please contact your company administrator or
   the Lanyon support or account management teams.
   Lanyon will only use Log in this information to give


   access to you to an authorized Lanyon web site and
   application and in some cases to personalize the Lanyon-
   provided functionality.
F. Advertising and Web Beacons
   Lanyon provides advertising opportunities for users in
   some of its sites and services. These advertisements are
   directed towards the Lanyon applications and web sites
   and will not be emailed or sent to you directly.
G. Log files, IP Addresses and information about your
   computer
   Due to the communications standards on the internet,
   when you visit the Lanyon website we automatically
   receive the URL of the site from which you came and the
   site to which you are going when you leave Lanyon.
   Lanyon may also receive the internet protocol (“IP”)
   address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to
   access the World Wide Web), your computer operating
   system and type of web browser you are using. Lanyon
   does not store, track, or use this information.
H. Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information
   About You
   You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate
   the data you supplied to Lanyon, such as your contact
   information. If you update any of your information, we
   may keep a copy of the information that you originally
   provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this
   policy. You may request deletion of your information at
   any time by contacting Lanyon’s support or account
   management teams. We will respond to your request
   within 30 days. Please note, however that information you
   have shared with others, or that other Users have copied,
   may also remain visible even if you request its deletion.
I. Data Retention


       Lanyon will retain your information for so long as your
       account is active or as needed to provide you with the
       services you have licensed.
       We will retain and use your information as necessary to
       comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
       enforce this Agreement.
2. Uses of personal information
    A. Consent to Lanyon Processing Information About You
       The information you provide to Lanyon such as name,
       business telephone number, and email address may reveal,
       or allow others to identify, your nationality, gender, or
       location. By providing information to us for the purposes
       of creating your User ID or adding any additional details
       to your Lanyon profile, you are expressly and voluntarily
       accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
       Supplying information to Lanyon, including any
       information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is
       entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to
       withdraw your consent to Lanyon’s collection and
       processing of your information at any time, in accordance
       with the terms of this Privacy Policy by contacting us at
       privay@lanyon.com but please note that your withdrawal
       of consent will not be retroactive from the point that this
       request is received and processed.
    B. Lanyon Communications
       As described in this Privacy Policy and the Lanyon User
       Guides, we will communicate with you through email,
       notices posted on the Lanyon websites, messages to your
       Lanyon message center, or through other means available
       through the service, including, in some cases, mobile text
       messages. We may send you a series of emails that help
       inform new Users about the features of Lanyon services,
       and we will also send you service messages relating to the
       functioning of the Services.


   You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any
   time by logging into your account and changing your
   contact information.
   Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving
   service messages from Lanyon whilst you are licensed to
   receive those services . Also, if we send communications
   to you via the carrier service with which you have a
   mobile communications subscription or otherwise have
   access, you understand you will pay any service fees
   associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile
   device (including text messaging charges).
C. User Communications
   Communications you initiate through Lanyon (e.g., an
   solicitation invitation sent to a Lanyon user) may in some
   cases list your primary business email address and name in
   the header of the message.
D. Sharing Information with Third Parties
   Lanyon takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and
   we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally
   identifiable information to third parties, except as
   described in this policy.
E. Customer Surveys
   Customer Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Lanyon.
   As a User, you may be invited to participate in polls and
   surveys from the Lanyon website, by the Lanyon support
   and account management teams, or an authorized 3rd party
   working on behalf of Lanyon. Your selection may be
   random, or it may be based on your non-personally
   identifiable information, such as job title, company,
   company size, user type and/or location. Whether or not
   you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely
   up to you.


       Lanyon may follow up with you via email regarding your
       participation or your responses.
    F. Press Releases
       If you agree to provide any testimonials about the Lanyon
       Services, we may post those testimonials and press
       releases to the Lanyon web site and/or to various
       hospitality web sites. Testimonials and releases may
       include your name and other personal information that you
       have provided. In all instances, the content and distribution
       of these releases will be agreed and authorized by you in
       advance.
    G. Compliance with Legal Process
       It is possible that we may need to disclose personal
       information, profile information and/or information about
       your activities as a Lanyon User when required by
       subpoena or other legal process, or if Lanyon has a good
       faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate,
       prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal
       activities or to assist government enforcement agencies;
       (b) to enforce a user agreement or licence, to investigate
       and defend ourselves against any third party claims or
       allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our

       personal safety of Lanyon, our Users, employees, or

       us during the creation of your User ID and contact
       information and make any desired changes to the
       information, at any time by logging in the Lanyon website.
       Please be aware that even after your request for a change is
       processed, Lanyon may, for a time, retain residual


        information about you in its backup and/or archival copies
        of its database.
4. Your Obligations
    As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some
    of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and
    regulations, and others have become commonplace in on-line
    platforms such as the Lanyon marketplace:
     You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of
      the then-current Privacy Policy. This includes respecting all
      intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties
      (such as trademarks or photographs).
     You must not download or otherwise disseminate any
      information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent,
      offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise
      violate the purpose and spirit of Lanyon and its marketplace.
     You must not provide to Lanyon and/or other Users
      information that you believe might be injurious or
      detrimental to your person or to your professional or social
      status.
     You must keep your username and password confidential
      and not share it with others.
    Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction,
    suspension or termination of your services at the sole
    discretion of Lanyon.
5. Important information
        Safe Harbor
        Lanyon Corp participates in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy
        Framework as administered by the United States
        Department of Commerce as a data controller, and has
        self-certified our privacy practices as consistent with U.S.-
        E.U. Safe Harbor principles: Notice, Choice, Onward


      Transfer, Access and Accuracy, Security, Data Integrity
      and Enforcement.
      Please note that by becoming a User, you have given us
      your express and informed consent to transfer the data that
      you provide to us to the United States and to process it in
      the United States.
      If Users have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy
      Policy, including the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework, you
      should first contact Lanyon at privacy@lanyon.com. If
      you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or it is
      not satisfactorily addressed, you may raise your complaint
      by emailing Lanyon’s CEO at todd.tyler@lanyon.com, by
      fax at +1-866-840-9987, or mail at Lanyon, Inc., 104
      Decker Coutr, Suite 100, Irving, Texas, USA, 75062.
      Changes to this Privacy Policy
      We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or
      without advance notice. In the event there are significant
      changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable
      information, or in the Privacy Policy document itself, we
      will display a notice on the Lanyon website or send you an
      email, so that you may review the changed terms prior to
      continuing to use the Lanyon services. Unless stated
      otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all
      information that Lanyon has about you and your services.
      Using the Lanyon Services after a notice of changes has
      been sent to you or published on our site shall constitute
      consent to the changed terms or practices.
6. Security
      In order to help secure your personal information, access
      to your data on Lanyon is password-protected, and
      sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is
      exchanged between systems. To protect any data you store
      on our servers, Lanyon also regularly audits its system for


       possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one
       secured-access data center. However, since the internet is
       not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or
       warrant the security of any information you transmit to
       Lanyon. There is no guarantee that information may not
       be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of
       any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It
       is your responsibility to protect the security of your login
       information. Please note that emails, instant messaging,
       and similar means of communication with other Users of
       Lanyon are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not
       to communicate any confidential information through
       these means.
7. Cookies
       Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a
       "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract
       any personal information from you. Each time you log
       into the Service, a session cookie containing an encrypted,
       unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed in
       your browser. These session cookies allow the Company
       to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the
       Service and to process your online transactions and
       requests. The Site can only read cookies
       Created by the site. Session cookers are required to use the
       service.
8. IP Addresses
       When you visit Lanyon’s Websites, the Company collects
       your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and
       aggregate non-personally identifiable information. For
       example, Lanyon uses IP addresses to monitor the regions
       from which Customers and Visitors navigate the
       Company’s Web sites, and what browsers they might be
       using.
       Because the Company uses the Service to maintain data
       about Lanyon Customers, this information is secured in
       the same manner as described above for Customer Data.


9. Certain Disclosures
       We may provide non-personally-identifiable information
       to our contractors for the purpose of providing and
       maintaining our services. We require that these parties
       agree to use such information solely for this purpose, and
       we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such
       information and to use other appropriate confidentiality
       and security measures.
       We may release personally identifiable information and/or
       non-personally identifiable information if required to do
       so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is
       necessary to comply with state, federal and international
       laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search
       warrant.
       We also reserve the right to disclose personally
       identifiable information and/or other information about
       you that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or
       necessary to enforce our agreements, take precautions
       against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves
       against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
       government enforcement agencies, to protect the security
       or integrity of our Site, and protect the rights, property, or
       personal safety of us, our users or others.
10. Links to Other Sites
       We are not responsible for the privacy policies of any sites
       that are linked to from the Site or any site that you use to
       access the Site. You should consult the respective privacy
       policies associated with these sites for more information
       on their
       practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain

       cannot control the activities of, such other web sites.
