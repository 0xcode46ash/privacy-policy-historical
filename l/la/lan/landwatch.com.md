This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs. 

**What Information Do We Collect?  
**When you visit LandWatch.com you may provide two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse LandWatch.com.

**Email Information  
**In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. 

**2\. Web Site Use Information  
**Similar to other commercial Web sites, LandWatch.com utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how LandWatch.com is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at LandWatch.com, and the Web sites visited just before and just after LandWatch.com.

**How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?  
**Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to LandWatch.com, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers' personal information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers. 

**What Are Cookies?**   
Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. 

**How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?  
**LandWatch.com uses Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about LandWatch.com users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve LandWatch.com and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve LandWatch.com to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers. 

Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to LandWatch.com as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit LandWatch.com and evaluate LandWatch.com's visitor capacity. LandWatch.com does not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you. 

**Sharing Information with Affiliates  
**From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on LandWatch.com. We take measures to select product or service providers that we believe are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we cannot make any representations or warranties about the practices and policies of these companies. 

**Sharing Information with Strategic Partners  
**LandWatch.com may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you.

Evaluation of Information Protection Practices. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information. 

Employee Access, Training and Expectations. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are designed to protect customer information. In general, our business practices are intended to limit employee access to confidential information and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions, although, like any large organization, we cannot guaranty that information won’t be used in violation of this Privacy Policy and in contravention of our policies and practices.

**What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?  
**We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. 

**What About Other Web Sites Linked to LandWatch.com?  
**We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from LandWatch.com nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of LandWatch.com.
