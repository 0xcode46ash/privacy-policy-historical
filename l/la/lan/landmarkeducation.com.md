Landmark expressly reserves in its sole discretion, and at times and intervals of its choosing, the right to change its Policies and Practices periodically in the future without prior notice to Site Users.

_**_What Information Do We Collect?_**_   Landmark may collect information in conjunction with its marketing and registration for programs and related services and follow up as well as from its program registrants, as part of the registration process for Landmark programs such as the Landmark Forum. From time-to-time, we may also conduct surveys or offer contests or other promotional events, and gather additional information from you in connection with those events. Other than in aggregated, derivative form, we do not share such information with anyone outside Landmark. Any personal information will be kept confidential and used solely by us in accordance with this Policy.
