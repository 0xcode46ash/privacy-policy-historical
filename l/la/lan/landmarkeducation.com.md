Privacy Statement

**LANDMARK EDUCATION  
PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT**  
(Effective  06/29/04)

_**_Introduction: Our Commitment to Your Privacy_.**_ Landmark Education (“Landmark”) is highly sensitive to the confidentiality of information provided by you to Landmark. As a result, Landmark has adopted the following Privacy Policy, which is applicable to all information that you provide to Landmark and that Landmark maintains electronically, whether you provide the information through Landmark's World Wide Web Site (the “Site”) or through other means. You should also review our [Terms and Conditions of Use](http://www.landmarkeducation.com/display_content.jsp?top=31) as they are also applicable and govern your use of the Site. This Policy does not apply to any information that you may provide to third parties, such as through other sites linked to the Landmark Site. You should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective Privacy Policies.

Landmark expressly reserves at its sole discretion, and at times and intervals of its choosing, the right to change its Policies and Practices periodically in the future without prior notice to Site Users. Review our Privacy Policy Statement regularly to be sure you are fully current with our practices and procedures in this area. At present, Landmark uses and discloses the information provided by you for the purposes described below. Landmark will provide you sufficient opportunity to prevent new uses of your personal information by sending an administrative email and posting a prominent notice on Landmark's Site.

This written Policy discloses the information-gathering and dissemination practices for Landmark's Site. This Notice applies to all information collected or submitted on Landmarkeducation.com. As noted above, this Privacy Policy Statement may change from time to time, so please revisit this Notice periodically to ensure your usage of the Site is consistent with the policies and practices governing it. 

_**_What Information Do We Collect?_**_ Landmark may collect information in conjunction with its marketing and registration for programs and related services and follow-up, as well as from its program registrants, as part of the registration process for Landmark programs such as the Landmark Forum. From time to time, Landmark may also conduct surveys or offer contests or other promotional events, and gather additional information from you in connection with those events. Other than in aggregated, derivative form, Landmark does not share such information with anyone outside Landmark. Any personal information will be kept confidential and used solely by Landmark in accordance with this Policy. 

**__What Do We Use this Information For?__** Primarily, Landmark uses your information to provide you with the services available to you. Landmark uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer Landmark's Site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information, some of which Landmark aggregates and then shares with our strategic alliance partners. Landmark may also use your IP address to keep track of the information you have seen on Landmark's Sites. Landmark uses your name, email address, and mailing address to assist Landmark in communicating with you if you ask us to do so. Landmark uses information on your resumé to assist you with job placement.

 _ _ **With Whom Do We Share Your Information?**__

  Landmark may share your information only in aggregated, derivative form with related companies of Landmark and third-party organizations with whom Landmark has entered into marketing agreements, strategic alliances, or other business relationships. 

Landmark may disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Landmark or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Landmark and the Sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Landmark employees or customers.

__**Landmark's Use of Information from Third Parties.**__

**__Contact Information Verification__**. Landmark may use third parties to verify and update customer contact information to ensure customer records are current and accurate. Such third parties will be required to protect the privacy of your information with the same level of protection that Landmark provides and will not release personal information about you to anyone outside of Landmark.

 ** _ _Enhancement of Marketing Profile.__** Landmark may purchase third-party marketing data for its customers in the United States and add it to existing customer databases to better target advertising and offers that may be pertinent to customers.

 _ _ **Correcting/Updating/Deactivating Personal Information.**__

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email, or postal address), or if you no longer desire Landmark's service, you are provided a way to correct, update, or deactivate personally identifiable information. This can be done by contacting Landmark at any of the listings in the contact information section at the end of this document.

 _ _ **Choice: Opt-in/Opt-out.**__

You are given the opportunity to “opt-in” or “opt-out” of having your information used for purposes not directly related to Landmark's Site at the point where information is requested. If you no longer wish to receive Landmark's promotional communications you may opt out of receiving these communications by replying to the email with “unsubscribe” in the subject line or by contacting Landmark at any of the listings in the contact information section at the end of this document.

 ** _ _Security.__** The Site takes every precaution to protect Landmark's customers' information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, your information is protected both online and offline. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, Landmark has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information Landmark collects.

When Landmark's registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry—SSL. While Landmark uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, Landmark also does everything in its power to protect customer information offline. All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screensavers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter their passwords to regain access to customer information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every six months, as well as any time policies are updated, Landmark's employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance Landmark places on privacy, and what they can do to ensure Landmark's customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security of the Site, you can contact us at any of the listings in the contact information section at the end of this document.

__**Public Message Boards and Chat Rooms**__

. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in public message boards and chat rooms becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

 ** _ _Use of Cookies.__** Cookies are a standard technology used by commercial web services to store small pieces of information on your hard drive, by sending a small string of text to your browser. They make your use of the Landmark Site more pleasing and efficient by, for example, “personalizing” your user interface or identifying which parts of a site you have previously visited. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies unless you have configured yours not to accept them. In order for Landmark to provide you with services, your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration and security. Landmark also uses cookies to tailor the information that you receive and for other purposes. 

**__Disclaimer of Responsibility for Privacy Policy and Content at Linked Sites__**. Landmark's Site may provide you with links to other websites. Landmark is not responsible for those sites and cannot control the use of information that you submit once you reach those sites, nor can Landmark control the content of what is offered on those sites or on links from those sites. 

**__BBBOnLine Certification.__** Landmark is a member of the BBBOnLine Privacy Program. BBBOnLine is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Landmark wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, Landmark has agreed to publish our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by BBBOnLine. Landmark also abides by the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

**__Enforcement of this Privacy Statement.__** If you have questions regarding this statement or the enforcement of this statement, you should first contact Landmark at any of the listings in the contact information section at the end of this document. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact BBBOnLine at their web site, [http://www.BBBOnLine.com/consumer/services.asp](http://www.bbbonline.com/consumer/services.asp).
