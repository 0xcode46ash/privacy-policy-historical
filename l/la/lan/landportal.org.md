# Privacy Policy | Landportal

**Introduction**

The Land Portal values its users and is committed to safeguarding their privacy. Our privacy policy is designed to protect individuals with regard to the collection, storage, use, and removal of their personal data.

**What information does the Land Portal collect?**

Every time you visit a web page, you send information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of which web pages are popular, which other sites link to this one, and which web browsers people are using.

It is not the intention of the Land Portal to use this information to keep track of legitimate users. These logs are used to produce the site statistics. The raw log data is not made public and is normally discarded after about six months.

Identification of an author: Simply browsing the web site does not expose your identity publicly. If you only read Land Portal pages, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web server logs in general. If you contribute to the Land Portal, you are publishing everything that you write, edit or post on any page. This is a public act, and you are identified publicly as the author of that edit. Only registered users who are logged in may publish on the Land Portal, in which case you are identified by your user name.

**Cookies:** The Land Portal will set a temporary session cookie whenever you visit the site. You may choose to deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it. It will be deleted when you close your browser session. More cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit. Additionally, the Land Portal uses external services from Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Addthis that track user activities as per the features offered through them (for example, the Facebook “like” button, or Google analytics to capture site statistics). These sites also place cookies on your web browser.

**IP addresses** : An IP address is a series of four numbers that identifies the Internet address from which you are contacting the site. Depending on your connection, this number may be traceable only to a large Internet Service Provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home. It may be possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals. When using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a page by you or by another user with the same IP address. In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the Land Portal servers and can be seen by server administrators and by users who have been granted specific access rights. Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below).

**Additional information is provided here for specific Land Portal services:**

**E-mail:** You must provide your e-mail address to create an account on the Land Portal. Your email address will not be shared with third parties but may be used by the Land Portal coordination team to communicate with its users on a wider scale.

**Newsletters:** If you subscribe to a Land Portal newsletter, your address will be exposed to the managers of these newsletters. An external service called MailChimp is used to send newsletters and news digests.

**Informational email  addresses: **Some email addresses (such as [hello@landportal.info](mailto:hello@landportal.info)) may forward mail to the Land Portal coordination team to respond to feedback and questions from users. Mail sent to the system is not publicly visible, but is visible to the Land Portal coordination team. By sending email to one of these addresses, your email address may become public within this group. The team may discuss the contents of your email with other contributors in order to best answer your query.

**User  data:** Data users share, such as the content and comments they have posted are available to visitors of the Land Portal.

**How long is your information kept?**

When you write something on the Land Portal, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes resources, discussions, user pages and status messages. Some limited exceptions are described below.

**Removal of user  accounts: **Once created, user accounts will generally not be removed, though users have the option of deleting their accounts. Users can also change their usernames. The Land Portal Coordination team reserves the right to deny access to the site and remove user accounts at their sole discretion without notice, particularly for any users who are deemed to have violated any of the Land Portal policies and [terms and conditions of use](http://landportal.info/page/terms-and-conditions-use).

**Deletion of  content: **Removing text from any part of the Land Portal does not automatically delete it. Unless the whole node (e.g., a piece of content, such as a discussion, resource, or organization) is deleted, the part that was removed will be accessible by users with administrative rights to view and restore previous versions. Information can be permanently deleted by those people with access to the servers, but there is no guarantee this will happen except in response to legal action.

**Sharing of information with third parties**

The Land Portal will not sell or share personal information, such as email addresses, with third parties, unless you agree to release this information, or it is required by law to release the information.

**Policy on release of data derived from page logs:** It is the policy of the Land Portal that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database, may be released by the system administrators or users with access rights, in the following situations:

  * In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement
  * With permission of the affected user
  * For investigation of abuse complaints, to the Land Portal Foundation, his/her legal counsel, or his/her designee, when necessary
  * Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues.
  * Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers
  * Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of any of the Land Portal partner organizations, its users or the public.



The Land Portal does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above.

**What If I Don't Want to Share My Information? What additional steps can I take to safeguard my privacy online?**

Registering on the Land Portal is optional. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use the Land Portal. However, you will not be able to contribute information, participate in debates, access products and services like news digests or email, or view full user profiles.

If you are very concerned about privacy, you may take the following steps to further safeguard your privacy online:

**Cookies/cache:** If you are using a public machine and don’t wish to expose your username to future users of the machine, you may clear cookies and the browser cache after use.  
User names: When you register for a Land Portal account, you may choose to log in and publish under a pseudonym instead of your real name.

**Passwords:** The strength of the Land Portal community and interactions between users depends on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions. User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user’s edit history. All users are encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them. No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to public release either directly or indirectly.

**IP Addresses:** If you use a company mail server from home, or telecommute and use a DSL or cable Internet connection, it is likely to be very easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Land Portal contributions. Using a user name is a better way of preserving your privacy in this situation. However, remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity.

**Security**

The Land Portal has implemented policies and procedures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access and to maintain data security in accordance with this privacy policy. However, the Land Portal makes no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide. This information may be available to anyone with access to the servers. The Land Portal Foundation can provide a list of those people on request.

**How to contact us**

If you have any questions or complaints, please email us at [hello@landportal.info](mailto:hello@landportal.info).
