**LandAndFarm.com Privacy Notice**

**For those who view or post LandAndFarm.com listings:**

Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to LandAndFarm.com, our registered listing partners, and our advertisers. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients, customers and visitors. Below, please find below a description of how LandAndFarm.com strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium for all to enjoy.

**  
User Information (Searching)**

All users who view listings on LandAndFarm.com retain complete anonymity where LandAndFarm.com is concerned. As the listings appear in your web browser, LandAndFarm.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. 

  
**Registration Information (Listing)**

LandAndFarm.com regards all personal information collected from its registered partners and customers as confidential, except for those items that appear in the listings, such as Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Numbers and all property data and all other data that is available to public viewers of the web site. All other personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information (credit card / bank information) is kept strictly private. LandAndFarm.com does forward certain property listings to third parties as part of marketing agreements LandAndFarm has with those third parties. LandAndFarm does not sell its customer lists or information in the listings to mass marketing entities, though it reserves the right to do so, with the understanding that we will inform our users of any such agreement on our web site and in our newsletter. As of the date of this notice (8/2001) no such agreements exist.

LandAndFarm.com does collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. LandAndFarm.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting listings and measuring the effectiveness of listings on geographically-based groups of clients and customers and for security purposes to prevent abuse and hacking of our site.

  
**The Use of Cookies**

LandAndFarm.com uses cookies for security. To register or log into LandAndFarm, your browser must allow cookies. We use a non-persistent cookie that contains only a unique identifying number. This number persists on your computer for the duration of your log-in session. It does not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify you once your session is over. We place this cookie on your computer so that we can associate your computer and yours alone with the account information on our servers. Without this cookie would be unable to track each logged-in user from page to page of our site. Though there are security methods that do not require cookies, because we carry credit card and billing information, we have chosen a more secure method of tracking sessions of users, one that utilizes non-persistent cookies. 

  
**Disclosure**

LandAndFarm.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to [the Webmaster](http://www.landandfarm.com/lf/asp/lf_contact.asp).
