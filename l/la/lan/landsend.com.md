Neither your name nor anything about you is sold or shared with any other non-affiliated company or agency.

Their primary function is to help us remember you – and specifically, the computer and Web browser you’re using – by collecting non-personally identifiable information (such as your IP address and browser type). This allows us to provide you with a better, more relevant shopping experience.
