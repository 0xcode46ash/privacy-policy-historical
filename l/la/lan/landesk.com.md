LANDesk is committed to user privacy in our products and services. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy. LANDesk reserves the right to make changes and updates to this policy at any time. By downloading any materials from this site or by providing any personal information to LANDesk via this site, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree to them, do not use the site, download any materials from it, or provide any personal information. 

This policy covers LANDesk's corporate web sites. Some of our subsidiaries or programs have their own, possibly different, policies. LANDesk encourages you to read this privacy policy and those of all Web sites you visit. 

**Types and Uses of Personal Information**

Your personal information is used in the following ways: 

  * User IDs and Passwords—Provide you with access to your profile areas and to protected content. 
  * Account Information—Tells us more about who you are, how to contact you, and your shipping and billing information. Also contains any preferences you have provided, such as language, e-mail format and interests. 
  * Customer Feedback and Support—Provides a mechanism for requesting information from LANDesk. Also used to tell us how we can improve our products, services and site designs.
  * E-mail Correspondence—Used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to distribute information about LANDesk, our products, and services.

We will only use your personal information in the ways specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way in which we use your personal information, unless you consent to the new usage. 

**Security Measures**

We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make an online purchase with us, we encrypt your credit card number. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. 

Authorized third-party agents may also need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third-party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may collect and possibly share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LANDesk's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

**Data Retention**

LANDesk will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected 

**Linked Web Site**

**Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. LANDesk encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: 

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
