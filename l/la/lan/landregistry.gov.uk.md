#### **1\. Websites covered by this statement**

This Privacy Statement covers the collection and use of data on all Land Registry websites except for the Land Registry Online and Land Registry Direct websites which have their own privacy statements.

For the convenience of visitors some pages on our websites contain links to the websites of third parties. Third party websites are outside our control and this privacy statement does not apply to them.

#### **2\. What information we collect**

The information generally falls into two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally Identifiable Information: This information lets us know the specifics of who you are. It may include but is not limited to your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, employer, and job title. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you order a product or service, participate in certain promotional activities, fill out surveys, and correspond with us. We also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you ask that we send products or information directly to other people; in these cases, we will collect the information you submit about the recipient. When you ask us to send products or information directly to other people, you confirm that the recipient has appointed you to act on the recipient's behalf and has agreed to you providing the recipient's personal information to us and to our processing of it in accordance with this privacy statement. It will be clear when you are on a part of our website that requires personal information, because we will ask you for it.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This is information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our website may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our web site, which pages you visit on our website, which website you go to next, which browser you used to come to our website, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and any search terms entered on our website. This Statement also contains more information about how we use cookies and other technology to collect this data.

#### **3\. Why we collect your information**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide customers with a better service and to provide all visitors a smooth, efficient, and personalised experience while using our website. Forms on our site may invite users to give us contact information (including their name and email address). This information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. For example, if you request information on our website, we use your Personally Identifiable Information to fill your order or provide the requested information. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information on an aggregated basis to analyse customer behaviour to help us understand how visitors use our website and to measure interest in the various pages. We use this information to help improve the content of our website, to make it easier to use.

Our site uses forms for customers to request information, products, and services, give feedback etc. We may collect visitor's contact information (for example, their email address), and financial information (such as their bank account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The customer's contact information may be used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Customers may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used where appropriate to bill the customer for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as email addresses) are collected from website visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

Our online surveys may ask customers for contact information (such as their email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

#### **4\. How we use your information**

We gather and use information in a number of ways, including the following:

Online surveys and polling: We collect Personally Identifiable Information from customers who volunteer to complete surveys or participate in polls. We use this information to improve our products and services. This information may be collected directly by Land Registry or a contracted third party.

Newsletters and promotional emails: We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you ask to receive newsletters, promotional emails, and other information. We use this information to provide you with the information you request.

Contact information: If you contact us, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments, including Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to help us provide better service in the event that you contact us again.

We do not sell, trade, or rent to others the Personally Identifiable Information we collect.

#### **5\. Your choices**

Land Registry will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our website in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information without providing you with a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

#### **6\. Accessing and changing your information**

Land Registry seeks to ensure that your information and preferences are accurate and complete. If you wish to view or change your information, where possible you may do this online, in other circumstances please let us know by sending an email with your name, full mailing address, email address, and relevant information about subscriptions and registrations you have with Land Registry to [privacy@landregistry.gov.uk](mailto:privacy@landregistry.gov.uk) and we will use reasonable endeavours to meet your request.

#### **7\. Choice/opt-out**

Our sites provide visitors with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor.

If you do not opt-out at the time that you provide information to us but subsequently decide that you would like to opt-out, you can ask us in one of the following ways to remove your information from our databases so that you do not receive further communications.

  * Send an email to: [privacy@landregistry.gov.uk](mailto:privacy@landregistry.gov.uk)

We use cookies when you visit our website, respond to online surveys or polls, or request information. Accepting the cookies used on our website does not give us access to your Personally Identifiable Information and your browser should allow only our website (and no other) to access the information in any cookie(s) set by us. The information collected permits us to analyse traffic patterns on our website. This can enable us over time to provide you with a better experience on our website by improving the content and making it easier to use.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, there may be some features of our website that will not be available to you and some web pages may not display properly.

Land Registry acknowledges your trust and is committed to protecting the information you provide to us. To prevent unauthorised access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of information, we employ physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

#### **10 Security**

Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include but are not limited to a secured database containing personal data. The database is located off the main server and is not accessible directly.

Whilst we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal data, you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal data in transit from you or to you via the internet.

This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those third-party websites linked to our websites. Third-party websites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
