**Privacy Policy and Cookies** – Parkmatic Publications Limited trading as LandlordZONE, TenantVERIFY, LandlordMONEY, LandlordDEALS and LandlordABROAD is committed to providing you with the highest quality service. 

This includes maintaining your privacy and protecting your personal data. In addition to our **Website Terms of Use** the following policy explains what we and our associated publications do with the personal data we collect about you.

### 1: Why do we have a privacy policy?

There are a number of UK, and international laws which set out important standards regarding information that identifies a living individual. This is known as “personal data.” 

All UK organisations processing personal data must do so fairly and lawfully. They must also be registered with the UK Information Commissioner whose role it is to ensure that organisations comply with their data processing obligations. If you want to, you can view a copy of our data protection notification by visiting the Information Commissioner’s website. 

Our UK Data Protection Registration Number is: Z2161622. Certain rules apply to sending direct marketing information by telephone and email. At Parkmatic Publications Limited we treat all of our obligations seriously and take all necessary steps to comply when we store and process your personal data. 

### 2: What personal data do we collect about you and how?

It is essential that we collect, store and process some of your personal data so that we can give you the best service experience and perform our services efficiently. Some of the information we request is voluntary, and you do not have to provide it. 

### We collect your personal data in a number of different ways, including the following:

  * if you provide it when communicating with us (for example when registering for our services);
  * if you order any of our products or services;
  * if you enter a competition or promotion;
  * if you make payments or modify your account details; and
  * when you visit our websites (for example by cookies and other browser-generated information). 



### 3: How do we use your personal data?

We retain and use your personal data for the following main purposes:  


  * we reserve the right to access and disclose your personal data if we are required to do so by law.
  * providing our services, contacting you and servicing our relationship with you; administration and accounting, billing and auditing and other legal purposes;
  * security, payment verification, preventing and detecting money laundering, fraud and other crime, insurance, credit assessment and administration, tracing debtors and recovering debt. For these purposes, we may also pass on your personal data to third parties;
  * generating statistics on our users, such as the popularity of certain of our services, about the “traffic” visiting our websites. When we do this, your data becomes anonymous and you are not personally identified; and
  * we never sell or share your contact details (e-mail addresses etc) with third parties but we may e-mail broadcast to you from our own servers on advertisers’ behalf where we feel they offer services which may be of use to landlords and property investors. 



### 4: Safeguarding your personal data

We take all reasonable care in the collection, storage, processing and disclosure of your personal data and have implemented internal security procedures so as to minimise the risk that unauthorised parties will be able to access the information. 

Nonetheless, the Internet is an open medium and we cannot guarantee that any information you send to us by email or via our website will not be intercepted or tampered with. To help protect any sensitive personal data and minimise the risk of it being intercepted by unauthorised third parties our secure servers employ industry standard Secure Socket Layer v3 (SSL) or Transport Layer  
Security v1 (TLS) encryption when you submit information to us through our website, for example when using TenantVERIFY. This security is signified by the “https” and the padlock on the URL bar. 

Some older browsers do not allow the use of current SSL technology and we therefore recommend that you use an up-to-date browser for example we recommend Google Chrome. If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer use version 9.0 or later.

You can also help to protect your personal data, by following these guidelines:  


  * choose a password that you will be able to remember but that would be hard for someone to guess. Ideally it should include special characters (such as “?” or “#” for example) and numbers. We recommend that you change it regularly and if you need to write it down, always keep it in a safe place; better still use a password manager on your computer which encrypts the information.
  * make sure that no-one can see the details you are entering when you log-in;
  * if other people have access to your computer, remember to close your browser each time you log-off and end your session and, if possible, clear any history of the websites you have visited and that your browser may have saved or “cached”; and never disclose your access details to anyone.
