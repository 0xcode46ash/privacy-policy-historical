# Privacy Statement | Leidos

Back to top

**Last Updated: August  2018**

Leidos, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Leidos,” “we” or us”) recognizes the importance of protecting the personal information of any visitor to  **[leidos.com](https://www.leidos.com/)** , sites that operate on a related sub-domain, or sites identified as being owned and operated by Leidos (“Leidos websites”). We commit to processing your Personal Information responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection/privacy laws in the countries where we operate. 

This Statement applies to all users of our Leidos websites. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have additional rights, which are explained in the Application of Local Laws section. 

For purposes of this Privacy Statement (or “Statement”), “you” refers to any visitor to a Leidos website.

Some Leidos websites may have a separate or supplemental privacy Statement, policy or notice, which you should review as well. Please also note that the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy can be found here: Leidos.com/Australia. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy, the Leidos Australia Privacy Policy takes precedence.

In the event of a conflict between this Statement and the terms of any agreement(s) between a customer and Leidos, the terms of those agreement(s) will control.

  Current Privacy STATEMENT Changes to PRIOR Privacy STATEMENT 

### Accepting this Statement

You acknowledge that you have read this Statement and that you understand and accept it.

Your use of our Leidos websites and any dispute related to the collection of your Personal Information is subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Terms of Service (including any applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes) and any applicable End User License Agreement.

### Application of Local Laws

This Privacy Statement is intended to comply with relevant applicable laws in the United States and European Economic Area (EEA) and in particular,  **[the General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/)**  (GDPR).  If an applicable local data protection or privacy law provides for a lesser level of protection than that established by this Statement, then this Statement shall prevail.

### Consent to Data Transfer

While Leidos has active businesses in many countries around the globe, we are headquartered in the United States. Thus, if you proceed to use this site, your Personal Information may be transferred to or accessible by entities or individuals in the United States and processed according to the terms described in this Privacy Statement.

Personal Information collected by Leidos may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and/or in any other country where Leidos or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities. Typically, the primary storage location is in the United States or a customer’s region (which may also be the United States), often with a backup to a data center in a different region. Storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, improve performance, and create redundancies to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.

We (or our service providers) may transfer Personal Information from the EEA to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, those countries’ laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a government authority capable of addressing your concerns. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts and written assurances from service providers, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your Personal Information. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the personal data protection in the countries where Leidos operates (such as the United States), please visit: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en>.

By continuing to use this site, you authorize Leidos and its service providers to transfer your Personal Information to – or make it available in – destinations outside your home country and to process it according to this Privacy Statement. You may contact us at **[privacy@leidos.com](mailto:privacy@leidos.com) **for more information about the safeguards used protect your Personal Information if it is transferred outside of your country of residence. 

### What is Personal Information?

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, “Personal Information” generally means data, or a combination of data from one or more sources, that could reasonably identify an individual.

When you visit a Leidos website, the Personal Information collected about you may include, but is not limited to:

  * name;
  * postal address;
  * e-mail address;
  * organization name and job title;
  * telephone number;
  * IP address;
  * network and geo-location; and
  * education and employment history.



If you cannot or choose not to provide us with this Personal Information, we may be unable to provide you with the information or services you have requested.

### Why is this Personal Information Collected?

We generally collect Personal Information on an entirely voluntary basis – in other words, we do not require you to give us your Personal Information. Certain areas of Leidos websites, however, may request your Personal Information so that you can use specific features, learn more about Leidos or access certain content. For example, you may be asked to submit Personal Information if you:

  * watch on-demand content;  
  * submit a contact form to request customer or technical support; 
  * access Investor Relations information;  
  * apply for a job with Leidos; or
  * ask to have a Leidos employee contact you.



### Non-Personal Information, Analytics, and Advertising

We market our business in a number of ways, primarily through digital advertising, owned social media presences, email marketing campaigns and other offline mechanisms. To understand how our marketing or promotional campaigns are performing, one or more of our third-party service providers may collect certain information via our Leidos websites. We and these service providers use several industry standard analytics and tracking tools to collect this information, such as web browsers and flash cookies, web beacons and other, similar technologies. The information we collect includes IP addresses, number of page visits, pages viewed, search engine referrals, browsing activities over time and across other websites following your visit to one or more of our Leidos websites, and responses to offline marketing campaigns through dedicated tracking web addresses.

[ ** _Note_** : Although network or device identifiers such as computer or device IP addresses, serial numbers or other identification numbers are not necessarily personally identifiable, some countries’ laws may define them as Personal Information].

We use Non-Personal information to:

  * identify new visitors to Leidos websites; 
  * recognize returning visitors; 
  * analyze the effectiveness of our website content and marketing or sales-related activities;
  * better understand our audience, customers, or other website visitors; and
  * determine whether website visitors, potential customers and customers might be interested in additional content, new products or services.
