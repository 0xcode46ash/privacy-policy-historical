# Privacy & Security

Privacy Policy  
LetsTalk.com is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure shopping environment. We use the personal information you supply to process your order and make your shopping experience more enjoyable. By using the latest in secure transaction technologies and practicing a strict privacy policy, LetsTalk.com strives to protect your personal information. Read on for details. 

LetsTalk.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site [www.LetsTalk.com](http://www.letstalk.com/). Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact Customer Service by email: at [help@letstalk.com](mailto:help@letstalk.com). If they do not receive acknowledgment of their inquiry or their inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, they should then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process [(http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.php)](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.php). TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve users concerns.

Notification of Changes: If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days

  * What kind of information do we collect?  
We collect information at several stages during your interaction with LetsTalk.com. When you first enter out site, we note your IP address in connection to your shopping cart and to help with administrating the site. As you browse the site, we record your preferences via a cookie so we can serve more targeted information on your next visit. (Learn more about cookies) 

When you buy a product, you give us contact and shipping information (like your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.). Depending on order type, you may also give us payment (credit card) and credit information like Social Security Number, date of birth, and driver's license identification. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to protect you from false purchases made in your name. 

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

  * What if I am reluctant to provide information online?  
Not a problem, you can contact our [customer service](https://web.archive.org/about/contact1.htm) department via phone or email and they can place your order for you. If you elect not to provide the information necessary for a service contract, you may choose to acquire a pre-paid service agreement.
  * What do you do with the information?   
Your contact and shipping information is given only to the service provider, and Federal Express. Your payment information is forwarded only to a third-party credit card approval service to verify your credit card account availability and to process payment. Your personal credit information is forwarded only to the service provider you selected for credit approval and service activation purposes. 

LetsTalk.com may use your information to follow-up on your order and to send you updated information on our company, products and services. Your service provider may also send you similar information. 

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

At checkout, you can opt-out of our mailing list to avoid receiving newsletters on new wireless products and promotions. Our site also provides the opportunity to opt-in to receive mailings without purchasing from LetsTalk.com. All promotional newsletters have instructions on how to be removed from our mailing list. Subscribers may also link to <http://www.letstalk.com/unsubscribe.htm> to opt-out. We do not collect email addresses of recipients of newsletters forwarded by LetsTalk.com subscribers. 

If you prefer not to receive correspondence from LetsTalk.com, you may link to <http://www.letstalk.com/unsubscribe.htm>. 

  * What if I need to correct or update my information?   
Once an order has been shipped, your service provider is the point of contact for any corrections that need to be made to your service plan. You may contact Customer Service at [help@letstalk.com](mailto:help@letstalk.com) prior to the status of "shipped" to request changes to your order. 
  * Are sites "Powered by LetsTalk" subject to the same Privacy & Security Standards?  
LetsTalk does host sites for "Co-branded partners" or sites that may appear to belong to another company, but in all cases if we post the "Powered by LetsTalk" logo, the site is hosted by us and all collected customer information is used for the purposes already stated. Please note that order and site traffic information of users who access our site via partner sites are available to the partner for reporting and aggregate purposes.

A recent technological addition to our site is the implementation of "web beacons" or "image tracking" based reporting. This is a simple technology that allows us to include a one pixel image, that contains a tracking code, on our order receipt page that co-branded partners can then use internally to monitor how many of the customers they forwarded to the LetsTalk.com resulted in orders placed. We have these "web beacons" in place for many co-branded and affiliate partners.




Security  
Why shopping with LetsTalk.com is safe.  
LetsTalk.com has implemented multiple levels of web site security to ensure a safe online shopping environment. We use a secure server, have received SSL secure server certification, and practice credit card encryption. 

To date, LetsTalk.com has not received any reports of credit card fraud. 

  * Secure Web Server  
In keeping with the highest standards of safety, LetsTalk.com's secure server protects web pages that request or display a customer's personal information.
  * SSL Secure Server THAWTE Certificate  
LetTalk.com has received a THAWTE Certificate ensuring that a user's order will be completely private and secure. 
  * Encryption  
LetsTalk.com customer credit card information is processed using the highest bit encryption available.

In addition to technical security, we do not sell user information to third parties and only share user's credit information with carriers in order to complete service plan activations. Site traffic and order information are available to the partner for reporting and aggregate purposes only.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, LetsTalk.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at LetsTalk.com while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
