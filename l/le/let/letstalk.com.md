LetsTalk is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

  * What kind of information do we collect?  
We collect information at several stages during your interaction with LetsTalk.com. When you first enter our site, we note your IP address in connection to your shopping cart and to help with administrating the site. As you browse the site, we record your preferences via a cookie so we can serve more targeted information on your next visit. (Learn more about cookies) 

When you buy a product, you give us contact and shipping information (like your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) and credit information like Social Security number, date of birth, credit card and driver's license identification. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to protect you from false purchases made in your name.

  * What if I am reluctant to provide information online?  
Not a problem, you may contact [customer service](https://web.archive.org/about/contact1.htm) and give them your information through email or via the telephone. If you elect not to provide the information necessary for a service contract, you may choose to acquire a pre-paid service agreement.
  * What do you do with the information?   
Your contact and shipping information is given only to the service provider, the manufacturer making the product you purchase, and Federal Express or UPS. Your personal credit information is forwarded only to a third-party credit card approval service to verify your credit card account balance and for your wireless service provider to authorize service credit according to their terms.

Because all we do is provide your information to the service provider, we do not store your information for extended periods of time, so to update your information please contact the service provider directly 

LetsTalk.com uses your information to follow-up on your order and to send you updated information on our company, products and services. Your service provider and manufacturer may also send you similar information.

Our site provides the opportunity to opt-in to receive mailings without purchasing from LetsTalk.com. All promotional newsletters have instructions on how to be removed from our mailing list. Subscribers may also contact us [via email](https://web.archive.org/web/20050630085521id_/http%3A//www.letstalk.com/about/emailsubmit.htm?htId=6). We do not collect email addresses of recipients of newsletters forwarded by LetsTalk.com subscribers. 

If you prefer not to receive correspondence from LetsTalk.com, you may contact [customer service](https://web.archive.org/about/contact1.htm) with your request. If you elect not to receive information from the manufacturer of the product you bought or the service provider you selected, please note that in your correspondence. If you prefer NOT to provide personal information over the internet, please place your order directly through Customer Service. 


Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site, or as required by law. 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, or other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
