When we ask for personal information we promise:

  * To make sure you know why we need it;
  * To ask only for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant information;

  * To let you know if we share it with other organisations to give you better public services - and if you can say no;

  * Not to make your personal information available for commercial use without your permission.
