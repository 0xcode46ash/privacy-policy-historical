# Privacy Policy - Legacy Games

##### INFORMATION ABOUT YOU  
(Information Gathered From All Visitors)

###### Aggregate Data

We gather certain generic information with respect to customers' use of our web site, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web site that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our web site, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our customers collectively use our web site to advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business ("Business Partners"). We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the site in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.

###### Cookies

We use a technology nicknamed "cookies" on our web site. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to make your visit to our web site easier. Cookies allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on our web site if you choose not to accept cookies, such as favorites. In addition, you will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes or contests. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.

###### Third Party Advertiser Cookies

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and Clear Gif technology (aka 1x1 Pixel .gifs, Web bugs) to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Legacy Games does not use or have access to this information.

If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the web site of the National Advertising Initiative ("NAI") to opt-out of all network-advertising cookies. This site will also allow you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.

###### When You Send an Email from our Site

If you use our web site to send an email, we collect your e-mail address and your recipient's e-mail address. This information is necessary to send the content and provide confirmation that it has been received. We will not use your recipient's e-mail address for any purpose other than to send the message. We may use your e-mail address to contact you if you have chosen to receive communications from Legacy Games. (See Opt-Out/Changing Your Status, below).

###### Personalizing Your Experience on the Web Site

We examine customer traffic patterns and web site usage to help us enhance the design and layout of the site and make it easier to navigate.

From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gage user interest in new products and premiums we may offer. We will ask for your feedback on games and site features. We will use the information we gather to improve our site and provide a more meaningful experience for our users. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you have expressed an interest.

###### Communications from Legacy Games

We send to all of our users our exclusive Legacy Games Newsletter, which alerts you to new games available on our site. Users can sign up for the newsletter from our home page by providing their e-mail address. This information will not be shared with third parties. Information on how to unsubscribe is included in every newsletter. From time to time, we will also send you invitations to enhance your Legacy Games subscription, offers for new products and services from Legacy Games, special "Members Only" premiums, or special offers from our affiliates and sponsors. These communications are sent to you directly by Legacy Games. We do not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties in connection with the Newsletter.

###### Communications from Our Business Partners

If you choose to learn more about a particular game, Legacy may send you to a business partner's site, e.g., Big Fish Games. When you sign up for game related e-mail alerts, you are actually entering your information directly with www.bigfishgames.com so that they can provide you with the requested service. Legacy Games is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. Legacy Games encourages its users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

###### Mandatory Communications

Legacy Games reserves the right to communicate with you from time to time about important administrative, policy, legal, credit card, and billing matters, which will affect your use of our web sites, including without limitation any alleged violations of our Terms of Service. These communications are mandatory.

##### LEGACY GAMES' USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

###### If you have provided us your consent, we will use the information we have collected about you in five ways:

  * * To send personalized, targeted information that we think our users will find relevant, either from Legacy Games or directly from its Business Partners;
  * * To include targeted advertising within such messages;
  * * To send promotions and coupons based on the user's interests;
  * * To contact the user for feedback and surveys; and
  * * To send the user other information about Legacy Games.



###### Order Fulfillment

You are given the opportunity to order products directly on the Legacy Games site, the Newsletters, or in other communications you may receive from Legacy Games. These orders may be fulfilled by Legacy Games or by Legacy Games' Business Partners directly. In accepting these offers, you become a customer of the Business Partner and therefore subject to its privacy policy. We encourage you to review these companies' privacy policies and only do business with those who adhere to personal information practices with which you are comfortable.

##### YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

###### Opt-Out/Changing Your Status

At any time, you can change choices you have previously made as to the use of your personal information. Every communication Legacy Games sends you will contain a clearly worded "Opt-Out" or "Unsubscribe" link allowing you to withdraw your permission for future mailings. This system is automated and must be contacted from the email address you wish to have removed. Permission changes will be honored as soon as possible after receipt. Please allow five to seven days for processing. Permission changes will however not affect any information which you provided to us and which we previously shared with our Business Partners.

##### OTHER MATTERS

###### Protection For Children - COPPA Complianc

We are committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online. We believe that children should be able to use the Internet in a safe, productive, and efficient manner and should be afforded the highest protection available with respect to their personal information. To that end, we have made it our policy to not collect any individually identifiable information from users whom we know are under the age of 13.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") imposes certain requirements upon web sites and online services that are directed toward children. To learn more about COPPA, click here for the Federal Trade Commission COPPA Web Site.

###### Contests and Promotions

Occasionally, Legacy Games may sponsor contests and/or promotions on our sites or in our e-mail products. Participation in such contests is purely voluntary. In order to enter a contest or promotion, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information. By entering, you agree to all of its terms and conditions, which will be clearly outlined in the rules. Where a contest or promotion is not sponsored by Legacy Games, the identity of the sponsor will be clearly disclosed in the rules. Legacy Games cannot be responsible for actions or policies of third-party contest sponsors. Users are encouraged to review the relevant privacy policy of the sponsor before entering.

###### Sale of Assets

In the event that Legacy Games and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right to transfer our user databases together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third-party acquiring Legacy Games's assets. In the event we do so, we will place a prominent notice of the sale on the homepage of our site, with links to information as to how you can change your privacy preferences.

###### Data Security

When you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we use an advanced encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, a lock or key icon appears on the bottom of your web browser.

In addition to our online security efforts, we take steps to protect your personal data offline, as well. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

Legacy Games's main servers are operated from a dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24x7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms.

###### Changes to the Privacy Policy

Legacy Games will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments. Legacy Games encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

##### USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES

Even the best policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages. Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so.

Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children's on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at [customerservice@legacygames.com](mailto:customerservice@legacygames.com).
