# Privacy Policy – Legends of America

**The cliff notes of our Privacy Policy:**

We don’t use your information for spam, nor for anything nefarious. If you ever receive spam from us, please [let us know](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/about-us/#Contact) immediately. Your web browser settings have more control than we do. We don’t sell any information collected. We use [Google Adsense and Google Double Click for Publishers](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) for most of our advertising. These services have their own privacy policies. We use [GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com/legal/privacy.html), a reputable, established company, as our Newsletter provider. This privacy policy pretty much covers everything, but we still have a separate [policy notice on our General Store](https://store.legendsofamerica.com/index.php?l=page_view&p=privacy_policy), as that is where we would collect more than just an email address and name. Our Photo Print Shop is hosted by Zenfolio.com which specializes in showcasing and sales of Photo Prints and other Products. [Zenfolio.com has it’s own privacy policy](https://en.zenfolio.com/privacy).

The rest of this is the legal mumbo jumbo that’s required for us to show you. If you read this entire message, you probably need to find a hobby…just sayin.

**Privacy Policy in full:**

Your privacy is very important to us. At Legends of America we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (Primarily we would ask for your name and email address when signing up for our newsletter. We also require email for making comments on our website.)

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our website, or protect our rights.

We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.

Legends of America operates several websites including Store.LegendsOfAmerica.com, LegendsofAmerica.com, Photos.LegendsofAmerica.com, and LegendsOfKansas.com. It is Legends of America’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. [Legends’ General Store has it’s own privacy policy](https://store.legendsofamerica.com/index.php?l=page_view&p=privacy_policy) due to the fact we gather more information there when you place an order.  Legends’ Photo Print shop is hosted by [Zenfolio.com, which has its own privacy policy](https://en.zenfolio.com/privacy).

From time to time, Legends of America may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
