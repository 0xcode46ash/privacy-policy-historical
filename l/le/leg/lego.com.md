# About us - Privacy Policy

  
| **The LEGO Group On-Line Privacy Policy**

We take children’s interests and needs seriously and our on-line privacy policy reflects this. The LEGO World Wide Web site collects information only for internal purposes. This information will not be shared or sold to any party outside the LEGO Group.

Personal information is collected only during the registration process, contests, and purchases. E-mail addresses are used only to deliver requested information and to notify contest winners.

Non-personal responses collected during a visit are used to help us make sure that our products and our communications to children are responsive to their interests. We hope to be able to continue to make the LEGO Group Web site interesting and entertaining for children, and to ensure that we continue to make the kind of products that children love and parents trust. 

Additional policies for www.LEGO.com visitors: 

  * The LEGO Group encourages families to visit LEGO.com together as a shared activity.   

  * When a guest under 13 signs up on LEGO.com or LEGOMINDSTORMS.com and provides us with an e-mail address, his/her parent or guardian will receive e-mail notification that provides the parent or guardian with instructions on how to remove his/her child’s e-mail address from our mailing list.   

  * Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification will be sent to the parent or guardian’s e-mail address provided by the child when he/she enters the contest.



The LEGO Group reserves the right to change its on-line privacy policy. If important policy changes are implemented, the new policy will be e-mailed to all registered guests at their e-mail address.
