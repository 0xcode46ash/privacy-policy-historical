Your continued use of the website will signify your agreement to any such changes.

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We take reasonable precautions to ensure that any personal information which you provide is used only for the purposes set out in this policy. However, the internet is not a completely secure network and we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by other parties.
