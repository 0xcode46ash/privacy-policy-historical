# The Bluebook - Privacy Policy

### _Effective Date: February 15, 2008_

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. To help you feel secure when visiting [http://www.legalbluebook.com/](http://bluebook.staged.hubbardone.com/) (the “Site”) and using all Site-related services and content, we have adopted the following privacy policy (“Policy”). We reserve the right to change the terms of this Policy at any time by posting the new Policy on the Site.  All changes to the Policy will be effective when posted, and your continued use of the Site after any such revision is posted will be deemed acceptance of such changes.  It is important to review this Policy periodically for the most current version. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact us at [editor@legalbluebook.com](mailto:editor@legalbluebook.com?subject=Bluebook%20Online%20Privacy%20Policy).

## 1\. Collection and Use of Information 

No personally identifiable information will be requested from you if you merely visit the Site. We will only collect personally identifiable information from you when you subscribe to the Site and/or purchase products sold on the Site.

If you subscribe to the Site or make a purchase on the Site, we will ask for your name, email address, credit card information, billing address, shipping address (if applicable) and phone number. This information will be used to process your subscription and/or purchase and, if needed, to contact you about your subscription and/or purchase.

You agree and acknowledge that any request and/or payment made by you for subscriptions, products, or services or other products via the Site may be processed by third parties other than us and, therefore, you expressly consent to our communication and distribution of your personally identifiable information to such third parties. In the event of such communication and distribution, we will require that any third party recipient agree that it cannot use the personally identifiable information in any manner other than to fulfill your request and/or process your payment.

The Site does not track, collect or distribute personally identifiable information about mere visitors to the Site. We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the number of visitors to the Site, the requests we receive for particular information on the Site, and the Internet Service Providers that those requests come from. We use these statistics to adapt and improve the Site to the needs and preferences of our visitors and subscribers.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Policy, we will not share, sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party except when (1) you have been given an opportunity to “opt out” of sharing, selling, or renting such information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided or (2) we legally are required to convey such information, for example in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure.   


We do not seek to collect personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 13.  If we are notified that we have received information from a person under the age of 13, upon verification, we will immediately delete this information from our servers.  Notification may be sent to editor@legalbluebook.com.

4\. Confidentiality and Data Security 

It is our policy that all personally identifiable information requested by the Site, such as your name, billing address, e-mail address or telephone number, will be treated as private and confidential. Any personally identifiable information that you provide to us via the Site is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by our employees, as appropriate, or necessary third parties, and is used only for the purposes for which you provided such information.

The Site employs reasonable procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We sometimes rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware and the processing of payment information. We thoroughly review such third-party’s security procedures and believe that their security procedures are adequate.

The transmission of data or information over the Internet via the Site is not secure and is subject to possible interception, loss or alteration while in transit. While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee complete security, as complete security does not presently exist on the Internet.
