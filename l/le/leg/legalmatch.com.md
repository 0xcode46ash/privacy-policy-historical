In order to achieve the benefits of the LegalMatch service, there are some situations in which personal information may be disclosed to third parties. These are:

* Service related disclosure

This Web site is designed to disclose certain limited information to connect attorneys with the people who need them. The users have full control over when and to whom personally identifying information is disclosed. Our service is designed specifically to keep initial exchanges of information between clients and attorneys anonymous. The limited information we disclose is described below.

* When a user posts a description of his or her legal matter, that information is reviewed only by attorneys and LegalMatch staff. The information is anonymous, meaning that the user's personally identifying information is kept hidden.
* When an attorney responds to a posted matter by making an offer, the offer is seen only by the specific client and subscribing attorneys. The name and contact information of the offering attorney is available only to the specific client.
* The name and contact information of attorneys placing flat fee advertisements will be available to all users. If a user requests an attorney' s contact information, the user' s name and zip code may be revealed to that attorney for the purpose of verifying whether an attorney-client relationship was formed. The attorney is precluded from using this information to contact the user.
* The name of the user posting a rating and commentary for any attorney on this system may be released to that attorney, at the attorney' s request, for the purpose of replying to the rating.
* Information regarding whether an attorney-client relationship was formed will be used only for our internal records and statistics. We will not disclose this information to other parties, unless we are required to do so by law.
* Except for the information referred to above, user' s contact information (i.e. address, telephone, fax, or e-mail) is never revealed to attorneys or other users.
* Partnership Related Disclosure.If you are on a site that is "Partner Site powered by LegalMatch" or whose address is www.partner.legalmatch.com, this means that LegalMatch has a partnership with the Partner Site and that LegalMatch may share some of your registration information with that partner. For people and small business LegalMatch will share only your name, email address and zip code. For attorneys, LegalMatch may also share your firm name, address, telephone number, state of licensure, bar number and areas of practice.

LegalMatch.com may also develop business partnerships with other companies, as part of our service to users. These special business partnerships may include acquisitions by or mergers with other companies or special joint ventures that integrate our Web sites and services.

Whenever LegalMatch shares personally identifying information with a partner, we will do so confidentiality and require use restrictions on the information.

* Legal Related Disclosure.

LegalMatch.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to:

* comply with law
* enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or
* protect the rights, property or safety of LegalMatch.com, our users, or others.
