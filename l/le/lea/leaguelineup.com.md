**LeagueLineup.com Privacy Policy**

LeagueLineup.com has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. LeagueLineup.com feels very strongly that private information should remain private. We will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user's permission. We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please e-mail us by [clicking here](mailto:support@leaguelineup.com).

LEAGUELINEUP.COM GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

**IP Address**  
LeagueLineup.com's Web servers and forms on the Web gather your IP address to help diagnose problems with our service and to administer our site. This information cannot be traced to an individual user. 

**Cookies**  
Our Web site sets cookies to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket, to deliver content specific to your interests, to customize our Web site for you, and to save your password and member name so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit. A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. Your password is stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your Web browser can access LeagueLineup.com as you if you choose to store your member name and password. LeagueLineup.com's Web servers also set a session ID cookie that is used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Session IDs cannot be traced to an individual person or member name, and are analyzed only in aggregate. Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their Web browsers to refuse them; be aware, however, that doing so may prevent certain parts of LeagueLineup.com's site from working (e.g., League and Team sites). Other organizations that place advertising on LeagueLineup.com sometimes have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we do not control. Unless you've saved your member name, cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals (your computer will be assigned a random number); neither LeagueLineup.com nor advertisers will know who you are. 

**Registration Form**  
Membership on LeagueLineup.com is completely optional. LeagueLineup.com's registration form requires users to give contact information (for example, an e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age). On our join form, required fields are marked with an asterisk. We use this information to send members information about LeagueLineup.com (e.g., a newsletter); members may opt out of receiving this information. This information may be used to tailor a member's LeagueLineup.com experience by delivering content specific to his or her interests. 

**Online Surveys**  
At times LeagueLineup.com may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times LeagueLineup.com may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

**Message Boards, Polls, and Community Tools**  
LeagueLineup.com provides many venues for member interaction and community, including message boards, online polls, and other tools. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., message boards) may reveal a user's member name or e-mail address. The aggregate result of polls may be shared on the site.

Users may have the ability to publish certain personal information (e.g., Web page links) on the LeagueLineup.com service. In all cases, users create this information by opting in. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features on LeagueLineup.com.

**Member Feedback**  
LeagueLineup.com stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the LeagueLineup.com service.
