# Annenberg Media: Privacy Policy

| 

Privacy Policy 

**Your Privacy**  
Annenberg Media wishes to protect your privacy on the Web and in all areas where we connect with you. This privacy statement is divided into two parts: first, our general principles, and, second, the detailed actions we take to behave according to those principles. You can think of this second section as the "small print" or "legalese" section. Please feel free to send any questions you may have about this privacy policy to us at info@learner.org.

**Our Principles**

**1\. Your privacy will be protected.**

> Annenberg Media shares no information we receive about you with third parties. This includes both traditional factual information (your name, address, phone number, etc.) and electronic, technical, Web-oriented information (your IPS address, email configuration, email address, etc.) 

**2\. We do not share mailing lists.**

> Annenberg Media does not sell or exchange mailing lists. 

**3\. You will not be spammed.**

> You will only receive email outreach messages from us if you register as a workshop leader, make an inquiry about our work, or request to be placed on a list receiving weekly or monthly updates and news from us through email. 

**4\. We will address your privacy concerns promptly.**

> If you receive our weekly or monthly email news in error, or if you ever wish to discontinue them, or if any other concern related to online interactivity or online ordering arises, please let us know immediately-and we will do our best to solve the problem immediately. 

**Our Actions**

The electronic information our servers collect about visitors depends on what the visitors do while visiting our Web site. 

**1\. If you visit our site to browse, read, download information, or make an order:**

> We collect the IP ("internet protocol") addresses of our site visitors, in order to measure the number and frequency of visitors. This is often referred to as collecting information about "traffic." 
> 
> We use "cookies" on our site in only one way-and our cookies are temporary. If you order our videos or books online, temporary cookies are used for the duration of your session with us. These temporary cookies are sometimes referred to as "session management" cookies. Such temporary cookies allow you to go back and forth between different Web pages without losing the information you supplied at the start of the session. These temporary cookies disappear as soon as you, the visitor, close your Internet browser.

**2\. If you identify yourself personally to us by sending us an email or using an online form to order materials, to register as a workshop site leader, or to subscribe to any of our weekly or monthly email news updates:**

> We store the information you voluntarily provide, and use it to contact you for matters related to the purpose for which you gave it to us. We do not share this information with other organizations or use it for commercial purposes other than those you directly request. If you sign up as a workshop site leader, we may give your work address and email to individual workshop participants who wish to join your site or share your resources. 
> 
> In other limited and exceptional circumstances, we may be required by law to disclose the information you submit. An investigation of credit card fraud would be an example of such circumstances.
> 
> If you use one of our online forms, the information you provide is entirely at your discretion. In the event of a complaint or request from you in the future, it may be impossible for us to refer to, respond to, or investigate your complaint unless you have already shared some information with us through one of our online forms. In other words, if you visit our site anonymously, and leave no footprints behind, we won't be able to help you by retracing any of your steps.

**3\. If you want to retrieve or correct your personal information that may be in our records:**

> We comply happily with the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 to provide you certain rights to view your personal information maintained in our records. Upon request we will provide you with access to your contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number), and offer you the chance to correct inaccuracies.

**4\. If you would like to opt out of our mailings and services:**

> If you do not want to receive email or postal mail from us in the future, please let us know and we will comply. Give us the exact email or postal mail address you would like removed from our lists, and we will do it. 

**5\. A further note about security:**

> If you send us an email message or use one of our online forms, you should be aware that your information is not necessarily secure against electronic interception by unknown and unforeseeable third parties, commonly known as "hackers." If you believe your communication to us includes sensitive information, please contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than by email. 
> 
> Once your information has been collected in our database, we have appropriate security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you.

**6\. In the event of changes to this policy:**

> We reserve the right to use site visitor information in the future for new, unanticipated uses not disclosed in this privacy notice. This is not because we foresee any change in our principles, but because ongoing advances in electronic interactivity may change the very ways you and we connect. Such changes are impossible to foresee. In any case, if our electronic information practices change in these ways, we will post such policy changes on our Web site. You will then have, as you do now, the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, check back at our Web site periodically.
