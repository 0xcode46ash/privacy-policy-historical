# privacy - LearnCore

  
VLinks Media, LLC doing business as LearnCore ("LearnCore" or "We") knows that you care about how the information we receive from and about you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. LearnCore has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. “You” or a “user” refers to any individual who visits a LearnCore website, web service or otherwise uses a LearnCore service. 

  
By accessing the LearnCore website at www.learncore.com, and subdomains of learncore.com, including all related pages ("Site"), including any subscription based features or services offered by LearnCore through the Site or through app.learncore.com (collectively, the "Service"), you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Statement. 

  
**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

  
This Statement covers LearnCore’s collection and use of personal information and non-personal information that LearnCore gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the LearnCore Learning Automation Software Service (the “Service”). “Personal information” is information that identifies you on an individual basis, such as information that would permit a third party to contact you: this would include, for instance, full name and address, household address, telephone number, or email address. “Non-personal information” is information that cannot, when ordinarily read or compiled, be used to identify you on an individual basis: this might include, for instance, a browser or device identifier, or de-identified or anonymized information related connected to those identifiers or your activities; it might also include, for instance, information that has been aggregated or coded to remove personal information. 

  
This Statement does not, however, apply to the practices of third parties that LearnCore does not own or control, or to individuals that LearnCore does not employ or manage. This Statement also does not apply to any third party information gathered by subscribers to LearnCore’s Service (i.e., information about customers of LearnCore subscribers) and submitted by them to the Service for use in connection with their marketing campaigns and other promotional activities ("Customer Data"). LearnCore will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Service Agreement or as may be required by law. 

  
**What Personal Information About Customers Does LearnCore Collect?**

  
Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our customers: 

  
**Information You Provide to Us:**

  
LearnCore collects identifying information when you use the Service, when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any learncore.com web pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we require customers who register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Service. When you initially express interest in obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or company information such as annual revenues or marketing spend. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords. 

  
All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used by LearnCore for marketing or promotional purposes. LearnCore may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing. 

  
Other personal information we collect, as described above, may be used by LearnCore to provide the Service to you, to advertise or market our business, promotions, or services, keep and maintain accounts, keep records of transactions, and for financial management of our business and performing the Service Agreement. Thus, for instance, if you provide us with your email address, we may send you emails (which you may unsubscribe from) informing you about LearnCore services, products, offers and partnerships. See the Section titled “Email Communications” below, for more information about how and why we may email you. If you are a registered user of LearnCore's subscription-based Service, please note that some information about you may remain in our records after the end of your trial or subscription. 

  
**Automatic Information:**

  
When you visit the Site, LearnCore collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, LearnCore uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which you navigate LearnCore’s Site. In addition, we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via our Site, including what pages you visit and activities you perform on our Site. LearnCore automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, LearnCore cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other site registrants. LearnCore uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Service. We may also use any data we collect on or through the Site to better understand and market to our customers or website users, individually or in the aggregate. 

  
We automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and use of components of our Service. We may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to determine how often customers use parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site and Service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. 

  
We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of LearnCore’s subscription-based Service, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about the Service or other users, your account activity, or communications we have had with you. 

  
**E-mail Communications:**

  
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from LearnCore and may use this information to help us customize the emails we send to you, and enhance their relevance to you. We may also send out emails with information regarding LearnCore or our partners including promotions and events. If you complete the request form on the Site for additional information about the Service, we may use your email address to send you information regarding LearnCore, our products and services and our partners and partnerships. You may opt out of being contacted by us by sending an email to hello@learncore.com or by unsubscribing through the unsubscribe or opt-out link in an email. 

  
If a user elects to use our referral features for informing a friend about our Site or Service, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. You agree that you have the required consent to disclose your friend’s name and email address to us for this purpose. LearnCore will automatically send the friend an email on behalf of the user who made the referral, inviting such friend to visit the Site and try the Service. LearnCore does not store this information. 

  
We may use third party service providers to assist us in any of the above email and marketing functions, but when we do so, we require those providers to enter into confidentiality agreements, or otherwise agree to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information we receive from you. 

  
**Information From Other Sources:**

  
In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers and services to you, we may obtain information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. 

  
**Information That You Post on our Site:**

  
Our site may provide you with opportunities to post comments and identifying information, such as to our LearnCore Blog, at http://learncore.com/blog. When you post to the blog, this information may appear in public ways, such as through search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. Please do not post any information that you are not comfortable revealing to the public at large.
