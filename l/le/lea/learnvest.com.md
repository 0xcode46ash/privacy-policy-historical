# Privacy Policy | LearnVest

## About

 _Last Revised: June 29, 2018_

This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes how LearnVest, Inc. (“We”, “Us”, “Our”, or “LearnVest”) accesses, collects, shares and uses personal information through use of the learnvest.com website (collectively, the “Website”).

This Website provides information about financial planning for consumers and does not sell products or services. Through this Website, We gather information that helps Us protect Website users, maintain the security of Our Website, and for the purposes described below.

## Collection of Information

The Website gathers two types of information about people who visit Our Website (“Users”):

  1.  _Voluntary User Information:_ information and data a User provides voluntarily and knowingly, including information and data a User submits on or through the Website; and
  2.  _Automatically Collected Information:_ tracking information, including (but not limited to) IP address and home server information.



LearnVest does not sell User information to third parties. This Website does not enable unaffiliated third parties to collect personally identifiable information about a User’s online activities over time and across different websites when a consumer visits this Website.

## Voluntary User Information

We generally collect information a User provides voluntarily and knowingly to the Website. LearnVest uses information (1) for the purpose it was submitted by the User, (2) to better the functionality and features in the Website, and (3) to provide aggregate statistics to LearnVest about usage of the Website. LearnVest may share User-submitted information with LearnVest’s direct and indirect subsidiaries and third parties only to the extent necessary to service the User’s request, provide assistance to the User, or as described herein or otherwise permitted or required by law.

Certain content on Our Website is accessible after a User enters the User’s e-mail address. The User receives access to the full content after the e-mail address is successfully submitted. The information entered will be collected and used for internal purposes and to sign up for LearnVest’s email newsletter, if the User consents.

Information you voluntarily enter into the Website may also be stored temporarily on your personal device to enhance your use of the Website.

## Automatically Collected Information

We collect information automatically from Our Website through a variety of technologies, including cookies and web beacons. The Website does not contain any functionality to respond to or honor Web browser "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms, and thus does not respond to or honor such signals or mechanisms. Most web browser preferences can be adjusted to alert a User that a cookie or tracking code will be sent to a User’s hard drive, or a User can refuse to receive a cookie.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

This Website collects or receives information including (but not limited to) the IP address, device type, date and time of visit, browser type, and activities of a User.

A cookie is a small text file that is sent to a browser when a User accesses the Website. The Website does not require a User to use cookies, but it is possible that certain features may not function properly if a User chooses to refuse to receive a cookie. We use session cookies to ensure better performance and a more enjoyable and consistent User experience from a User’s entry point into the Website. The session cookie is available only during the course of the browser session; the information is not sent to or stored on a device’s hard drive. Closing the browser or logging off will invalidate the session cookie. We also use machine cookies, which do remain on a computer hard drive, to gather aggregated, non-identifiable website statistics through the website analytic services. No personal information is collected using this technology.

### Tracking Information

To enable Us to continually improve on the content We offer Our Users, as well as for systems administration purposes, We collect aggregate information. This gives Us an idea of which parts of Our Website Users are visiting. We also capture IP addresses to track a User's activity on the Website.

### Hyperlinks

Our Online Privacy Statement applies solely to Our Website. The Website may contain links to other Internet websites. LearnVest is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these other websites, and these links do not imply an affiliation between LearnVest and the website owner, or any endorsement, approval or verification of any content contained on other websites. The online privacy statement of any other Internet website governs information about the handling of personal information by that website.

## Changes and Revisions

We reserve the right to amend this Statement from time to time. Any material change to Our online privacy practices will be reflected in this Online Privacy Statement. We will indicate the date this Statement was last updated.
