# Policies Privacy

LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc., and its affiliates (collectively LeapFrog) is committed to preserving your privacy. From time to time, we may update this policy to improve or clarify our privacy efforts.

The people who bring LeapFrog® products to life are passionate about education and dedicated to enriching the lives of children and adults through learning. Because we believe that learning and personal development are best achieved in an atmosphere of fun and safety, your confidence in our products and conduct is essential to our aspirations. The following sections set forth policies designed to provide assurance to our customers, and to be the foundation of their trust. 

### Collection of Information

It is possible to access much of our Web site without providing any personally identifiable information with the exception of purchasing products and services from our online store. 

However, LeapFrog may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you: (1) register with us; (2) sign up for a newsletter; (3) shop at our online store; (4) participate in contests, events or promotions; (5) send a wish list to a friend or family member; (6) send questions or comments via e-mail to LeapFrog customer support; and/or, (7) fill out online surveys. The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, home address, and (if you purchase products) credit card and billing information. For some activities, we may also ask you to create a password and to provide demographic information such as your age, the gender and birthdates of children in your household, and toy and game ownership and preferences. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. This allows us to tailor the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your preferences and interests. 

### Registration

If you wish to register with one of our sites or register a LeapFrog product, you may be asked to supply personal information such as your full name, e-mail address, and (in the case of product registration) mailing address. We may also ask you to provide demographic information such as your birthdate, gender, the birthdates and genders of children in your household, the postal code and country in which you live, and information on products you own or of interest to you. LeapFrog uses such information to periodically contact you with product information news, special offers and relevant announcements (including service announcements) and to provide other exclusive benefits to those who register their products on our sites. 

### On-line purchases

When you purchase products from our online store, and with your consent at the time of purchase, LeapFrog may provide your information to outside companies that offer products or services that may be of interest to you if you are a teenager (18 or over) or an adult. Except as described in this policy, we never share personal information that we receive online from children under 13 with other companies outside the LeapFrog family of companies. We will remove your name from any list we provide to outside companies, if you contact us: Support. Please note in the subject line Online Purchase. 

In special circumstances, LeapFrog may give other companies access to our information database, but only if necessary to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services to LeapFrog. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see. If LeapFrog believes that anyone's behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request. 

### Contests, Events, Promotions, Questions or Comments, Online Surveys, and Other Uses

We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you provide such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest winners, or if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the order. Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also e-mail or mail you to provide information on upcoming LeapFrog products, web site updates and promotions. 

We may also use data related to your use patterns and your personal preferences to improve the online experience for you and for others. For example, if multiple users experience the same problem on the Web site, we will use this data to improve the site experience. Most of this type of data is analyzed in aggregate form; that is, we cannot identify your data and you are anonymous. It is our intention not to share your individual derived data with anybody, although we may use the analyzed or aggregate data for legitimate business purposes. You have the right to an explanation of what data is being collected, what parties use it, and what it is used for while it is under our control. We will provide that information upon request. Please contact us: Support should you wish to request this information. 

You may change all personal information that you provide to us, such as your name, address and email address, and your membership information at anytime. This information will be available only to you, unless consent has been provided for other use, our Consumer Service representatives and LeapFrog-affiliated third parties, who are contractually committed not to share it further, other than as necessary to process your order or offer services to you. If LeapFrog is sold or transfers its assets, your information may be shared with the receiving party. To protect your privacy, access to this information is protected by a user name and password. User names must be unique, and we make them available on a first-come-first-served basis. For security purposes, some account information will not be available to you online and can be accessed only through a LeapFrog Consumer Service representative. 

### Resumes and Online Job Applications

Please be advised that in some areas of our Web site, you may be able to submit information about yourself in a business capacity. These areas may include a career section where you can submit a resume or job application online. Although any personal information gathered in this context is used exclusively for its intended purpose (e.g., a resume will be used for the job application process only), such information is not otherwise subject to the terms of this privacy policy. 

### Opt-out

If you do not want LeapFrog to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from LeapFrog's e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link included with LeapFrog e-mail or by contacting us: Support. 

### Use of Information

We ask for data that helps us personalize the experience for you and your family on our Web site and within our Internet-enabled products. LeapFrog takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of unauthorized information to anyone other than LeapFrog and its affiliates. 

Regarding the use of ?cookies? on your computer: Our services may require the use of cookies. A cookie is a piece of information exchanged between your browser and our server. The file contains only basic non-identifying information and does not contain any secure information. When you sign in, our Web server reads this information and uses it to identify you during your site session. This eliminates the necessity for you to sign in on every page of our Web site. Cookies also allow for faster access to pages that you may have already have visited. If you turn off cookies in your browser, you may not be able to use some of the personalization in your My LeapFrog area, and certain areas may require you to re-authenticate (sign in) to perform a task. 

LeapFrog does not collect information passively through cookies or other tracking mechanisms except in the circumstances described above. Cookies DON'T contain any personal information about a specific user. We don't use cookies or other non-consensual methods to take personally identifiable or online contact information about you or your family off of your computer. Except for certain activities, which we talked about above, LeapFrog doesn't use cookies for direct marketing or promotional purposes. Cookies are also not used to collect information specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties. 

Use of email addresses: LeapFrog uses adult email addresses for identification purposes. We may require that adult members provide us with an identifying email address in case we need to contact you for parental consent, account activity, or for important Consumer Service messages about your LeapFrog® products. We may disclose your email address to LeapFrog-affiliated third parties who need it to assist us in providing services to our customers. On occasion, LeapFrog may direct third parties to send email or postal mail to you regarding LeapFrog. You have the choice to opt out of promotional mailings. If you request that we not send you email messages, we may not be able to provide certain services, such as notifying you that new downloadable activity packs are available for your LeapFrog® products. If your email address changes, make sure you update your membership information in the My LeapFrog area of the site. If you opt out of promotional emails, LeapFrog may still send emails regarding your account, the status of the site or important product information including, but not limited to, recalls. 

### Security

Firewalls: Some services may not be available if your access to the Internet is filtered by a firewall or proxy server. 

Encryption: Encrypted connections may be required for use of some of our services, especially online product ordering and the examination of personal data. We may encrypt some of our data during transmission to or from your computer, and we will generally not inform you if we use such additional encryption. 

Spam protection: LeapFrog seeks to avoid sending unsolicited bulk email (spam). LeapFrog sends email messages to customers who have provided us with their email address and have elected to receive promotional mailings. If you opt out of promotion emails, LeapFrog may still send email messages regarding your account, the status of the site or important toy information, including recalls. 

Your email address: If you terminate a particular address, it is possible that a third party could adopt the same address. In such cases, messages directed via email to you may be received by unauthorized parties (just as if you moved from one home to another and mail was delivered to your old address). If you then asked us for an email confirmation of your password, it would be sent to the person who adopted your address. You are responsible for notifying us of your new address if you terminate or change email accounts. If you do not notify us promptly of your termination of an email address, we assume no liability for any resulting misdirected messages, which could reveal your personal information, including possibly your account password, to third parties. 

Credit/payment information: We deem your use of a credit card to order goods online as consent to collect information needed to process that order. However, we avoid storing your credit card information, other than as necessary to process your order. 

Data Access: You have the right to view the information you give us, though you may have to call our Consumer Service center and properly identify yourself to do so. You have full control over your information. 

### Children's Privacy Policy

The LeapFrog Web site meets the guidelines of COPPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection. 

LeapFrog's goal is to provide a safe environment that promotes education, entertainment and communication for families. Federal law requires, and it is LeapFrog's policy to require, that children under the age of 13 have parental consent in order to use some portions of this Web site. LeapFrog policy requires that children under the age of 13 have parental consent before they provide information to LeapFrog. LeapFrog does not allow children under the age of 18 to purchase products via our website. LeapFrog provides children with educational products and activities and its Web site provides complementary Web-based activities and product support. 

From time to time, certain activities available on our Web site (such as send-to-a-friend and certain contests or promotions) may allow all users, including children under the age of 13, to disclose a limited amount of personal information to us without requiring prior parental consent. This information is collected to facilitate a one-time communication or service, and is not retained by LeapFrog. 

LeapFrog also may provide links to other complementary sites, but makes no representation or guarantee with respect to materials on or content of other Web sites that you may reach directly or indirectly from our Web site. We encourage you to discuss with your children the responsibilities of using the Internet and the World Wide Web, and suggest that you consider using access-control software to limit or guide your children's exposure to Web-based experiences. For more information, please see our Internet Safety Guidelines. 

As a matter of policy, for children age 13 and under we attempt to avoid: Collecting online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information. 

Collecting personally identifiable offline contact information without prior parental consent. 

Distributing personally identifiable information to third parties except LeapFrog-affiliated third parties who need it to assist us in providing services to our customers. 

Offering children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. 

Soliciting from the child, by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, more information than is needed to participate in the activity. 

Bad language appearing on our site. If you find bad language on our Web site, please inform us by contacting us: Support, so we can take appropriate actions. 

For further information and recommendations about safe Web surfing for children, please review our Internet Safety Guidelines. 

### Parental Control of Online Information

Convenient access to detailed learning progress reports is one of the primary services that LeapFrog.com offers to parents. LeapFrog recognizes that parents' control of such information is of paramount concern to them. 

Our policy is not to admit any child under the age of 13 to LeapFrog's online club (the Never-Ending Learning club) without parental approval. An adult primary parent or guardian must create the LeapFrog family account and add the child to that account. We intend that information related to that child is not accessible to anyone except the primary adult. 

Our goal is to design our site so that the only primary adult account holders are enabled to set information access permissions for others in the family. They may add to or edit any information about children in their LeapFrog family. They may add more children to their family account, or add other trusted adults who wish to be involved in the child's educational process. They can choose to allow those other adults to view the child's detailed progress reports, or restrict them from doing so. Any adult who wishes to be added to a LeapFrog family account must first register with the site. Within reasonable parameters, only the primary account holder is empowered to remove account members.

### Internet Safety

LeapFrog is dedicated to providing a trusted and secure educational environment for families. Privacy and safety are very important to us, and to that end we would like to provide some guidelines and suggestions for safe Web surfing. Parents: we encourage you to discuss with your children the responsibilities of using the Internet and the World Wide Web, and suggest that you may want to consider using access-control software to limit or guide your children's exposure to Web-based experiences. Here are our suggestions to children: 

  1. Keep your passwords private. Do not give them out to anyone but your parents or guardian-not even your best friends. Your online service should not ask for them and neither should anyone else.
  2. Never give out your full name, phone number, address, or where you go to school on the Internet. Don't share photos of yourself, your family, or your home with people you meet online. Always check with your parents before you give information online.
  3. Do not open or accept emails, files, URLs (Web addresses), or other things from people you do not know or trust. Always delete unknown email attachments without opening them. They can contain destructive computer viruses.
  4. If you see something, or if a person sends you anything that makes you uncomfortable, upsets you or offends you, don't respond. Log off and tell your parents or another trusted adult.
  5. Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Don't meet with someone you have met online unless your parents go with you or you have their permission to go alone. Always meet in a public place.
  6. When in doubt, always ask your parents for help, and just LOG OFF when you're not sure! You can always go back online later. Have fun and explore!
