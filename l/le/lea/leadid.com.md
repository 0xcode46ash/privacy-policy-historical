# View LeadiD's Privacy Policy | LeadiD

Welcome to [www.leadid.com](http://www.leadid.com/) (the "Site"), a website owned and controlled by Lead Intelligence, Inc. ("Lead Intel", "we", "us", or "our"). We operate the Site and Lead Intel software products and services made available through the Site (collectively the "Services"), as well as our platform (the "LeadiD Platform"), all of which allow for creation of a unique lead identifier ("LeadiD") to be created for each unique online or software event (“Event” or “Events”), as well as capabilities to audit LeadiDs, in real-time or in batch. We provide this privacy policy to let you know what information we collect and how we use it, share it, and protect it.

## Scope

As a general rule, there are these categories of users of the Site and Services, and some users may belong to more than one category:

  * "Publishers" who are individuals or organizations who are accessing and using the LeadiD Platform to create LeadiDs (collectively the "Publisher Sites"), and 
  * "LeadiD Auditors" and "LeadiD Pre-Auditors" who are individuals or organizations who are accessing and using the LeadiD Platform to query LeadiDs, and related lead information, against a set of rules, flags and/or actions (these rules, flags and/or actions are defined as a "LeadiD Audit").  The LeadiD Audit's rules, flags and/or actions are predefined by the owner of the LeadiD Audit.  LeadiD Audit owners may authorize other parties to query their LeadiD Audits.  Parties who query their own LeadiD Audits are referred to as LeadiD Auditors; Parties who query a LeadiD Audit that another party owns are referred to as LeadiD Pre-Auditors.  For the sake of simplicity, we may use LeadiD Auditors to refer to any party who queries a LeadiD Audit, regardless of whether or not the querying party owns that particular LeadiD Audit. 



There are also individuals who may visit the Site and/or who may visit Publisher Sites and enter information into forms on those sites ("End Users").

This Privacy Policy applies to data that may be volunteered by End Users of Publisher Sites and also applies in some cases to Publishers and LeadiD Auditors. By visiting the Site or utilizing the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Privacy Practices for Visitors to LeadiD.com Site 

  1. The information we gather and how we use it: The Site is primarily directed to Publishers, LeadiD Auditors and LeadiD Pre-Auditors, although we welcome End Users who want to know more about our Services. When you access the Site, we may collect information that may be used to identify or locate an individual, like a person’s full name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, Facebook ID, Twitter ID, or billing information, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this information (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). We will not collect PII except when you knowingly provide it, including when you register for the Site, provide feedback, or request information. We use your PII to administer your account and provide you services, to send communications and administrative emails, to respond to your inquiries, and to send marketing and product update messages to those who ask for such messages. Typically, Publishers and LeadiD Auditors, rather than End Users, visit the Site in order to access and register for the Services. For example, Publishers may provide their email address when they register on the Site and create a user name and password.
  2. Controlling our use of your PII: If you have provided PII such as your email address when registering for our Site, you may modify that information at any time by visiting your account settings (<http://app.leadid.com/users/edit>). While we would be sorry to see you go, you can delete your account at any time. You can opt out of receiving certain email communications from the Site by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email, or similar opt out links may be provided.
  3. Information Sharing: We share PII collected via the Site with other companies or individuals as follows: 
    * With third parties if we have a good faith belief that access, use, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or an enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Use of the Services, including but not limited to investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Lead Intel, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law. 
    * In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your PII may be among the assets transferred. 
    * Within the use of the LeadiD Audit service, some of the requested information may include PII that is associated with the information within your account, such as your company's name. 



##  Privacy Practices for End Users Who Visit Publisher Sites that have Services Installed

We operate the Services, as well as the “LeadiD Platform”, all of which allow for a unique LeadiD to be created for each unique online form event, as well as capabilities to query LeadiDs, in real-time or in batch. When you, an End User, enter information into a form on a Publisher Site, the Services that have been installed on the Publisher Site automatically create and return to the Publisher a LeadiD. We associate certain non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) automatically for use on the LeadiD Platform. Certain LeadiD Services capture data that you, an End User, enter into a form on a Publisher Site. In these cases, any personally identifiable information (“PII”) that an End User volunteers is encrypted using a Cryptographic hash function which makes it infeasible for anyone, including us, to store, retrieve, reverse-engineer, or utilize the PII that was volunteered by the End User. We enable LeadiD Auditors, as well as Publishers, to use this Non-PII information via the LeadiD Platform for analytics purposes, as described below.

The information we gather and how we use it:

  1. PII:  We will not store PII that is volunteered by End Users on a Publisher’s Site. As described above, any PII that is entered by an End User on a Publisher’s site who is utilizing LeadiD Services, will not be stored as PII, and may only be stored as Non-PII in the form of encrypted values.
  2. Non-PII:  We collect Non-PII through the provision of Services for use on the LeadiD Platform. For example, when you visit a Publisher Site, our server logs may collect your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time that that web page was visited, as well as other Non-PII.
  3. Controlling our use of your Non-PII: If you don't want us to store your Non-PII, you can opt-out by not filling out online forms that utilize the Services.
  4. Information Sharing: We share Non-PII with other companies or individuals as follows: 
    * To enable us to provide our Services to LeadiD Auditors who wish to certify that an Event took place in which an End User legitimately participated, as well as other associated information, including but not limited to when, where, and by whom that Event took place. 
    * We share any information we have with third parties if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or an enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce the applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Lead Intel, its End Users, or the public as required or permitted by law. 
    * In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we expect that any and all information that we have will be among the assets transferred. 
    * In addition, we may aggregate your Non-PII with the Non-PII of others and share that aggregated information with third parties without restriction. 




## Information Security and Retention

We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems.

We restrict access to PII to Lead Intel employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.

We retain individual records of PII and Non-PII indefinitely, with End User PII remaining in its encrypted format, as described herein.

## Children

We do not knowingly collect or maintain PII from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's PII from our databases.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Site and Services provide services to third party websites and services. The fact that we provide services to these entities is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This privacy policy applies only as provided in the "Scope" section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit and especially those where you provide your PII to them.

## International Users

The Site and Services are hosted in the United States. If you access the Site or Services from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site or Services, you are transferring your PII to the United States and you consent to that transfer. Additionally, you understand that your PII may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing PII may be less stringent than in your country.
