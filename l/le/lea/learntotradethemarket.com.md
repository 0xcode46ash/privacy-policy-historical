At LTTTM, we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of the personal information supplied by individuals. LTTTM is bound by the National Privacy Principles (‘NPPs’) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’). LTTTM has appointed a Privacy Officer, who oversees the Privacy Policy, and ensures that LTTTM’s management of personal information is in accordance with this Policy and with the Privacy Act.

Typically, the type of personal information we collect about the individual includes his or her name, age, date of birth, occupation, mailing address, phone numbers, email address and other information that is relevant to the products and services we provide.

The personal information may also include information about the form of identification used in relation to an individual to send or receive a transaction (required by law in some instances), and information about a transaction in relation to an individual, including details of the amounts paid in or out of an individual’s account as well as delivery instructions.
