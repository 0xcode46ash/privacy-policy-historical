# Privacy Policy - Leadin

Last Modified: March 9, 2015

We at HubSpot (HubSpot, Inc. and our affiliates, including Leadin) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our leadin.com website (Website) and your use of our installable Leadin WordPress plugin (Plugin). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using the Website or the Plugin, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or Plugin.  
We periodically update this Privacy Policy. If you have the Plugin installed on your WordPress.org site, you will receive notice when this Privacy Policy is modified. The notice will be delivered to the email address we collected when you installed the Plugin. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy Periodically.

### 1\. Important Information

**1.1. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Website and, if you have the Plugin installed on your WordPress.org site, providing notice to the email address we have collected when you installed the Plugin. This helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Website, Plugin, and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

**1.2. Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our treatment of the information you provide us, please write to us by email at privacy@hubspot.com or by mail to HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA, Attn: Privacy.

### 2\. Use of the Plugin

**2.1. The Plugin**

Our Plugin allows users to keep track of visitors to their websites, including information those visitors submit via forms on their websites. This information, which is stored and managed on our users’ own servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the company’s goods or services and interact with the company. We provide the Plugin to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Website for our own marketing and lead generation.

**2.2. Use by HubSpot**

We use our own Plugin to track visitors to our Website. Information that we collect and manage using the Plugin for our own marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.

**2.3. Use by our Customers**

Our customers use the Plugin to keep track of visitors to their websites. We do not control the content of our users’ webpages or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Plugin. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Plugin. We are not responsible for our customers’ use of information they collect in the Plugin.

### 5\. Navigational Information

**5.1. Cookies**

We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Website, or register for the Plugin, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Plugin or Website you visit. HubSpot keeps track of the Website and pages you visit within the Plugin, in order to determine what portion of the Website or Plugin is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Website and Plugin to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

**5.2. Log Files**

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by us for the operation of the Plugin, to maintain quality of the Plugin, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

**5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Plugin by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.

**5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers**

Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages. HubSpot does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.

**5.5. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies**

The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as “Flash cookies.” HubSpot does not use Flash cookies. However, customers of our Plugin may create pages that employ Adobe Flash cookies. HubSpot does not have access or control over our customers’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly. Similarly, our customers may create pages that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons. The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.

**5.6. Third Party Tracking Technologies**

The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies
