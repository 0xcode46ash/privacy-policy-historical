When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you have told them : 

  * which data they must give; 
  * which information is voluntary; and 
  * how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about them.

  * where you heard about us; 
  * if you have done any learning in the last three years. 



We also request other information including your title, middle name, email address,National Insurance number and if you are a Welsh speaker, but you don't have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website, we, or our approved service providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved Level 2 in English and Maths.

Please note that when you enrol on a **learndirect** course that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non-sensitive personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the administration associated with your qualification. 

###  Other information we collect, if you enrol at a learning centre, to see if you can have government funding

When you enrol on a course with a service provider in a **learndirect** centre, the service provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which **learndirect** courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these **learndirect** courses to help us deliver our services to you.  

We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the **learndirect** business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning. 

Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by **learndirect** staff to check the quality of tutor support. **learndirect** staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements. 

###  Referral Partners 

If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we may be required by the referral partner to provide them with updates on the following areas: 

  * Attendance 
  * Progress 
  * Achievement/completion 
  * Outcome/destination 
  * Withdrawal 



###  Job Centre Plus Referrals 

If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.  We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.  You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing. 

When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.  In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from [www.direct.gov.uk.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/ "Direct Gov")

###  Keeping you informed 

We, and our approved service providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about : 

  * our services and materials; 
  * additions to the website; and 
  * specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions. 



If you enrol on a **learndirect** course you will periodically be sent customer feedback surveys. If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes untick the relevant boxes on the 'contact permissions' page. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using 'edit your details' on your learner home page. 

If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on **0800  101 901** or [ email us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query). 

We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes without your express consent. 

###  Funding 

We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the [Skills Funding Agency (SFA)](http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/) in England. The SFA may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the [Welsh Assembly Government](http://www.wales.gov.uk/) for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility. If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved service providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price. 

At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the SFA or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. Please read the SFA Data Protection Statement. 

We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the [Department for Work and Pensions](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/)) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation. 

**SFA Privacy Notice**

The SFA requires that we also tell you about its own privacy notice so that you understand how the SFA will use the information that we give them.  It says: 

**_How We Use Your Personal Information_**

_The personal information you provide is passed to the Chief Executive of Skills Funding (“the Agency”) and, when needed, the Young People’s Learning Agency for England (“the YPLA”) to meet legal duties under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, and for the Agency’s Learning Records Service (LRS) to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN). The information you provide may be shared with other partner organisations for purposes relating to education or training._

_Further information about use of and access to your personal data, and details of partner organisations are available at the[SkillsFundingAgency](http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/privacy.htm), [ypla.gov.uk](http://www.ypla.gov.uk/privacy.htm) and [learningrecordsservice.org](http://www.learningrecordsservice.org.uk/documentlibrary/documents/Code+of+Practice+for+Sharing+of+Personal+Information.htm)._

###  Statistics 

We and/or the approved service providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the [Department for Business, Innovation and Skills](http://www.bis.gov.uk/), in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using **learndirect,** you cannot be personally identified from this information.  
However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether **learndirect** learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled. 

The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information. 

###  Requests for information 

If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so. 

###  Protecting your personal information 

We are registered as a data controller (in our registered company name of Ufi Limited) in line with the UK Data Protection Act, 1998. As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information including your password is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees and sub-contractors can access. All parties with access to your information are subject to confidentiality obligations. If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the "change my password" option under "your details" on your learner home page. 

Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk.
