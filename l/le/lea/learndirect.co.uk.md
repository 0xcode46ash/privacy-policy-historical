### 9\. How does learndirect protect your personal information?

As a registered data controller, **learndirect** is required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of the **learndirect** system and data. **learndirect** implements a number of sophisticated authentication services and security measures to ensure the safety of any personal information it collects. Your account is password protected and all information is contained on a secure server which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have authorised access rights to such information. If your password has been compromised in any way you should immediately notify **learndirect** and change your password. You can change your password at any time using the "change my password" option on the "my details" menu item on your learner home page.

Whilst **learndirect** uses reasonable endeavours to protect your security in the manner described above, **learndirect** considers that it is only appropriate to advise users that data transmission over the Internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure, and therefore that you use the website at your own risk.

Please refer to the [Terms and Conditions](http://www.learndirect.co.uk/terms/ "read our Terms and Conditions") for the **learndirect** policy in relation to purging of emails and webspace and the circumstances in which **learndirect** may deactivate your account and delete all records, files and associated information.

Netbanx will use the information provided by you to refund any monies due to you if you cancel your Enrolment in accordance with the **learndirect** [Terms and Conditions](http://www.learndirect.co.uk/terms/ "read our Terms and Conditions").

### 10\. How long does learndirect keep your personal data ?

Personal data will be retained only for so long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected, as required by law or to enforce or defend legal claims. In some circumstances, we will retain information which you may have deleted, for example, messages sent by you to your tutor, as evidence of your support, achievement or completion of a learning experience. Such information will be retained for a reasonable time.

### 11\. Does learndirect use cookies?

Cookies are small text files which are sent to your browser by a web server and stored on your personal computer's hard disk. The use of cookies has increased dramatically in recent years. **learndirect** uses cookies for several purposes listed below :  


  * to minimise the amount of times you have to type in data. This means, for example, that you will not have to log in for a second time if you want to check your e-mail; 
  * to record the answers that you give to the online questionnaire on the Website about your funding support. This cookie collects the data you enter in your response to the questions asked and stores a record of the answer given by the **learndirect** system. The cookie expires on your computer after 30 minutes and the data is not kept by **learndirect** unless you choose to carry on and buy a course at the reduced price in which case it is passed on automatically to the **learndirect** provider. The cookie still expires after 30 minutes even if you have chosen not to buy a course through the Website;
  * to record responses to banner advertising and to track website usage. These cookies do not collect your personal information and they are used to target our advertising, to track the success of our advertising and to track visitor usage of the **learndirect** website. These cookies are not issued by **learndirect** and may require your browser to connect to sites that are not run by **learndirect** and
  * to track responses to regular customer surveys for **learndirect.** These cookies are used to make sure that you don't see the same customer survey more than once. These cookies are not issued by **learndirect.**



You can always disable cookies via your browser preferences. If you want to know how to do this please look at the 'help' menu on your browser. Most modern browsers have cookies turned on as a default. If you choose to disable cookies you may not be able to use certain **learndirect** features and you may be required to enter your password more frequently. Please remember that cookies cannot read your hard drive or make any information collected by use of a cookie available to any third party. A cookie can only be read by the website of the organisation that set it.

**learndirect** uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These files are not issued by **learndirect** but by an advertising provider. These files enable **learndirect** advertising providers to recognise a unique cookie in your web browser, which in turn enables **learndirect** to learn which advertisements bring customers to our website. These files are anonymous and not personally identifiable.

### 12\. The learndirect policy for children

**learndirect** understands the importance of protecting children's privacy. The Website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. However, **learndirect** believes that ultimately it is the responsibility of parents to supervise children when on-line and **learndirect** recommends that parental control tools be put in place.

No one under the age of 16 will be able to register on-line as a learner or member, and users are advised that government funding for courses is not available to persons under the age of 19.

Information collected from persons under the age of 18 will not be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, as is stated when you register for competitions or promotions.

Although anyone will be able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner's personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or guardian consent during registration.

### 13\. Internet-based Transfers

Given the global nature of the Internet, use of the Internet to collect and process data necessarily involves personal data being transmitted on an international basis. By using the Website and communicating with learndirect electronically, you acknowledge and agree to the processing of your personal data in this way.

### 14\. Your Rights

You have the right to ask for a copy of your information (for which we charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies. You can amend your details on the Website at any time using the "my details" menu item on your learner home page. To obtain a copy of the information we hold about you please ring us on **08000 150 450** or [e-mail us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query).

### 15\. Links

The Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that **learndirect** is not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of this when they leave the **learndirect** Website and to read the privacy statement of each and every website that collects personal information from them.
