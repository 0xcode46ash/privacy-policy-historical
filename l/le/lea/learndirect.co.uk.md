### Third parties and sponsors

To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to give your information to our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course, we will tell you which of our approved learning providers will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following registration and/or enrolment via the website, all of our approved learning providers will have access to your name and contact details to help us deliver our services to you.

We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the **learndirect** business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other group is sponsoring you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.

Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by **learndirect** staff to check the quality of tutor support. **learndirect** staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.

  * our services and materials;
  * additions to the website; and
  * specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.



If you wish to join **learndirect** but do not wish to receive this information, untick the relevant boxes on the 'join us' page (inviting us to contact you by post and for customer feedback purposes). If you do wish to receive information about **learndirect** developments and offers by telephone, email and/or SMS, please invite us to contact you by ticking the appropriate boxes. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using "your details" on your learner home page.

If you have not registered as a member but are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on **08000 150 450** or [e-mail us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query).

We will never use your sensitive data for marketing purposes or to target you for customer feedback purposes without your express consent.

### Funding

We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application you make for funding. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will share the information you supply with the [Learning and Skills Council](http://www.lsc.gov.uk/) in England (who may in turn share it with the European Social Fund), or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the [Department for Employment and Learning](http://www.delni.gov.uk/) in Northern Ireland and the [National Council for Education and Learning Wales](http://www.elwa.ac.uk/). We, or our approved learning providers, may also share it with the [Adult Learning Inspectorate](http://www.ali.gov.uk/) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.

We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the [Department for Work and Pensions](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/)) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course.

### Statistics

We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the [Department for Education and Skills](http://www.dfes.gov.uk/), in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using **learndirect,** you cannot be personally identified from this information.

### Requests for information

If you have not registered as a learner or member but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.

### Protecting your personal information

As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees can access. If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the "change my password" option under "your details" on your learner home page.

Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk.

Please look at the terms and conditions on this website for our policy on purging emails and webspace. The terms and conditions tell you when we may close your account and delete all your records, files and information.

### Keeping your personal data

We keep personal data :

  * for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for;
  * as required by law; or
  * to enforce or defend legal claims.



Sometimes we will keep information that you have deleted, for example messages sent by you to your tutor, as a record of your learning experience. We will keep this information for a reasonable time.
