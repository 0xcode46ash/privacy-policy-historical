Following enrolment via the website, we, or our approved learning providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved Level 2 in English and Maths. 

Please note that when you enrol on a **learndirect** course that leads to qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the administration associated with your qualification.

###  Other information we collect to see if you can have government funding

  * your age; 
  * your education so far; 
  * your citizenship status; and 
  * where you live and how long you have lived there.

###  Third parties and sponsors 

To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to give your information to our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course, we will tell you which of our approved learning providers will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via the website, all of our approved learning providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which **learndirect** courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these **learndirect** courses to help us deliver our services to you. 

We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the **learndirect** business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other group is sponsoring you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning. 

Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by **learndirect** staff to check the quality of tutor support. **learndirect** staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements. 

###  Keeping you informed 

We, and our approved learning providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about : 

  * our services and materials; 
  * additions to the website; and 
  * specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions. 



If you enrol on a **learndirect** course but do not wish to receive this information, untick the relevant boxes on the âcontact permissionsâ page (inviting us to contact you by post and for customer feedback purposes). If you do wish to receive information about **learndirect** developments and offers by telephone, email and/or SMS, please invite us to contact you by ticking the appropriate boxes. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using "your details" on your learner home page. 

If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the "request more information" page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on **08000 Â 101Â 901** or [ email us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query). 

We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes or to target you for customer feedback purposes without your express consent. 

###  Funding 

We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will share the information you supply with the [Learning and Skills Council (LSC)](http://www.lsc.gov.uk/) in England. The LSC may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the [Welsh Assembly Government](http://www.wales.gov.uk/)Â for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the LSC to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved learning providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Childrenâs Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price. 

At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the LSC or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. Please read the [LSC Data Protection Statement](http://www.learndirect.co.uk/home/ilr/lscdpa/)

We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the [Department for Work and Pensions](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/)) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation. 

###  Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) and the Unique Learner Number (ULN) 

The Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) service is operated by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for learners aged 14 years and over and learners registering for relevant post-14 qualifications.Â  MIAP is responsible for the operation of the Learner Registration Service and also the creation of a Learner Record. 

_Learner Registration Service (LRS)_

By enrolling with Ufi, you agree to us providing MIAP with the following personal data so that MIAP can allocate you a Unique Learner Number (ULN): 

  * Given Name 
  * Family Name 
  * Gender 
  * Date of birth 
  * Postcode 
  * Details of how your identity was verified 



The LRS will enable organisations listed in section 537A of the Education Act ([www.miap.gov.uk](http://www.miap.gov.uk/)) to access your ULN and verify the details used to create your ULN, thereby saving you having to supply the same information repeatedly to different organisations.Â 

_Learner Record_

By enrolling with Ufi, you also agree to us providing your participation and achievement data to MIAP so that MIAP can create and maintain a Learner Record.Â Â  Your ULN will enable you to access the Ufi participation and achievement data held in your Learner Record via a website and will allow MIAP to share this data with those organisations listed in section 537A of the Education Act ([www.miap.gov.uk](http://www.miap.gov.uk/)), if you tell Ufi that you are happy for MIAP to do so. You can decide to opt out of MIAP sharing your participation and achievement data at any time and current details of how to do so can be found at [www.miap.gov.uk](http://www.miap.gov.uk/) or by telephoning 0845 6022589. 

MIAP may use and disclose anonymised information pulled from Learner Records for statistical purposes.Â 

Ufi is not responsible for MIAP's privacy practices and you should read about such practices at [www.miap.gov.uk](http://www.miap.gov.uk/). 

###  Statistics 

We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the [Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills](http://www.dius.gov.uk/), in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using **learndirect,** you cannot be personally identified from this information.  
However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether **learndirect** learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled. 

The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information. 

###  Requests for information 

If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.
