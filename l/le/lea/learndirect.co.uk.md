We also request other information including your title, middle name, email address, National Insurance number and if you are a Welsh speaker, but you don’t have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website, we, or our approved service providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning.

If you are already registered on the learndirect community you will use the same user name and password to access your learning.

Please note that when you enrol on a learndirect course that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the administration associated with your qualification.

**Other information we collect, if you enrol in a learning centre, to see if you can have government funding**

**Third parties and sponsors**

To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to share your information and Learner File with our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course with a service provider in a learndirect centre, the service provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which learndirect courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these learndirect courses to help us deliver our services to you.  In a limited number of circumstances it may be necessary to allow a new Service Provider access to all your personal information for example if your existing Service Provider no longer provides learndirect services.

We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the learndirect business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.

Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by learndirect staff to check the quality of tutor support. learndirect staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.

**Referral Partners**

If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we may be required by the referral partner to provide them with updates on the following areas:

  * Attendance
  * Progress
  * Achievement/completion
  * Outcome/destination
  * Withdrawal



**Job Centre Plus Referrals**

If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.  We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.  You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing.  When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.  In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from www.direct.gov.uk.

**Keeping you informed**

We, and our approved service providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about:

  * our services and materials;
  * additions to the website; and
  * specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.



If you enrol on a learndirect course you will periodically be sent customer feedback surveys.  If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes untick the relevant boxes on the ’contact permissions’ page. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using “edit your details” on your learner home page.

If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the “request more information” page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on 0800 101 901 or [email us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query).

We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes without your express consent.

**Funding**

We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the Skills Funding Agency in England. The Skills Funding Agency may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the [Welsh Assembly Government](http://www.wales.gov.uk/) for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility. If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved service providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.

At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the Skills Funding Agency or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. You can change your choices at any time by talking to your tutor.  Please read the SFA Privacy Notice below.

We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the [Department for Work and Pensions](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/)) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.

**SFA Privacy Notice**

The SFA requires that we also tell you about its own privacy notice so that you understand how the SFA will use the information that we give them.  It says:

This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using learndirect, you cannot be personally identified from this information.

However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether learndirect learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled.

The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information.

**Requests for information**

We will not use information collected from people under 18 for marketing purposes. In general, Government funding is not available to learners under 19 via learndirect, although there are some specific exceptions, in particular apprenticeships.  This privacy statement will apply to any learner enrolled on an apprenticeship even if you are aged between 16 and 18.
