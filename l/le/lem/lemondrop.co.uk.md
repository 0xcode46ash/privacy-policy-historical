# AOL UK Privacy

The AOL company name has changed to Oath. The way we handle your information hasn't changed, so the Oath Privacy Policy will continue to govern when you are on previously branded AOL products, services, or technologies, including AOL Mail, AOL.co.uk, HuffPost UK, Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, and Makers.

This notice provides highlights of the [full privacy policy](http://privacy.aol.co.uk/privacy-policy/) and covers the collection and use of information when you use the Oath or HuffPost UK brand websites, services, and software (collectively the "Oath Services") and other content and offerings from Oath (UK) Limited, its subsidiaries and [Affiliates](http://privacy.aol.co.uk/definitions/) (together "Oath") ("Oath", "We" and "Us"), as well as any websites owned by or affiliated with Oath and operating under different names.

### Personal Information

We or data processors acting under our control may collect information which may identify you or your Oath account ("Personal Information") when you make your information known, such as by registering or logging into AOL Mail or the HuffPost UK, authenticating, making purchases, or interacting with other Oath Services.

If you do not make yourself known to us, your use of our content and services is generally anonymous.

### How we use your Information

Your Personal Information is used to operate and improve our services, fulfill your requests and communicate with you, conduct research, and personalise the content and advertisements provided to you.

Our ability to provide the Oath Services depends on advertising, including advertising provided by Oath affiliates such as ONE by AOL advertising services. Some of the adverts on our services are displayed based on the page visited and some are targeted to you based on your interests and other information we have about you. We want you to understand how internet advertising works and offer resources and choices. [Learn more](http://privacy.aol.co.uk/advertising-and-privacy/).
