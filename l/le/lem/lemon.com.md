# Lemon · Privacy Policy

_Effective Date:   June 7, 2012_ ****

**Scope**.  This Privacy Policy applies to users of our Lemon.com website, users of our services and our mobile apps, and recipients of our emails. It describes the personal data that we collect, how we use this data and how we protect this data.  By using our website, services or mobile apps, you are agreeing to our collection and use of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Summary**. **  **If you provide us with your personal data, we make the following commitments to you:

  * we will not spam you; and
  * we will not share your data unless we’ve told you in advance, you’ve given us permission, we’ve aggregated it and removed any information that would identify you, or legal rights are affected.



**Data We Collect When You Visit Our Website**. **    **When you visit our website, we may collect the following data:

  * **_Cookies_**. ** _  _**We use cookies on our website to collect data about your visit and to allow you to navigate from page to page without having to re-register each time.  We may also use this data to tailor advertisements to you.  You can refuse cookies by using the appropriate setting on your browser.  In this case, you may not be able to access portions of our website.
  * **_Analytics_**. ** __** We use third party analysis tools, such as Google Analytics, and collect data about your computer and Internet connection.  That information includes the IP address of your computer and/or Internet service provider, when you access our website, the Internet address of websites from which you link to our website and from which you came before landing on our site, the browser that you are using, and your movements and preferences on our website.  All of this information is used internally for the purpose of understanding how our site is being used and improving our site.
  * **_Action Tags_**. ** _  _**We use action tags (also called pixel tags, clear GIF, or beacons) to identify some of the pages that you visit, and how you use the content on these pages.  Action tags are also placed in advertisements that are served on our behalf by third parties on our website or the websites of other parties.  We also use action tags in our emails, to determine whether an email was opened or whether it was forwarded to someone else.  Action tags may collect and transmit this data in a manner that identifies you personally if you have registered with our website, or are logged into our website.
  * **_Site Management_**. **  **We aggregate data that we collect about the use of our website for administering, protecting and improving our website and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our website visitors and optimize the content that we serve, to identify server problems, to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage, to improve our marketing and research.



**Data We Collect as Part of Our Service**. **** If you use services and mobile apps to store your information, such as payment cards and receipts, we will scan and digitize these for you, store the images and provide you with access to the digitized data through our mobile app and a secure online dashboard on our website.  You are able to download our mobile app using an authorized account (for example, a Google account in the Android Marketplace or an Apple ID in the iTunes store).  You are able to use our mobile app without registering with us, however, you may not have access to many of the features of our app.  If you wish to register with us (either on your mobile phone or our website), you need to create an account using your email address and setting a password and PIN.

As part of our service, we may collect the following information from you:

  * your name and email address;
  * the data displayed in the image you submit, which could include your name, your debit card or credit card data, information from a receipt such as merchant name, address or phone number, date and time of a purchase, the amount and method of payment, and the items purchased; and
  * any description, labels, or tags that you add to your cards or receipts.



We collect this information because it is required in order for us to provide you with our services.  You can see images of your stored data, review the digitized data and tags and search this data.  If you do not want this data collected, you can stop using our services and mobile apps at any time and delete your account. In addition, if you request information from us (for example, through requests for support) we may collect data such as your name, e-mail address and phone number in order to respond to your request.

**How We Use Your Data**. **  **We use your data to provide you our services.  We may share your information with third parties, but it will only be in the following cases:

  * we’ve told you in advance, for example, if we’ve disclosed it in our Privacy Policy;
  * you’ve given us permission, for example, by opting in to receive targeted deals from third parties based on your spending habits such as where you shop, the amount of a purchase or the details of what you purchased;
  * we’ve aggregated it and removed any information that may identify you; or
  * when legal rights are affected.



**How We Protect Your Data**. **  **The security of your data is a top priority for us.  We use reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we obtain about you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  These are a few of the ways we are safeguarding your information:

  * **_SSL and Password Encryption_**.  You log in to your Lemon account in our online dashboard using SSL (secure sockets layer), the standard in Internet security for authentication and encryption.  This encrypts data transmitted between your device and our servers, including passwords.
  * **_PIN-Entry Required for Payment Card Data_**.  We grant you access to the data you store using our mobile apps relating to your credit card or debit card only upon your entry of the PIN number that you select.  That PIN number is not known to us or stored anywhere in our system.  We use your PIN as a key to encrypt your data.  Be sure to select your PIN carefully—because we don’t store your PIN, if you lose or forget it, you will not be able to access you stored payment card data.
  * **_Restricted Access_**.  We protect centralized databases and storage systems by preventing access from the public internet.



Please note that we are not responsible for the security of any data you are transmitting over the internet, or any data you are storing, posting or providing directly to a third party’s website, which is governed by that party’s policies.

**How You Can Update or Delete Your Data**. **  **You can update or delete receipt and payment card data and images by using the edit feature in our mobile app or online dashboard on our website.  If you wish to close your Lemon account altogether or if there is other information that you have provided to us that you wish to change, please let us know by submitting a request to [support@lemonhq.com.](mailto:%73u%70%70%6frt@le%6d%6fnh%71.com.)  Please note that we may retain your personal information in our databases in accordance with our applicable data retention policies and applicable laws.  This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later.  For example, we may need or be required to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity, protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain, or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.  Your personal information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by us.   In all cases, we reserve the right to use data obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate.

**Third Party Service Providers**.  We use third party service providers as part of delivering our service.  These third parties provide us with certain advertising, referral, operations and technology services (such as hosting providers).  We require each service providers to enter into a written agreement with us by which they agree, among other things, to protect the confidentiality and security of your data, and to use your data only on our behalf and only in the way we permit in the written agreement.
