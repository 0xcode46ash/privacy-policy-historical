# Privacy statement

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. You do not have to give any personal or private information about yourself when you visit our website. 

We collect data from our website to help us understand how many people access it, how it is used and whether there have been any technical problems. This doesn’t contain any personal information and we can not link this data to individual visitors. All the information we collect in this way is deleted periodically. The data we collect includes;

  * The name of your internet service provider and the internet protocol (IP) address you are using. This may or may not identify a specific computer.
  * The date and time you visit our website, and the pages you look at.
  * The internet address of any websites which have linked you directly to our site.



We collect personal information only when you specifically and knowingly give it to us, for example by filling out an online form or by sending an email. We record what time you give us this information and keep track of where it is sent to. We will use the personal information you give us for the reasons stated when you provide it. We will only use it for other reasons where we have to legally or where this is allowed by law. Generally we will not share your information with outside parties unless we have to legally or where the law allows this.

**External service providers  
** Leeds City Council occasionally contracts external companies to help provide online services.

  * We only give them the information which they need to carry out the service.
  * They agree not to use any information we give them for any other reason than what we have agreed with them.
  * We make sure they have proper systems in place to protect personal data and private information.



**Security  
** We monitor the data we collect to detect or investigate unauthorised uses of our website. This means that when you send us an email or submit information using an online form we stop it to check what it contains. Please be aware that whilst we do everything we can to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information in an email or an online form whilst this is being transmitted to us.

**Cookies  
** Cookies are files which can be stored on your computer when you visit a website. These files contain information about the web pages you look at so that the next time you visit the site it can be customised to meet your needs. We do not use cookies on this website at present. If we decide to use them in the future, we will include full details in this internet privacy statement, and they will not be associated with any personal information.

**Virus and malware protection  
** We make every effort to check and test the material on our site for malicious software or 'malware'. However, Leeds City Council cannot accept any responsibility or liability for any loss, disruption or damage to your computer system or information contained on it, which may occur as a result of using material from our site. It is always advisable to run an anti-virus program on any material downloaded from the internet.

If an email infected with malicious software is sent to us, it will be deleted automatically before it reaches our email system. Please be aware that if you have unintentionally sent us an email infected with malicious software, it will not reach us. If you don't receive acknowledgement of your email within 10 working days, please contact us using the online enquiry form on the right.

We cannot guarantee that links will work all of the time, and we have no control over the availability of the linked pages on other websites.

Please be aware that other web sites may deal with privacy differently to Leeds City Council and we can take no responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of any linked websites. If you decide to access websites linked to ours, you do so at your own risk.
