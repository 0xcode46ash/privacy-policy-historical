In addition to placing advertisements on certain non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web pages, these services may also place a segment of code called a clear pixel tag, also known as a "GIF", on certain BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web pages for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of advertisements in bringing visitors to our Web sites. GIFs may also be used with cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Web site, the number of visitors to various Web pages, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.
