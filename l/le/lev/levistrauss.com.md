# Levi Strauss & Co. | Privacy Policy

  
_This privacy policy is applicable to all Levi Strauss & Co. Web sites._

Levi Strauss & Co. adheres to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations and is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Web sites and retail sites. We have developed our privacy practices from guidelines established by the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Association of National Advertisers, and the Direct Marketing Association.

**Gathering and Use of Information:** Levi Strauss & Co. collects information voluntarily provided from our consumers through our Web sites, 800 numbers, retail locations, registration cards, and any other points of personal data gathering. We do not require personal information to obtain general access to any of our Web sites or retail sites. The information collected is used to improve our services to you and to better serve your buying needs.

The information collected from you on our Web sites and at our retail stores provides Levi Strauss & Co. with valuable information about your interactions with our brands, assists us with the development of new products and services, and helps us evaluate what types of information might be of interest to you. By using information in this manner, we can ensure that we will continue to offer you the best experience possible. Please note that any information you submit implies consent for use of the information.

After you register with us (on our brand sites), with your permission, we may occasionally send you information or promotional materials on Levi Strauss & Co. products and services that might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to be contacted by us in the future, you can request to be removed from our e-mail or mailing lists at any time by sending us an e-mail at [levistrauss@levi.com](mailto:levistrauss@levi.com).

**Internet users:** We record and store information provided when browsing our Web sites, including your e-mail address. We also keep a record of your product interests and any information you choose to give us, such as e-mail comments and registration information. Additionally, Levi Strauss & Co. uses cookie technology to assist in making decisions about changes to our Web sites on an ongoing basis. Cookies help us determine, without collecting for personal information, which information on our Web sites appeals to our consumers by tracking which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used.

Please be assured that the personal information collected is protected from public access through the use of passwords, which you choose upon registration (on our brand sites). You can change your personal information by going to the Membership page on our (brand) Web sites and updating your profile. While we do share personally identifiable information with our affiliates and business partners, Levi Strauss & Co. does not currently provide personal information to any other third party. Should our policy on the use of personal information change, we will post an updated policy on our Web site or contact you directly. We will not use your information in a way different from what was originally disclosed to you at the time you provided the information without your prior approval.

**Links:** Levi Strauss & Co. Web sites may contain "links" to other Web sites. We recommend that you check the specific privacy policy of any site before providing any personal information.

Policies for Individuals Under 13: This Web site is not directed to children. Levi Strauss & Co. does not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13. If individuals under 13 years of age wish to participate in contests or promotions, they must obtain the consent of their parent or guardian. If we find that we have inadvertently collected information from individuals under 13 years of age without parental consent, we will promptly delete that information from our database.
