# Lehman's Non-electric Catalog

A lot has been said recently about privacy on the Internet and some folks are rightly concerned. Really, there are two issues: (1) making sure no one can "snoop" and see your private information and (2) your right to know how that information is stored and used. Let's address each of these in simple, no-nonsense terms. 

**1\. Transmitting private information**

The information you provide to us (name and address, your password, credit card numbers, etc.) is transmitted across the Internet using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This means that all of the data is encrypted and for all practical purposes cannot be intercepted by any third party. In most browsers, a padlock or key icon tells you that you're connected to a secure Web site. 

**2\. Use of your private information.**

We ask only for the information we need. You can browse our interactive catalog in complete anonymity. When you make a purchase, we ask for your address and credit card information for billing and shipping purposes. If you send us feedback and request a response, we ask for your e-mail address. All of this information is kept only at Lehman's. When registering, you may specify that your name and address not be made available to any other company and we will honor your wishes.
