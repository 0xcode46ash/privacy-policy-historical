# Lexar - Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Lexar at [www.lexar.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404053557id_/http%3A//www.lexar.com/about/index.html). Lexar has adopted this Privacy Statement to explain what personal information we need, why we need it, and how we protect it. The information we collect about you is used to process your order efficiently and to provide you with a personalized and enjoyable online experience. Details about our privacy policy are described below. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

**Security:** Lexar utilizes technology, security features, and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of our customer information. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server and secure server software (SSL)-based encryption of all information you input. In addition, all customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**Information Collection and Use:** When you create a new customer profile, we ask for your name, company, mailing address, and e-mail address. When you place an order through our Online Store, we ask for your credit card number and card expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Once an online order has been confirmed, credit card information is not reused. 

We may use the information we collect to notify you periodically about important changes to the website, new Lexar products and services, and special offers that may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us at [info@lexar.com](mailto:info@lexar.com). 

**Use of "Cookies":** Lexar uses cookies (small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive) to recall your e-mail address and other information stored in your customer profile. For example, our Online Store uses cookies to remember the contents of your shopping cart as you make your selections, and to recall your billing address. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifying information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features of our site. 

**Disclosure:** Lexar does not currently, but may in the future, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to others (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process). We may also provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information. 

**Children under 13:** Lexar takes children's privacy seriously. Lexar does not seek to collect personal information about children through any of its web sites. If a child submits information through any part of our website and we know that the person submitting the information is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. 

**Your Consent:** By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Lexar. If in the future we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the kind of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
