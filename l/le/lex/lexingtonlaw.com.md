Sensitive Information: Sensitive information is used by Lexington to provide enrolled clients with the services requested.

Next time you log into the client section of our web site you can simply enter your Client ID and password — the system will automatically look up the information it needs.

_Under What Circumstances Lexington Shares Your Information_

Personal Contact Information: Because the ability to communicate with our clients during any part of the credit recovery process is absolutely essential, your personal contact information may be shared with other Lexington employees. They will protect your personal information in accordance with the Lexington Customer Privacy Policy. Lexington will not share your personal contact information with other companies unless you specify otherwise.

Lexington works with other companies that help us provide Lexington services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, should we need to forward written documents to you we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver more efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with Lexington's policies.

In addition, Lexington uses your personal contact information to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, feature updates, special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information in order to contact you regarding participation in a market research survey, so that we can gauge client satisfaction and improve our services further.

Sensitive Information: There may be some circumstances in which Lexington shares certain sensitive information with a third-party vendor. However, when this occurs, the information is encrypted and Lexington assures that it is handled in a manner consistent with this privacy policy and relevant laws. Sensitive information is only given to third party vendors when necessary to carry out the legitimate business objectives for which you retained the Firm. The circumstances under which sensitive information are shared with third parties include disputes and interventions to credit bureaus and creditors as well as processing of payments.

**How We Protect Your Information**

Lexington safeguards the security of the data you send with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

• **Application of Encryption Technologies**  
Lexington's web site uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where sensitive personal information, including social security numbers, is collected. To sign up for service, or to log into the client section of the web site, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card or checking account information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.

• **Employee Access, Training and Expectations**  
Lexington's corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, Lexington's business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.

• **Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information**   
Lexington may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. Privileged information about a client's case is shared only when required by a court order or with a client's express, written permission.

• **Sharing Information with Outside Parties**  
Lexington may provide aggregate information about our site visitors and related Web site information to our affiliates, but this information will not include sensitive information.

**Attorney-Client Privilege.** Because Lexington is a law firm, information about a client's case is considered privileged and is shared only when required by a court order or with a client's express, written permission.

Lexington does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

• **Third-Party Web Site Links**  
Lexington's web site may contain links to other sites. Lexington does not share your personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

• **Changes to the Use of Personal Information**  
If Lexington is going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
