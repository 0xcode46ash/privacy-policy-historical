# Privacy Policy - Les Mills Global

**Version 1.0**

**In this policy:**  

  * "we" or "LMI" means Les Mills International Limited or any related Les Mills company or agent providing you with our services. 

  * "you" means you, the person using our services, or visiting our website 

  * "services" means all goods or services we provide and anything else we do for you, including providing you with access to our website. 




Les Mills International Limited (“LMI”) and its affiliates operate the lesmills.com website (the “Site”). LMI is committed to ensuring the privacy and protection of our visitors and members. The following privacy policy governs LMI’s practices for information collection, use and retention on the Site.

**Types of Information Collected:**

You agree that we may collect information about you. The information may be obtained from you or generated within the LMI Site when you access the Site or use our services.  You may decide whether to provide any information we seek from you. However, if you do not provide it, we, or our affiliates, may not be able to provide some or all of our services to you.

**Traffic Data**

As you navigate within the Site, we automatically track and collect information about your computer, PDA, telephone or other voice Internet portals. This information includes IP address, device specifications, domain server, browser specifications, mobile identification number and telecommunications identifying information. As you use our services, we may collect information about which websites or WAP sites you visit.

**Purpose for Collecting Information**

****If you are just surfing and reading information on the Site, then we collect and store the following information about your visit:

  * the IP address of your machine when connected to the Internet and the domain name from which you are accessing the Internet 

  * the operating system and the browser your computer uses, and any search engine you are using 

  * the date and time you are visiting 

  * the URLs of the pages you visit 

  * if you provide it, your email address. 




We use that information to measure the number of visitors to different parts of the Site and, for example, to measure the effectiveness of advertising. Although we may publish aggregated information about usage patterns, we do not disclose information about individual machines except for the reasons set out below. We do not sell information that identifies you personally. We may gather more extensive information if we are concerned, for example, about security issues. If we think it is necessary, we can disclose information to relevant law enforcement authorities, such as the police. 

**Use Provisions**

LMI will not provide or release your personal information to a third party unless you have opted-in for a promotion.  You agree that LMI may send you information on forthcoming promotions or services unless you have specifically opted-out of receiving such information.  The Site will have a facility for you to do so. 

Traffic data and personal data may be used by LMI for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of users' behaviour, for product development, for content improvement, and to inform advertisers of how may visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements. In these cases, data is reported on an aggregate (i.e., group) basis. We may share this information with other parties, but when we do so it is not traceable to any particular user. In addition, traffic and personal data may be used to customize and tailor your experience on the Site, by displaying content that we think you may be interested in. 

We will, without specific or further notice to you, release your traffic data and personal data when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to: protect the rights, property or safety of LMI, the Site, our users or others; enforce our terms and conditions of use; to provide the services you directly request from us through the Site; comply with any applicable law, a court order or other legal process; in the course of responding to any claim by a third party that you are using services provided through the Site in connection with an infringing, illegal or improper activity or that data you placed on the Site infringes rights of the third party; in response to request for identification in connection with a claim of copyright or trade mark infringement by you; to an affiliate or service provider engaged to maintain or host the Site, subject to that party's agreement to honour this Privacy Policy. 

**Retention of Information**

We may hold information you provide to us, share it with our affiliates, employees and contractors, with credit reference agencies and with collection agencies. This enables us and our affiliates to: 

  * provide services to you; 

  * send you bills and recover money you owe; 

  * keep you informed of services available to you from us and other people; 

  * exercise any lawful right any of us has. 




We may share aggregated information which does not identify any individual with partners, advertisers and others. 

**Access to Your Personal Information    
**  
You may ask to see any personal information we hold about you.  As long as we can readily retrieve it, we will provide it to you.  You may also ask for any details that are wrong to be corrected. 

**Cookies**

The Site may place a cookie on the hard drive of your computer and your browser may accept small identifying files from our system. A "cookie" is a file that allows us to track and target the interests of users.  We may use Cookies to keep track of pending transactions, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, deliver content that is specific to your interests, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other lawful purposes which abide by this Privacy Policy. While we recommend that users enable cookies on their browsers in order to enjoy all the features of the Site, this decision remains in the hands of the individual. (The management of cookies will differ depending on each user's PC - refer to your browser help menu for further information). Your browser may decline the Cookie if it is set to do so. Declining Cookies will limit the functionality of the Site. 

**Linked Sites**

****The Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such websites, WAP sites or voice interactive applications.

**Public Forums**

****We may provide you with chat features, instant messaging, message boards, and/or news groups. Please remember that any information that you may disclose in the public areas of the Site will become public information, and any information that is disclosed in a private forum will become accessible to all other members of that forum. We do not intend to monitor, moderate, screen or otherwise be responsible for the contents of postings. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in public or private forums.

  
**Security**

The Site has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information within our control. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. These measures may or may not be vulnerable to hacking, and we do not guarantee complete security. 

  
**Lost or Stolen Information**

You must notify us promptly if your user name or password is lost, stolen or used without permission. Upon notice, we will cancel that user name or password and update our records accordingly. 

  
**Opt-Out Option**

We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communication from us or our affiliates when we request information from you. You may send a request to remove your information from our database, stop future communication, limit the use of your information, or to review and modify information that you may have previously provided. Such requests can be sent via the contact information provided in the "Contact Us" section below.
