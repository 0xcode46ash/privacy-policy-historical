PRIVACY POLICY 

Leslie's Swimming Pool Supplies ("Leslie's") shares your concern about keeping your personal information confidential. To address that concern, we have adopted a comprehensive privacy policy, which is set forth in detail below.

REGISTRATION

While we encourage you to register with us when you place orders or otherwise visit our web site, registration is not required of anyone. The registration process simply helps us to provide you with a personalized shopping experience, and with much easier checkout options. On our "My Account" or "Catalog Request" forms, you will be asked to give us certain contact information, such as your name, a created password, a password hint (to help you if you can't remember your password during future visits to the web site), and an e-mail address. If you would like, you can also complete a customer profile that you will use in "My Account" if you choose to set up such an account. We use some or all of that customer information to send you e-mail updates about any orders received or shipped, upcoming sales and promotions and product information. We also hope to learn more about our customers' needs and wants to improve the Leslie's shopping experience. In addition, we use that information, when necessary, to contact you concerning the status of an order or to answer any of your questions. You must be 13 years of age or older to register.

At all times, you have the right to "opt out" from receiving future e-mail updates by simply following the unsubscribe links at the bottom of every Leslie's email. We respect your right to privacy and will delete the requested email address from our site within 72 hours. 

ORDER INFORMATION

We provide an order form for you to use to request information or purchase products. When you place an order, we will collect certain personal information, such as your shipping and e-mail addresses, and certain financial information, such as your account number or credit card number, and we will place that information on a secured server. Your address and personal information is used to send orders and information about us to you and to contact you when necessary. Your financial information is used for billing purposes. Since you also have the option of purchasing products over the telephone, you can always elect to pay us by check. If you register with our web site in the "My Account" section, however, we can store your credit card and other information on file on our secure servers for your use on future orders. Thus, in the future, when you log on, you will be able to review the particular information for your card to confirm that it is the card you want to use again. All other credit card information is hidden, so that, for example, even you will not see your entire credit card number if you attempt to access it. 

USE OF INFORMATION

Leslie's will not collect any information which is purely personal, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, unless you specifically provide it to us when you visit our web site. We will not sell or share any personal information about you to or with any third party. At times, we may share aggregate, or summary information, such as statistics about our customers, sales traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. All such information, however, will not include any personally identifiable information about you. 

UPDATING INFORMATION

From time to time, you may want to change or modify the information that was previously provided by you. In order to perform that function, access the "My Account" page and update your information using the options provided on that page.

In order to remove your information from our database, simply follow the opt out / unsubscribe procedures contained at the bottom of every Leslie's email or send an email to our Webmaster from the "Contact Us" section of this site with 'Unsubscribe' in the subject line and the email address you wish removed listed below .
