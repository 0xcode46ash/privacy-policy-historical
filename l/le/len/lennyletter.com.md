### What Personally Identifiable Information Does Lenny Collect?

Lenny collects the following types of personally identifiable information:

  * _User Provided Information_ : In order to sign up for our email newsletter, you must provide Lenny with your email address. In addition, you may affirmatively provide Lenny with certain other personally identifiable information (such as your name, postal address, phone number, etc.).
  * _Information Collected by “Cookies”_ : When you visit the Website, Lenny may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A “cookie” is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser, which Lenny uses to help provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Lenny may use cookies for many purposes, including (without limitation) to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website, and to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests.
  * _Log File Information_ : Lenny’s servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit the Website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  * _Information Collected by “Clear GIFs”_ : Lenny may employ “clear GIFs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons), which are used to track the online usage patterns anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, Lenny may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to users to track which emails are opened by recipients.



### How Does Lenny Use Personally Identifiable Information?

Lenny will use your email address to send you the email newsletter. In addition, Lenny may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages. Lenny also may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Website changes or for customer service purposes). You cannot opt out of receiving emails for non-marketing or administrative purposes.

Lenny uses aggregated information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. In addition, Lenny may use “cookies” clear gifs and log file information to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests, and remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website.

### Third-party Advertisers

Lenny may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to them, and Lenny cannot control their activities.

### Is My Information Secure?

Lenny has implemented security measures to protect personally identifiable information collected on the Website against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer. Moreover, despite the precautions described above, Lenny cannot and does not guarantee that the individual user information you have transmitted will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed, and it accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure.

### In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that Lenny is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, it reserves the right to transfer or assign the information it has collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of Lenny’s bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, Lenny may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

### Children’s Privacy

You must be 18 years and older to register to use the Website. As a result, Lenny does not collect information about children.
