# LookSmart - About Us

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/2345)

LookSmart has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy. As a member of the TRUSTe program, LookSmart gladly complies with TRUSTe's privacy principles. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the following LookSmart sites: www.looksmart.com, www.insidetheweb.com and www.beseen.com. 

TRUSTe is an independent, nonprofit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because LookSmart wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe mark, you can expect to be notified about: 

  1. What information this site gathers/tracks about you
  2. What organization is collecting the information
  3. What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks
  4. With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information gathered/tracked
  6. This site's policy on correcting and updating personally identifiable information
  7. This site's policy on deleting or deactivating your name from our database
  8. What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control
  9. This site's links to other sites

We suggest that you practice reasonable discretion with any site when providing it with personal information. Note also that whenever you post personal information in publicly accessible places, such as chat rooms or message boards, this information becomes available to anyone with access to the Internet. Therefore, we recommend that you refrain from posting any information you do not want seen in these public areas. You should feel free to contact any site that requests personal information from you if you have any questions regarding its policies. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or your dealings with this Web site, contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html) or [LookSmart's Privacy Advocate](mailto:privacy@looksmart.net). 

**What information does LookSmart collect?**

At different times, LookSmart may collect five types of information about you. 

First, we use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user but may be correlated with identity information in our log files. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser's preference options, but you may not be able to utilize some services properly. 

Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider. LookSmart may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries. 

Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form. 

Fourth, at specific times we may ask you to provide us with personal information in order for you to register for a service (e.g., to set up a LookSmart Email account or to create a message board on InsideTheWeb) or to enter a sweepstakes. This information may include but is not limited to your name and email address. You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or offer you personalized content. For example, LookSmart's email registration form requests that you provide contact information (such as an alternate email address) and demographic information (such as age and gender), as well as information regarding your interests; if you do not provide us with certain, required information, we cannot open an email account for you. 

Fifth, we may collect credit card information if you register for any paid services on our site, such as Express Listing on LookSmart. We make our best efforts to protect credit card transactions through encryption, although we cannot guarantee complete security. In order to complete a transaction, payment information may be transferred through one of our partners who process such information. 

**What organization is collecting the information?**

LookSmart usually collects the requested information. However, LookSmart has chosen select partners in order to provide you with full-service Web sites. LookSmart's partners provide users with services such as email and classified ads. In order to use these areas, it may be necessary to enter information that then goes to our partner and is not kept by LookSmart. The areas of our sites in which partners are collecting information may be cobranded with our partners' logos. 

If you have any questions regarding who is collecting or receiving the information you provide on our sites, please contact us. 

Some of the sections in which we use content partners include, but are not limited to, the following: 

  * Classifieds 
  * Email 
  * Personals 
  * Localized content 
  * Horoscopes 
  * Chat 
  * Weather 

If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data-collection practices of one of our content partners, please contact that partner directly. 

Some of our content partners, as well as advertisers who display ads on our site, may use cookies. We do not control their use of cookies or have access to the information contained in or related to those cookies. 

**What does LookSmart do with the data it collects?**

Whenever LookSmart collects data, the data is intended to tailor or improve the experience of visitors to our site. From the data collected we can customize content and advertising based on the user's preferences. We analyze what our users prefer in order to improve LookSmart. 

We use information from a cookie (a feature of your browser used to assign identification to your computer) to count and track site visits in the aggregate, to personalize the site for each unique user, to control the frequency of individual advertisements directed to individual computers, and to target advertisements to broad demographic segments. For example, if an advertiser wants to target males between the ages of 25 and 40, we will limit ad presentation to this group. We also use information about your interests to display banner advertisements. Some broad statistical customer data is provided to our advertisers (e.g., percentage of males or females visiting the site), but specific personal information is not shared with our advertisers, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy. 

We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web sites. IP addresses may be disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or to protect the rights or property of LookSmart or others. If you use InsideTheWeb message boards, your IP address at the time of posting may be publicly displayed along with your post, at the moderator's option. 

When you register for unique services on our sites - such as to create an email account, a message board or a personalized stock portfolio, or to add a service to your site from Beseen, such as the Smartlinks Search box - we collect additional information from you in order to provide you with those specific services and to personalize your experience on the site. We may use such information to target offerings that may be of interest to you and/or to analyze aggregate user data in order to improve our services. In addition, several other services on LookSmart (such as the weather and horoscope services) utilize a cookie to track your selections during your visit (such as your star sign or your city) so that we can supply you with correct services and information. That cookie may be supplied by LookSmart or one of its content partners. 

On occasion we will email bulletins to provide you with information that we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services. We might also contact you to see if you are interested in participating in market research regarding LookSmart. Many of our sites also send a monthly or bimonthly newsletter by email to their users. It is our policy to send these promotional emails only to customers who give us permission to do so. In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe and avoid receiving any future emails from us. Please see our Opt Out Policy section below. LookSmart also may contact you by email to respond to customer-service complaints you have submitted, to address a problem affecting your use of the service or to verify your account information if you submit a password request. 

Users who have submitted a site suggestion through Express Listing may receive separate promotional information on occasion, by email or telephone call. If you participate in message boards on InsideTheWeb, we may use your email address to contact you concerning matters pertaining to messages boards that you moderate. If you participate in chat rooms on Beseen, your gender may be displayed by icon during the chat conversation if you have provided that information to us. 

**With whom does LookSmart share data?**

LookSmart may disclose your personal information to our business partners in order to provide you with the services you have requested, or to companies that offer a cobranded version of one of our sites. If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data-collection practices of one of our content partners, please contact that partner directly. LookSmart does not have control over and is not responsible for the data collection and use practices of our business partners. 

We also may disclose your personal information to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, to protect the rights or property of LookSmart or others, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy. 

We may share aggregate demographic information with our advertisers. 

If you submit questions to LookSmart Live!, those questions may be shared with one of our partners, but only with your permission. 

**What choices are available regarding collection, use and distribution of the information (Opt Out Policy)?**

Many of the services available on our sites provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners. In addition, in the majority of our email communications, we will have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future emails from us if you so choose. 

As previously noted, you may always choose to not provide us with any of the information we request; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or limit our ability to offer personalized content. For example, LookSmart's email registration form requests your contact information (such as an alternate email address), demographic information (such as your age and gender) as well as information regarding your interests. 

**How can you update or correct your information? **

Certain users of Beseen (such as chatters) can review and modify their account or profile information on the site or alternatively by email. Message-board moderators on InsideTheWeb can change or modify account information by signing in at www.insidetheweb.com. 

LookSmart does not currently have a method for users to change their user information. In the case of personalized services, you will be able to modify your user information through personalization links on those pages. 

**How can you delete your information or deactivate your membership?**

If you would like to deactivate your membership with one of the services offered on LookSmart, please visit that service on the site. If you would like to deactivate membership in one of the services for which you have registered through Beseen or InsideTheWeb, please email support@beseen.com or support@insidetheweb.com, respectively. 

LookSmart currently does not have a method for completely deleting user information from our database. However, deleting the cookie stored on your computer will cause you to be perceived as a new user with no known user data. You may also change a setting in your browser, instructing it not to accept cookies, but this could prevent you from receiving some LookSmart services. 

Some information is automatically deleted from our site after a certain period of time. For example, InsideTheWeb message boards that are inactive for a period of 45 days may be deleted automatically from the system. On Beseen, most chat dialogue is deleted every 24 hours. 

Moderators of message boards on InsideTheWeb who wish to have their board deleted at an earlier time (together with any contact or demographic information provided at registration) may send an email to support@insidetheweb.com, containing the username and password for the board to be deleted. Individuals requesting deletion of a board may be asked for information to confirm their identity as the moderator of the board in question. 

**What procedures have been designed to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under LookSmart's control?**

Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, LookSmart has taken measures to ensure that information that is not publicly available through its sites is accessible only to the user who initially entered the information or to authorized personnel at LookSmart or its partners, and only after a password has been entered. 

**What about privacy policies for sites linked to LookSmart? **

LookSmart contains links to other sites not affiliated with LookSmart. These sites have their own policies and practices with respect to online privacy, and LookSmart cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these unaffiliated Web sites. In addition, in certain instances a LookSmart advertiser may ask you for personal information. LookSmart cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of its advertisers. 

**Notification of Changes**

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the web site. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions to our privacy policy.
