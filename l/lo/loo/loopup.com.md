# LoopUp Privacy Policy | Conference Call and Online Meetings Service

V4_1, last updated: 13 August 2013 

* * *

Although we use the European term **personal data** in this policy, we use it as interchangeable with the **US term personally identifiable information.** In each case we mean any information identifying a living natural person or which could identify that person in conjunction with other information, such as their name, numbers or address and we protect it regardless of the term applied.

 **Your use of our services is your consent to our use of your personal data (and other data you provide to us) in accordance with this policy, including (if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (‘EEA’)) the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.**

As data protection law and practice is constantly developing, and we’ll also continue to innovate, we’ll need to update this policy now and then by posting a new policy on our websites that takes effect from the date stated. It is your responsibility to return to our websites from time to time and check for changes. By providing us with personal data about yourself or others, whether by visiting our websites, using our products or services or otherwise, you agree to our processing the personal data you provide to us in accordance with the then-current version of this policy.

## Who Are We?

LOOPUP, CALLEFFECT and RING2 are trading names of the Ring2 group of companies, which includes the UK parent company Ring2 Communications Limited (‘ **LoopUp UK** ’) and its subsidiaries Ring2 Communications LLC in San Francisco (‘ **LoopUp USA** ’), Ring2 (HK) Ltd in Hong Kong (‘ **LoopUp HK** ’) and Ring2 (Barbados) Ltd in Barbados (‘ **LoopUp BBD** ’). ‘ **Us** ’, ‘ **we** ’ and ‘ **our** ’ mean one or all of LoopUp UK, LoopUp USA and/or LoopUp HK, according to the context. All of the Ring2 group of companies agree to abide by this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

## How Do We Obtain Personal Data?

In a number of ways, for example:

  * You might directly provide us with your details when you ask about our services and, when you become a customer, you might give us further information such as your employer, credit card information, and other information for security issues, such as date of birth, usernames, passwords and password reminders. We call this ‘ **Account Data** ’.
  * We may receive personal data from our customers and their participants when they use our services and our software, eg: names and numbers when people dial in to a conference or are dialed out to by the leader; customers using the Administrator Portal to add Leaders (their end users who lead or host conferences) or change their Leader profiles; Leaders and their delegates changing Leader profiles; customers might ask us to reference their contact database; public profiles on social media and networking services; and resolving names by checking the numbers on your conference against your mobile or PC address book. We call this ‘ **Service Data** ’.
  * When you visit our websites, we may collect information about your visit such as your IP address and the pages you visited. We may analyse such information, for example for technical purposes and to improve the customer experience.
  * We may also receive information because someone you know thought you would appreciate our services and used our ‘Tell a Friend’ service.



When you provide us with personal data about yourself or another person, you are confirming to us that you are authorised to provide us with that information and that any personal data you give us is accurate and up-to-date.

## How Do We Use Personal Data?

We use personal data in the usual course of our business, for example:

  * To respond to enquiries, to provide our website, software and services and to invoice accordingly.
  * To analyse our business, looking at technology, performance, customer service, marketing, finance, billing, and the prevention or detection of fraud.
  * To communicate with you about same or similar services that we offer, whether they are our own services or services that we resell. If we do so, we will provide you with an easy and free way to opt-out of receiving such communications in the future.
  * In certain instances to share it within our group of companies and with limited third parties as described in this policy, eg: for service provision and business continuity purposes.



If we receive your credit card or other financial information, we will only use it to process the relevant payments and will at all times comply with the applicable industry codes and laws regarding security and retention of such data.

## Sharing Data & International Transfers

First, we will not give, sell or rent your personal data to third parties so they can market their services to you. Nor do we accept advertising from third parties on our websites. We do share personal data as follows:

  * A key benefit of our services is to make conferences and remote meetings more productive by showing who’s on a conference, and other data, to the conference participants in accordance with this policy. Customers’ Administrators can use the Administrator Portal to review, edit, change or delete all information on their accounts including adding and removing Leaders and reviewing Leaders’ details and history. Delegates can manage the conferences of Leaders for whom they’re authorised (apart from changing a Leader’s profile). Passwords are not visible.
  * To provide a global service to you, and to provide for disaster recovery and business continuity, we may share information, including your personal data, between our datacenters in Chicago, USA, London, UK and Hong Kong. These are state-of-the-art datacenters hosted in locations operated by specialist third parties, and we have written contracts in place incorporating relevant wording to safeguard personal data.
  * We share the minimal personal data required with our suppliers, eg: telephone numbers with our carrier partners, identity with credit agencies for credit checks, payment details with finance partners, and otherwise with our contractors and advisors to help us operate, secure and analyse our business.
  * We may be obliged to disclose your personal data to comply with any law, order or request of a court, government authority, other competent legal or regulatory authority or any applicable code of practice or guideline.
  * If we enter negotiations with third parties for the sale or purchase of all or part of our business, we will only disclose personal data to that third party to the extent it relates to that business and only under conditions of confidentiality requiring the third party to be bound by the privacy policy that applies to that data.



We’re a global business providing a global service and therefore certain of the third parties mentioned in the paragraph above may be outside the USA, the European Economic Area or in countries whose laws do not provide adequate protection to personal data (as determined under EU or UK law). In all cases we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect your personal data. For example, LoopUp UK and LoopUp USA have entered into the European Model Clauses on transfer of personal data outside the EEA with each other for these purposes. **You consent to such transfers when you use our services.**

## Live Call Status

It’s much more useful, and your calls are more productive, when you know who’s on your conference by name, not just by number. It makes it much easier for the leader to effectively manage the conference and for everyone to achieve their results faster. When you’re on a LoopUp conference a list of the participants’ names and/or numbers, as well as their status such as “on hold” etc, is viewable by those on the conference – we call this Live Call Status. As part of our award-winning conferencing service, we provide Live Call Status not just through browsers online but also on smartphones using our proprietary software; and we allow the call leader full control over each call leg, so they know who is on the call and can eg: rename call legs, put them on mute or hold and drop them if they don’t recognize them. Also, where a public profile on a social media or networking service is available for someone on a conference, we may display some or all of that public profile in Live Call Status subject to obtaining any relevant consent.

## Information from Participants

As a participant on a conference, you might provide us with your name and number when using our FastJoin capability to join (by entering your name on our website or through a mobile application), saying your name when you join, or allowing the number of the phone you are calling from (called your CLI or Calling Line Identification) to be passed on. In such cases, that is your consent to our including your name, CLI or other data we receive as part of Live Call Status. You can always dial-in and block your CLI if you wish and your service provider will be able to tell you how.

## ‘Name Resolution’

As above, if a participant joins a LoopUp session using FastJoin, they’ll be shown in Live Call Status by the name and number they entered during the FastJoin process. Similarly, if a participant has been added to the session by the conference leader initiating a call to that participant, the name associated with that participant by the conference leader will be displayed in Live Call Status. However, if neither of the above leads to a name for a number on your conference, we’ll try to resolve that number against a name as follows.

First we do a “back-end look-up” in three ways:

  * we check if the number is for one of our other registered LoopUp users,
  * if you or your employer have provided us with a contact list for this purpose, we’ll check against that (only for your account’s conferences, we won’t use it for other customers’ conferences), and
  * where allowed by law, we may carry out a look-up against a third-party database. If we do, we’ll ensure that third party maintains confidentiality.



If this back-end lookup produces a name, we show that in Live Call Status to all participants.

Second, we do a ”local look-up“: the conference leader’s and participant’s respective LoopUp mobile apps or web client check the number against the device’s address book and cached numbers in the software respectively. If the number is resolved to a name, it is only shown locally in that software – the name is not transferred off that local device or PC, nor is it displayed in Live Call Status for others to see. A local look-up will take priority over a back-end look-up. Also, if the call leader has enabled the feature, the leader’s LoopUp Toolbar for Outlook will send any name resolution to Live Call Status; so everyone on the call can see the update as if the leader had edited the name themselves.

Names are shown as above and also in the summary and details of the conference we provide the conference leader afterwards, on their Call History webpage, in the post-conference email and in their invoice.

## Screen Sharing

Screen sharing allows you to share your screen or a selectable area of your screen in real time with others on your conference. The content is only made available to those on your conference at that time and no copy is kept unless the conference leader asks us to record their conference for them, in which case, please see the Recording section below.

## CallEffect™

CallEffect operates within a third-party application or ‘TPA’, such as Salesforce.com, allowing you to click to call people within the TPA, take the call on your normal landline or mobile phone, and automatically log the call within the TPA with any notes you want. By using CallEffect, you automatically transfer a copy of the names and phone numbers displayed within the live webpage of the TPA to our system so we can offer the service and make the call. Once that data leaves the TPA, it is no longer governed by their privacy policy; instead it is governed by our contract with you. While we only act as a data processor of that data, during that processing the data is protected by the technical and operational measures that are part of our continuing data security practices.

## ‘Tell a Friend’

If you give us a person’s details using our ‘Tell a Friend’ service you warrant that you have consent to do so, the person is over 18 years old and the email sent is not unwanted or malicious (if you do not use our standard wording). You understand we will tell the person receiving the email that it was sent by you or on your recommendation. If we receive your personal data from a subscriber using our ‘Tell a Friend’ service, we will send you an email with your friend’s message and details on how to sign up to our service and give you an unsubscribe method. If you unsubscribe, we will only retain your personal data for the purpose of checking that we do not send you another email under the ‘Tell a Friend’ service.

## Recordings

If the conference leader asks us to record all or part of their conference, we will play an audio notification to all on the call, and make it clear that the conference is being recorded in other media as appropriate. We’ll make the recording available in electronic format to the conference leader (and their Administrator) for download within 60 days after the conference ends, and we’ll delete the recording from our system after 90 days. If you ask us to record a conference, you warrant that you have the consent of all parties on that conference to do so and that you will only use such recording in accordance with all applicable laws, including data protection laws.

Separately, we reserve the right, in accordance with applicable law, to monitor or record any telephone call or other communication with us, eg: for training purposes or to monitor the quality of customer services. We will notify you when a recording is taking place as required by law.

## Cookies, Web Beacons etc.

Our site uses ‘cookies’ and web beacons, and when you use our services we use cookies, to deliver and optimize your experience. You can see more in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookie-policy/ "LoopUp Cookie Policy"), which is part of (and incorporated into) this Privacy Policy.

## Sensitive Personal Data

Given the nature of our business, we do not ask for ‘sensitive personal data’, such as information about your health, political opinions, racial origins or sexual life and we’re unlikely to receive it. However, as a user of our services, you may choose to transmit sensitive personal data over our services to your conference participants. If you do so: (a) you must have full authority or consent to do so and (b) you acknowledge that we do not monitor or review content transmitted over our services and (c) as with any content you transmit, it will be dealt with according to this privacy policy, including possible transfer to our offices or the third parties described in this policy, inside or outside the EEA in the situations described in this policy.

## Retention

We will only retain personal data for a reasonable period based on our contract with you and business requirements, for example to use that particular data as described in this policy or to comply with any law, order of a court, government authority, other competent legal or regulatory authority or any applicable code of practice or guideline.

## Security

The security of data is central to our business and, in accordance with our legal obligations, we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data and keep those measures under review. For example, our data-centres are protected by industry-standard technical and operational security such as IT firewalls and access restrictions at their physical locations. However, we can only be responsible for systems that we control and we would remind you that the internet itself is not a secure environment. So when you send us an email, that communication may only be encrypted if you use the necessary software.

## Your Rights

You are entitled to know if we are processing any personal data about you and, if we are, with certain limitations, to a copy of that personal data. You can also ask us to remove or correct inaccurate personal data we hold about you and that we do not use your details to contact you for marketing purposes. We’ll ask you to prove your identity when you make such a request.
