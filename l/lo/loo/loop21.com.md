# Privacy Policy | Loop21

### The Loop

It is The Loop's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, The Loop collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Loop’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The Loop’s visitors use its website. From time to time,The Loop may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. The Loop also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The Loop does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to The Loop’s websites choose to interact with The Loop in ways that require The Loop to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The Loop gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who want to post comments at [www.TheLoop21.com](http://www.theloop21.com/) to log in. Those who engage in transactions with The Loop – by logging in to their accounts, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, The Loop collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with The Loop. The Loop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

The Loop may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, The Loop may monitor the most popular parts of the The Loop site. The Loop may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, The Loop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

The Loop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on The Loop's behalf or to provide services available at The Loop’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using The Loop’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The Loop will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, The Loop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when The Loop believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of The Loop, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of The Loop Web site and have supplied your email address, The Loop may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with The Loop. We expect to keep this type of e-mail to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The Loop takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The Loop uses cookies to help The Loop identify and track visitors, their usage of The Loop website, and their website access preferences. The Loop visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using The Loop’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of The Loop’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, The Loop may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in The Loop’s sole discretion. The Loop encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
