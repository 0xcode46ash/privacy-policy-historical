# Privacy Policy | Loop21.com

####  Loop 21

It is Loop 21's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

####  Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Loop 21 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Loop 21’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Loop 21’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Loop 21 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Loop 21 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Loop 21 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

####  Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Loop 21’s websites choose to interact with Loop 21 in ways that require Loop 21 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Loop 21 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who want to post comments at www.Loop21.com to log in. Those who engage in transactions with Loop 21 – by logging in to their accounts, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Loop 21 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Loop 21. Loop 21 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

####  Aggregated Statistics

Loop 21may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Loop 21may monitor the most popular parts of the Loop 21 site. Loop 21 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Loop 21 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

####  Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Loop 21 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Loop 21's behalf or to provide services available at Loop 21’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Loop 21’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Loop 21 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Loop 21 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Loop 21 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Loop 21, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Loop 21 Web site and have supplied your email address, Loop 21 may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Loop 21. We expect to keep this type of e-mail to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Loop 21 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

####  Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Loop 21 uses cookies to help Loop 21 identify and track visitors, their usage of Loop 21 website, and their website access preferences. Loop 21 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Loop 21’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Loop 21’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

####  Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Loop 21 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Loop 21’s sole discretion. Loop 21 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
