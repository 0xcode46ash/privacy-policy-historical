* When you visit Lowe's websites, such as [www.lowes.ca](http://www.lowes.ca/), send e-mail to Lowe's, receive e-mail from Lowe's or access Lowe's online advertising, Lowe's may receive and store certain automatic data to allow its websites to work correctly. This allows Lowe's to evaluate the use of our website and electronic communications and to support the personalization of its communications with you. Lowe's does this through automatic collection tools. The following is a brief description of the automatic data collection tools: 

  * **Cookies**

Lowe's uses "cookies" to recognize you as you use its site. A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer's hard drive. Lowe's or its service providers send cookies when you surf its site or sites where its ads appear, make purchases, request or personalize information or register for certain services. Accepting the cookies used on Lowe's site or sites where our ads appear may give Lowe's access to information about your browsing behavior, which Lowe's may use to personalize your experience. Lowe's uses "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.

    * **Session cookies** do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.
    * **Persistent cookies** remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.

You can choose to browse Lowe's website without accepting cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. 

If you are concerned about information contained in your cookie, you may delete the file(s) at the end of each browser session. View your browser's help file for more information on cookies. You can find information on popular web-browsers and how to adjust cookie preferences for your specific browser. Please see the following links for more information:

<http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_priv_help.html>

  * **Web beacons**

Lowe's may also use web beacons. Web beacons allow Lowe's to know if a certain page was visited, if an email was opened or if its advertisements were effective. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. 

You may be able to disable web beacons in e-mail messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the e-mail software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the e-mail message due to specific e-mail software capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your e-mail software or service provider. 

Lowe's does not store or use information that it gathers through the use of web beacons in a manner that associates that information with you. Lowe's uses this information in an anonymized form to assist with market research and our evaluation of its services and websites.

  * **Embedded web links**

E-mails from Lowe's often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through Lowe's servers. The redirection system allows Lowe's to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. 

In e-mails, such web links may also allow Lowe's to determine whether you have clicked a link in an e-mail, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want Lowe's to collect information about the links that you click, you can change your choice about how you receive communications from Lowe's (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in an e-mail that Lowe's sends.

We do not store or use information that we gather through our use of embedded web links in a manner that associates that information with you. We use this information in an anonymized form to assist with market research and our evaluation of our services and websites.

  * **Lowe's ads on third-party websites**

Lowe's has contracts with service providers to place advertising on websites owned by third parties. The service providers send cookies from and use Web beacons on these third-party websites. The cookies and Web beacons may enable Lowe's to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked. Lowe's has no control over the data collected by the owner of the website where Lowe's ad was placed.

  * **Information gathering tools**

Lowe's may use tools to collect information about your experience on some Lowe's websites. These tools do not involve the use of Web beacons or cookies, but record your interaction with a Lowe's website as captured by a Lowe's server.
