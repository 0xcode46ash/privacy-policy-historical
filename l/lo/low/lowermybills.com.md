# LowerMyBills.com - Privacy Policy

**Information Collection and Use**   
Our goal is to provide you with a safe and enjoyable experience when using our service. You can browse the LowerMyBills.com website at anytime without revealing any personal information about yourself. When we do ask you for information, it is used only for the following important purposes: to process and fulfill your requests for products and services; to solicit your opinions and other feedback; to conduct research; to customize the advertising and content you see; and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. LowerMyBills.com may collect personal information at the following times, with your permission only:

• When you register to receive communications from LowerMyBills.com   
• When you seek information or enter applications for products and services offered through LowerMyBills.com  
• When you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by LowerMyBills.com  
• When you provide such information to us through surveys, feedback, or other forms hosted on LowerMyBills.com's   pages or the pages of certain LowerMyBills.com partner.

In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. LowerMyBills.com may add the information we receive about you to your existing account. Like other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use "Cookies" and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized offers. Likewise, we sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve and track advertisements appearing on our website. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
LowerMyBills.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies. We share customer information only with your permission or under the following circumstances:

•   **Processing Your Requests:** If you apply for a product or service offered through LowerMyBills, we will share your information with certain business partners strictly to process and fulfill your request . Our business partners may contact you by telephone in order to process and fulfill your request even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission. If one of our business partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry or application, then you should specifically make a request to that business partner to not contact you again. If the business partner disregards your request and contacts you again, please let us know immediately by sending an email to [CustomerCare@lowermybills.com](mailto:CustomerCare@lowermybills.com). Our business partners may also contact you to process your request by email or mail based on the information you have provided to us. Such partners may keep such information whether you elect to use their services or not. If you do not want to receive such communications from them, please notify the business partner directly.   
•   **Contracted Partners:** We sometimes disclose the information we collect to companies that perform marketing    services on our behalf. These partners only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified LowerMyBills.com products or services.  
•   **Legal Protection:** We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal rights and defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LowerMyBills.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.  
•   **Business Transfer:** As with any other business, it is possible that LowerMyBills.com in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by LowerMyBills.com, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless you consent otherwise. Notice of a business transfer will be posted here for 30 days. 

**Anti-Spam Policy & Pop Up Windows**   
On occasion, you may receive advertisements for LowerMyBills.com from third parties. For instance, when visiting a third party website, you may receive a "pop up" window advertising LowerMyBills.com. Please note that such advertisements are served by the third party website that you have visited and are not controlled by LowerMyBills.com. In addition, you may receive emails that advertise LowerMyBills.com's services from third party publishers. LowerMyBills.com has established firm ground rules for dealing with any third party email services to ensure that advertisements for LowerMyBills.com are not sent out through a "Spam" mailing -- ensuring that our offers are sent only to those individuals who have given their permission to the third party email service to receive communications. If any third party email publisher refuses to abide by LowerMyBills.com's anti-Spam policy, LowerMyBills.com will not use that publisher's services. If you want to stop receiving emails from a third party, you should follow the opt-out instructions included in the email so that you will not be included in any future mailings. An "unsubscribe" link should appear at the bottom of the email you received. However if for any reason it does not work, please bring that to our attention by emailing us at [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com). 

**Cookies**   
To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used LowerMyBills.com. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. 

**Clear Gifs**   
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. 

**Confidentiality and Security**   
The security of your personal information is very important at LowerMyBills.com and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard personal information about you. We limit access to personal information to those employees and agents who assist us in providing requested products and services to you. In addition, we use industry standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data on the LowerMyBills.com website. We have partnered with VeriSign to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we collect from you. 

**Email Communications and Removal from Mailing List**   
You may register to receive LowerMyBills.com's communications directly on our website or through a third party. Upon registering, we will periodically send you newsletters and other e-mails featuring special and exclusive offers, promotions and other members-only benefits. If you no longer wish to receive these communications, please let us know by sending an email to [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com). (You may also opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails). Our email database is updated weekly. Please note that LowerMyBills.com can only control its own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving such communications. Also, please note that if you enter into a transaction through our website, we may send you a thank you notice, ask for a satisfaction rating, request a testimonial and give you periodic product reminders as part of your service.

**Information Collected by Third Parties**   
This Privacy Pledge applies to all information that you provide to LowerMyBills.com and all information that a third party provides to LowerMyBills.com in conjunction with any service offered on our site. However, when you visit websites to which LowerMyBills.com provides a link, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs.

If LowerMyBills.com receives personal information from a third party that is not in conjunction with a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such information is governed by the agreement (if any) between LowerMyBills.com and such third party.
