Personal Information Usage  
We collect the following personal information for:

**Registration:** email address and zip code. LowerMyBills.com offers a registration for newsletters and special offers, both internal and external. To ensure your privacy, this data is captured and managed in our data warehouse system and is accessed only by those thoroughly trained in the management and security of personal information. The information gathered is used so that you only receive offers of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive future emails from us, please let us know by sending an email to [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com).

**Tell-a-Friend:** email address, zip code, first name, and last name. This information is used to send a one-time email notification inviting your friends to use LowerMyBills.com.

**Customer Service:** email address, zip code, first name, last name. This information is used to find a solution to your problem and/or to answer your question(s).

Customer Tracking: Cookies  
LowerMyBills.com generally uses "cookies" to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used LowerMyBills.com. Additionally, click-stream data is captured on some of our partner sites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our site. This is used to monitor the performance of our partners to ensure that they are completely satisfying your needs. None of the data listed above is individually identifiable information; it will never be sold to third parties.

**Co-Hosted Forms:** email address, address, first and last name, phone number, current utility information (account number, provider, meter number), credit card and/or direct debit bank account routing number, social security number. This information is used to switch your service, pay for your service, and contact you if need be. These forms are SSL-encrypted, and are monitored by VeriSign for your security.

**Site Tools:** We gather information from our online calculators, lookup tools, etc., to analyze the effectiveness of our site, product offerings, and marketing. None of this information is sold or shared with 3rd parties except in aggregate, such as broad demographics, key product interest, etc.

**Survey:** We occasionally ask our users to participate in surveys to help us better determine ways of meeting your needs. This information will only be used for the purpose of the survey, and will not be sold to others or used to market in any way.

**Sweepstakes:** email address, zip code, first and last name and other optional information. This information is used to contact you should you win our sweepstakes and, if you opt-in, to send you select offers we think you may benefit from.

**Vendor Sign-Up:** email address, address, phone number, URL, first and last name and company name. This information is used to contact potential vendors about inclusion on our site, and for ongoing contact should they become LMB vendors.

**Affiliate Program:** email address, address, phone number, URL, first and last name, company name, social security number, business tax classification and site information. This information is used to investigate affiliate opportunities, pay affiliates, and keep affiliates informed of important changes.

(In all cases where we collect a zip code, it is used for demographic analysis.)

Third Party Links  
When you sign-up for services on sites to which LowerMyBills.com provides links, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies.

Framed Pages  
In some instances, the LowerMyBills.com name and logo may appear on third party sites hosted by our partners. These partners will be collecting the information you provide during the sign-up process (this information will later be shared with LowerMyBills.com for tracking and customer service purposes). Please review our partners' privacy policies for more information.

Sharing  
Your information is never shared with third parties unless you "opt-in" to have such information shared. If we are given your express permission, we will periodically make your information available to reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find valuable. If you wish to prevent the transfer of your information to such companies, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com).

Accessing, Reviewing & Updating Your Information and Opting Out

When registering, you must specifically "opt-in" to have your information shared with third parties. Therefore, you can complete a transaction on LowerMyBills.com without receiving follow-up marketing materials.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional offers, you may "opt-out" of receiving these communications by replying to an email and typing "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or you can email us at [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com) (Our database is updated twice monthly.)  
  
Third Party Ad Servers  
We do not partner or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

Notification of Changes  
If there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email of the relevant changes. We will also post policy changes to LowerMyBills.com so that you can choose to opt out of these new uses.

Security  
LowerMyBills.com uses SSL-encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data on the site. We have partnered with [VeriSign](https://web.archive.org/misc/loading.jsp?LMBcategory=misc_gen&LMBfrom=privacy&LMBto=verisign.com&URL=http://www.verisign.com) to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

Email Links  
LowerMyBills.com uses email links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties only with your explicit permission.

Legal Disclaimer  
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on LowerMyBills.com.
