This is subject to the proviso that we may disclose your data to certain permitted third parties, such as our own professional advisors, who are bound by confidentiality codes, and when we are legally obliged to do so. We do not sell, rent or exchange your personal information with any third party for commercial reasons. 

When making a booking using an email address and postal address, you are giving us permission to send out marketing materials to you. We may also use the information to process any transactions and for internal analysis and administration. We retain and use your personal information to provide you with a personalised service and to give you details of offers which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish us to do so please let us know by sending us an email to [unsubscribe@lowcostholidays.com](mailto:unsubscribe@lowcostholidays.com).
