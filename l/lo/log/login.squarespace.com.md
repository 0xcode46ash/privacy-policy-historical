# Squarespace - Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Squarespace. Squarespace is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors. This privacy policy, part of our overall Terms of Service covers personally identifiable information shared through Squarespace' Service.

Squarespace takes your privacy seriously. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Squarespace Terms of Service policy. By using Squarespace, including services available at the squarespace.com domains, users are using a service provided by Squarespace, Inc. and they agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.

## What information does Squarespace collect and how do we use it?

When you register for Squarespace, we ask you for a login name, e-mail address, and password to secure your account. This information lets us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. After obtaining a Squarespace account, Squarespace will allow you to enter more personal information in order to uniquely customize your services. Providing this additional information is entirely optional, and will never be used by Squarespace, Inc. in ways other than the display of your website. 

Additionally, when accessing webpages on the Squarespace.com domain, the website you are accessing may log your IP Address as well as the time of your access, browser type, referral URLs, and the Squarespace login you are identified with at the time of access. Individual website owners have access to their own website access logs, much in the same way any server administrator has access to their website traffic logs. No information in this log can be identified back to your name by any Squarespace end user. Squarespace, Inc. itself does not reference these log elements to query any particular individual's usage of the Service. 

## How does Squarespace use cookies?

Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use Squarespace's services. 

## How does Squarespace use my personal information?

Squarespace uses your personal information to create a personal, managed, dynamic homepage for each of its members. Only information you mark as accessible will be presented to the public. Users may choose to opt-in to a public website directory, if they wish to have their website listed publically. If users do not opt in to this listing, no information related to a user's Squarespace account is made visible to external parties. Otherwise, basic information such as site name and account name may be visible in our directory. 

Squarespace also provides a unified login service wherein a user can identify him or herself within the context of a friend's website. In this situation, the website which you are identifiying yourself on will be able to see your login name, but no other information about you. Your real name and e-mail address are not exposed. 

## May I choose what information I disclose?

While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion. 

## How does Squarespace use the information collected from me?

We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your membership. 

## May I choose what communications I receive?

Along with your account registration email, we occasionally send out an email newsletter to Squarespace members to highlight features of the Service. You can elect not to receive communications from us or from other parties by noting your preference in response to communications from us. You must opt in to choose to be a part of this type of mailing, it will not be sent without your prior consent unless the mailing reflects an emergency change in policy, or notice regarding service interruption. We will also send email regarding billing issues and account de-activation. 

## What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?

We encourage Squarespace members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You can easily correct or update your personal information at any time via our perferences page or other location specifically identified in connection with a particular part of our Service. 

## Can I remove all of my data from the system? What data remains in your system after account deactivation?

While Squarespace will never present any personal information to the public that you have not configured it to display, your login - once registered - will always remain in your system. If you would like to have your login deactivated from the public, send an email to [registration@squarespace.com](mailto:registration@squarespace.com) to request a deletion. Once a login is deactivated, it remains in our system, but the email and data associated with that login are removed. Squarespace may periodically remove logins for deactivated accounts at its discretion. 

## What kind of security is used to protect my information?

We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard access controls. Secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures are in place that help us protect your data. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement. 

## Who has access to my information?

We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies (apart from those acting as our agents in providing our Service to you, who agree to use it only for that purpose), except as necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested, or unless you otherwise give us permission to do so. Squarespace may also share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. 

## What about sites Squarespace links to?

The Squarespace site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Squarespace, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than Squarespace, Inc., different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties. 

## What about other companies featured on Squarespace? 

You may separately agree to provide your information to other companies who provide content for various parts of our Service, in order to use their services, order their products, or receive offers from them. If you agree to provide information to these companies, that information will be subject to their privacy policies. 

## What about information posted on public site areas? 

Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, chat areas, file uploads, events, and listings - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. At times, Squarespace may take steps to ensure that your information, while issued to a public location, remains relatively secure. An example of this practice is the policy relating to the non-exposure of email addresses on public forums - Squaresace stores email addresses in locations that are not accessible to any users other than our Service mailers. 

## What about children's information? 

Children may not register for Squarespace or use any Squarespace services that require personally identifiable information. For questions about kids' privacy or other issues at Squarespace, please email [privacy@squarespace.com](mailto:privacy@squarespace.com). 

## Will I be notified if this agreement changes? How will I be notified?

If Squarespace changes its policy and seeks to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be notified via email or a system message visible on your Squarespace configuration page. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

## Who can I contact if I have any questions regarding my privacy? 

Please contact us directly at [privacy@squarespace.com](mailto:privacy@squarespace.com) with any questions or comments.
