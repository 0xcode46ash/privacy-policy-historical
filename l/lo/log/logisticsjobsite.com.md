****  
**** Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of WorkLife's network of sites and services, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

**Information Collection and Use by WorkLife**  
WorkLife is the sole owner of the personal information collected on our web sites. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. WorkLife collects information from our users at several different points on our web sites. Wherever we collect personal information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**Career Portals Powered by WorkLife**  
WorkLife provides career management services for various career portals on the Internet. When you REGISTER for any of the following career management services on a specific career portal "Powered by WorkLife" (such as careermag.com or the career development portions of VerticalNet's online industry marketplaces), your registration information may be shared with the owner of the specific career portal. The owner of the career portal shall maintain your registration information in accordance with its privacy policy.

**Web Sites and Newsletters**  
When you REGISTER with one of our sites or sign up to receive one of our newsletters, WorkLife may ask for your contact information (such as your email address) and your demographic information (such as your zip code, industry, and job function). We use demographic information to tailor your experience at our web site, showing you content and advertisements that we think might interest you. 

**Job Seeker Information** When you REGISTER for a job agent at our Web Site, you will be asked to provide certain information including your:   


  * e-mail address 
  * First and last name 
  * Zip code 
  * Industry of interest 
  * Career preference 



**Employers and Small Business Persons**  
When you REGISTER for a resume agent at our Web Site, you will be asked to provide with information including your:   


  * Password 
  * First and last name 
  * Job title 
  * Company name 
  * Industry 
  * Zip code  




**Resumes (If you are a Job Seeker)**  
Since WorkLife Solutions is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are several ways of doing this. 

  * You may store your resume in our database but not allow it to be searchable. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. 
  * Or, you can store it in our database and allow it to be searchable. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to paying recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. 

However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances. 

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, WorkLife will not disclose to any third party your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number without your prior consent, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. WorkLife reserves the right to offer third party services and products to you based on the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by WorkLife or by third parties.

We may send new registrants and subscribers a welcoming email. We ask our new subscribers in the welcoming email to then confirm their new subscription to the newsletter as a way of protecting them from unwanted emails. New members receive newsletters and product updates from WorkLife only if they follow the confirmation instructions in the welcoming email. If new members do not wish to receive such newsletters and updates, they do not need to take any action. 

Our web sites provide you with the choice to receive promotional emails from WorkLife and/or its partners. If you choose to receive promotional emails from WorkLife and/or its partners, you will be giving WorkLife permission to access your information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. We will not share your information with our partners unless you have opted in to receive promotional emails from such partners. If you have chosen to receive such emails and later change your mind, you can remove yourself from this distribution list via a link in the communication or by unsubscribing at this site. In addition to WorkLife, agents working on behalf of WorkLife under confidentiality agreements, and certain suppliers who are in contract with WorkLife, may send you carefully selected direct mailings about products and services that may be of interest to you. WorkLife does not control or monitor the newsletter or product updates sent by these suppliers. If you do not wish to receive these mailings, please notify us at [megan@worklife.com](mailto:megan@worklife.com). 

WorkLife may also ask for your information at other times, such as when you request information or when you decide to purchase products or services from WorkLife and/or our customers and suppliers. WorkLife will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described in this Privacy Statement, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of WorkLife. 

The information collected by WorkLife may be used in a number of ways. For example, WorkLife will share broad aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. An example would be where WorkLife provides partners and advertisers with information about the percentage of men or women who visit our sites, or about the types of industries that users come from. WorkLife's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about you, WorkLife is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you.  
  
**Third Party Advertising**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

**Orders**  
If you make a purchase through our site, the information obtained during your visit to the site, and the information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. In addition, this contact information is provided to third party suppliers and/or fulfillment agents that service your orders and requests. This contact information may also be provided to the suppliers of content for free downloads of white papers, software or other resources from any WorkLife websites. These third party suppliers, fulfillment agents and merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices, and WorkLife has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. **Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information associated with the user. We use cookies to be reminded of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register. Cookies are used on WorkLife web sites to help WorkLife track visits to and business at its store and process the items in your shopping basket. Cookies are also used to estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing WorkLife is given a unique cookie, which is then used to determine, repeat usage versus initial usage, and to help in targeting ads based on user interests. **Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser that does not contain any information about the user. **IP Addresses**  
We use IP addresses for purposes of system administration, and to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. **Links**  
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that WorkLife is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. **Tell an Associate**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. WorkLife will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. WorkLife stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. **Security**  
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. We use secure servers to protect all of your personal information, including your name, address, email and credit card information. It is generally considered safer than giving your information over the phone. We process your credit card number over our secure server that is the industry standard. Whenever we transmit any credit card information, we use a completely secure transmission method. In order to further protect your personal information, we store your credit card number in a separate location from your registration information. **Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. **Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. **Contact**
