# Logo Softwear - Online Privacy and Security

[Visit our NEW personalized PrintShop!](http://206.115.67.162/cgi-bin/EC/ecLocator2.cgi/a=06410LOG00)

At LogoSoftwear, one of our most important goals is to make your shopping experience as pleasurable, convenient, and worry-free as possible. For this reason, we have put in place firm privacy and security programs to keep our site safe and secure for all our visitors. 

All information gathered by logosoftwear.com remains private and will never be sold or shared with anyone. All information submitted to logosoftwear.com stays at logosoftwear.com. Maintaining your privacy is critical to us. 

Because Logosoftwear.com is an Internet retailer, security is also of utmost importance. We use the latest security methods and fraud detection techniques available to protect any and all information you give us. Because all credit card information transmitted online is encrypted in transit, it would be useless information should it be intercepted. We use all the latest technologies and will continue to implement improvements as new technologies become available. 

## Privacy

The personal information we receive from our customers is kept private--we do not sell or share this information with anyone outside of Logosoftwear.com. All information provided to Logosoftwear.com stays at Logosoftwear.com. 

On occasion, we e-mail newsletters or product specials of interest to customers who have purchased a particular product. If you are not interested in receiving these mailings, you can unsubscribe at any time by following unsubscribe procedure described in the e-mail. 

## Cookies

Have you heard a bit about `cookies' and wondered what they mean to your Web browser? Or have you been a bit curious about how we use cookies at Logosoftwear.com? Well, the answers are pretty simple. A cookie is a small bit of text used by a browser to store information. When you visit a site that uses cookies, the Web server will request permission to pass a cookie to your browser. If accepted, it will occupy only a few bytes on your hard drive and can improve your Web surfing experience. 

Logosoftwear.com uses cookies to track customer visits through our site. This information enables us to evaluate shopping trends and predict demand for products so that we can do a better job of stocking the items you want. Cookies also provide a smoother shopping experience by helping us to uniquely identify shopping carts. 

Cookies can not profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. And although you may receive cookies from many different sites, each cookie can only be read by the Web server that originally issued it. At Logosoftwear.com, we do not use cookies to store credit card numbers or any other personal identification. You aren't even identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you come to our site - a sort of Logosoftwear.com identity.
