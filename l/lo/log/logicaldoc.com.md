# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At LogicalDOC we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact us](mailto:contact@logicaldoc.com). LogicalDOC operates several websites, including [logicaldoc.com](https://www.logicaldoc.com/), [forums.logicaldoc.com](http://forums.logicaldoc.com/), [docs.logicaldoc.com, ](http://docs.logicaldoc.com/)[blog.logicaldoc.com](http://blog.logicaldoc.com/), [issues.logicaldoc.com](http://issues.logicaldoc.com/). It is LogicalDOC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

  
**Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, LogicalDOC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LogicalDOC’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how LogicalDOC’s visitors use its website. From time to time, LogicalDOC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. LogicalDOC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. LogicalDOC only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

  
**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to LogicalDOC’s websites choose to interact with LogicalDOC in ways that require LogicalDOC to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that LogicalDOC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a free trial of LogicalDOC Online Services and LogicalDOC Studio to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with LogicalDOC are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those transactions. In each case, LogicalDOC collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with LogicalDOC. LogicalDOC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

  
**Aggregated Statistics**  
LogicalDOC may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, LogicalDOC may monitor the most popular blogs on the site. LogicalDOC may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, LogicalDOC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

  
**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**  
LogicalDOC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on LogicalDOC’s behalf or to provide services available at LogicalDOC’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using LogicalDOC’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LogicalDOC will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, LogicalDOC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when LogicalDOC believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of LogicalDOC, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an LogicalDOC website and have supplied your email address, LogicalDOC may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with LogicalDOC and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. LogicalDOC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

  
**Cookies**  
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. LogicalDOC uses cookies to help LogicalDOC identify and track visitors, their usage of LogicalDOC website, and their website access preferences. LogicalDOC visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using LogicalDOC’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of LogicalDOC’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. They can also opt out analytics cookies by [clicking here](https://www.logicaldoc.com/privacy-policy#aaa).

You opted out analytics cookies. Former cookies were already deleted.

  
**Business Transfers**  
If LogicalDOC, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that LogicalDOC goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of LogicalDOC may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

  
**Ads**  
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by LogicalDOC and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

  
**Privacy Policy Changes**  
Although most changes are likely to be minor, LogicalDOC may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in LogicalDOC’s sole discretion. LogicalDOC encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. This privacy policy was adapted from that of [automattic.com](https://automattic.com/privacy/), which was posted under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) license.
