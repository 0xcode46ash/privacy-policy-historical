###  Web Services Users and Web Site Visitors

Like most Web services operators, Loggly collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Loggly’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Loggly’s visitors use its website and services. From time to time, Loggly may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and services.

Loggly also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Loggly does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information other than under the circumstances described below.

###  Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Loggly’s websites and services choose to interact with Loggly in ways that require Loggly to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Loggly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of the Loggly application to provide a username and email address. In each case, Loggly collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Loggly. Loggly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.

###  Aggregated Statistics

Loggly may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and service. For instance, Loggly may reveal aggregate data on how much log data an average customer collects, or what the most common search terms used are across all customers. However, Loggly does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

###  Log Data

Loggly collects, aggregates, and stores log and audit data for its customers. Loggly in turn will not disclose individual log records other than aggregates as described above or for the purposes described below.

###  Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Loggly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Loggly’s behalf or to provide services available at Loggly’s service, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Loggly’s services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Loggly will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Loggly discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Loggly believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Loggly, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Loggly service and have supplied your email address, Loggly may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Loggly and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Loggly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
