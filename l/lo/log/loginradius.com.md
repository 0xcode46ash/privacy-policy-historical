We are respectful of the privacy concerns of visitors and users of the website www.loginradius.com.

**General Policy:** As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors and users of LoginRadius. However, certain non-personal information about visitors is recorded by the standard operation of LoginRadius’s Internet servers. This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for both visitors and registered users. Using this information, web pages optimized for a particular visitor's computer may be automatically made available to that visitor. Other use of this information may include internal review of the number of visitors to this website but only in the aggregate sense and in a non-personally-identifiable form.

These measures include an electronic firewall and various other protection measures that involve virus scanning, installation of security patches, vulnerability testing, backup and recovery planning, employee training, security audits and other steps designed to constantly improve the data protection posture. The server is not directly connected to the Internet and data is therefore available only to authorized computers.
