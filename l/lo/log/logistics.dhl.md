This data is stored in HTML5 Local Storage, with one entry per campaign. The key of this field is “usbl.c. **ID** ” where ID is a unique id for the campaign.

These two pieces of data are needed to determine if a user is new or returning. If you want to know more about Usabilla's cookie policy, please check:

##  Additional Information 

**Sharing Tools: Third Party Cookies**

DHL now uses embedded ‘share’ buttons on its websites. These make it easy for visitors to bookmark and share content through their favourite social networks. When you click on one of these buttons, a cookie may be set by the service you have chosen to share content through. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and you should therefore check the relevant third party’s website for more information.

The ‘share buttons’ are provided by AddThis. For more information about their data collection practices, please take a look at the [AddThis Privacy Policy](http://www.addthis.com/tos)

**Third Party Cookies in embedded content**

Please note that on some pages of our websites you may notice that cookies have been set that are not related to DHL. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Vimeo, these service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. You should check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.

**Web Beacons**

In order to keep DHL’s online content relevant, easy to use and up-to-date, we use web analytics services such as Webtrends* to help us understand how people use our websites. These services use data collection technologies such as web beacons. Web beacons are small electronic images that deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and website effectiveness. In turn, this lets us know what content is of interest to our visitors and helps us provide tailored information on our websites. These web beacons are anonymous and do not contain or collect any information that identifies you.

The information is anonymous and only used for statistical purposes. Web analytics data and cookies cannot be used to identify you as they never contain personal information such as your name or email address.
