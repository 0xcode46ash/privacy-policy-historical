# Privacy Policy

LogsHero Ltd. (“LogsHero”, “We” or “Us”) provides this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from Users of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy only applies to the Website, services and applications included within “Services” and does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use. Please note that the term “you” also includes the company which is our customer and for which you are accepting the Terms of Use.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account if applicable) and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

**Account Information.** When you create an Account, we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as name, email address, postal address, username, phone number, billing information and the name of the company for which you are accepting these terms, as applicable (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We may also collect certain information that is not Personally Identifiable Information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. Please note that your billing information, to the extent provided by you, is forwarded directly to a third party billing and/or clearing service/company engaged by Us, and is not kept by Us. LogsHero will not share, rent or sell Personally Identifying Information to any third party, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**User Data.** In order to perform our Services, we may also collect from you data that you have sent to us (“User Data”) via electronic means to Internet addresses that we provide to you. Such User Data may include records of operations of your applications and systems and other information relating to your actions. LogsHero will never share your User Data with other Users or with any other third party, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. However, LogsHero reserves the right to analyze User Data in order to provide its Services to you and improve its Services. LogsHero reserves the right to disclose anonymized and/or aggregated versions of the User Data to third parties in connection with the use, development, improvement and marketing of the Services, provided that such anonymized or aggregated User Data shall not personally identify you. We may create statistical, aggregated data relating to our users and the Website for analytical purposes and offer such data to our users and other third parties. Aggregated data may be derived from User Data, or other Data but in its aggregated and anonymized form that will not identify any individual. This data is used to understand our users needs and to develop, improve and market the Service.

**Use of Services.** Our servers automatically record certain information about how a User uses our Services (“Log Data”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non Personally Identifiable Information about how the Services are used.

**User Support.** If you are a User with an Account, LogsHero may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with LogsHero and our products and services. If you send us a request, we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other Users.

**Cookies.** We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access the Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
LogsHero may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in LogsHero’s sole discretion. Any information that We collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. LogsHero encourages Users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If We make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, We will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and We will indicate when such changes will become effective. Your continued use of the Website and/or Services after we have notified you of any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
**Service Providers.** We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third party services providers have access to your Personally Identifiable Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. Some of these service providers may be located outside of your home country; by using the Services, you consent to the transfer of such Personally Identifiable Information to such third party services providers.

**User Forums.** As part of the Services, Users may communicate with other Users in User forums (“Forum Information”). “Forum Information” may consist of, for example, User comments regarding and tips for utilizing the Services. Such Forum Information may be collected and analyzed by LogsHero for the purpose of providing the Services and supporting you or other Users. Other Users will see your “User Name” when you participate in a Users forum. Providing other Users with any information on a Users forum is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with the other Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information so that you do not allow others to identify you.

**Compliance with Laws.** We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as We, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of LogsHero or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

**Transfer of Personally Identifiable Information.** In the event We are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed, transferred or assigned to the third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

**Publicity.** We may use your Personally-Identifiable Information for the purpose of solely identifying you as a LogsHero customer on the Website, client lists, press releases and/or other marketing documents.

**Security**  
We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personally Identifiable Information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personally Identifiable Information despite our efforts. You should note that in using our Services, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. While We do not require Users to send their User Data to us via encrypted transit, we encourage all Users to do so.

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other Users of the Website. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other Users.

**Changing or Deleting Personally Identifying Information**  
If you, as a User, would like to update, correct or delete the Personally Identifying Information in your registration profile, you may do so by contacting us at support@logz.io. If you request a deletion of such information, your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We have the right to retain an archived copy of your Personally Identifying Information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

**International Transfer**  
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your Personally Identifiable Information to us, we may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, as represented by your continued use of the Website and/or Services, followed by your submission of any Personally Identifying Information represents your agreement to that transfer.

**Privacy of Children**  
Our Website is not directed to persons under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifying Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
