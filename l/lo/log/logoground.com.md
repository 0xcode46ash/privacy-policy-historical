Designers who participate on LogoGround are not employed by LogoGround and we cannot control their use of client information. When you provide information to a designer or any other member of the site, you do so without any guarantee of privacy unless such guarantee is offered by the member themselves.

When you register as a seller on LogoGround you are required to supply your real name and surname for the purpose of copyright transfer in the event of a sale. Your name and surname will be displayed publicly. We require a working email address so that your account details and sales notifications can be delivered to you. And lastly we require payment information, such as a PayPal email address, so that proceeds from sales may be paid over to you.
