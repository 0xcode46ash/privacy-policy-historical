**What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**

LogoSportswear.com does not sell or rent user information to anyone. Your LogoSportswear.com account information is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your LogoSportswear.com account information by using your LogoSportswear.com ID and password. There are several places on LogoSportswear.com where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. LogoSportswear.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your LogoSportswear.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, LogoSportswear.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**

Email Address: We do not sell our email addresses to others and it will be shared only with the company who sends our e-mails out. Our customers and prospects may receive occasional e-mails to announce new products, features and technical updates. If you prefer to have your name withheld, simply email us at [Legal@LogoSportswear.com](mailto:legal@LogoSportswear.com), and ask us to remove your address from our emailings. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [Legal@LogoSportswear.com](mailto:legal@LogoSportswear.com). Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
