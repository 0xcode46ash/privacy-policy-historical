Lorna Jane may collect personal information about you from a third party source. We will take reasonable steps to contact you and make you aware of the purposes for which we have collected your personal information which has been obtained from a third party source.  
Customers under 18  
We are mindful that some customers who register as members may be under the age of 18. In the interests of their personal safety, we urge children to check with their parents before providing us with any personal information and ask parents to discuss these issues with their children. Lorna Jane will also ensure that appropriate disclosures are made at the time of collection of other information from minors, and will only collect this information where it is appropriate to do so.  
Personal information about other people  
You must not provide personal information to Lorna Jane about another person, unless that person has authorised us, through you, to collect, use and disclose personal information about that person for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

We use your personal information for the primary purpose for which it has been provided, or for purposes related to or ancillary to that primary purpose, that is, for the purposes of you becoming a registered user of the website and any other purposes outlined above as nominated or requested by you.  
By providing us with your personal information, you agree to receive communications from Lorna Jane or our agencies, contractors, related companies and promotional partners. You may choose to opt out of receiving these communications and we will give you the opportunity to do that each time we contact you, except in the instance where receipt of the communications are essential to the participation in a competition.

4\. Disclosure of information

We will not rent, trade, spam or sell any personally identifiable information that you give us to any third party unless we receive your prior consent. However, when you register you may opt in to receive information about special promotional offers from some of our promotional partners.  
Lorna Jane may from time to time engage third party contractors to carry out work. Third party contractors are prohibited from using collected personal information about you, except for the specific purpose for which that personal information has been supplied by Lorna Jane to the contractor.  
Your personal information is only provided to third parties where required by law or to our agencies, contractors, related companies and promotional partners where they require your information for the purposes of the promotion or to contact you with special offers. In such cases we have taken steps to ensure that any third party access to personal information complies with the NPPs.

Lorna Jane will not transfer your personal information to foreign countries without your express or implied consent.
