 _COOKIES_

 **What are they?**

A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your device so that the website can remember who you are. 

We use cookies to help you navigate our website efficiently and to perform certain functions, including site traffic analysis. Cookies may also recognize you on your next log-in and offer you content tailored to your preferences and interests. Cookies do not compromise the security of a website.

Some cookies can collect personal information, including information you disclose like your username, or where cookies track you to deliver more relevant advertising content. For further details on how we use your personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.

There are two types of cookies on our sites – “session” cookies that are temporary cookies that remain on your browser only while you’re on our site, and “persistent” cookies, that remain on your browser for much longer.

 **Do I want to stop them?**

Many cookies are used to enhance the usability or functionality of a website; therefore disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain parts of this website. We explain the cookies we use in the table below and give you a button by which you can block the optional cookies.

 **If you do not make either choice then you will be treated as having accepted all cookies on this site.   You can change your mind in subsequent visits and use the buttons below, or the tool available on the relevant L’Oréal website that you are using, to change your cookie status for our site.**

If you wish to restrict or block all the cookies which are set by our website (which as we say may prevent you from using certain parts of the site), or indeed any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. For more information go to [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)

 **Which cookies are being used on this site?**

We use three types of cookies on this site – those that are strictly necessary for the website to function, functionality cookies, performance and analytics cookies, and targeted/advertising cookies.

 _ _Strictly Necessary cookies:__ These are cookies that may be required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, or for a shopping cart function. These cookies cannot be switched off.

 _ _Functionality cookies:__ These cookies are used to enhance and simplify your user experience. For example, they may record information about previous choices you have made, remember your password, or allow video or social media content to be properly viewed on the website. You can opt out of functionality cookies using the function below.

 _ _Analytics and Performance cookies:__ These are used for internal purposes to help us provide you with an improved user experience e.g. to assess the performance of a website, or to test different design ideas for the website. We often work with third party research companies to perform these services for us, so these cookies may be set by a third party. Third party cookies and analytics or performance cookies are set out in the list below. You can opt out of them using the function below.

 _ _Targeting and advertising cookies:__ These cookies are used to deliver relevant and tailored content (including advertising content) to you, and also to evaluate the effectiveness of that content. This content may be delivered on our websites, or on a third party website. We often work with third parties to deliver this content, so some of these cookies may be set by a third party. You can opt out of them using the function below. You can also opt out of targeted advertising by clicking on the “Ad Choices” logo on our advertising, or at <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>. Note however by opting out of these cookies you do not opt out of receiving advertising content altogether; you will instead receive general content that does not take into account your interests and preferences.

We also use [web beacons](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/web-beacons/) in combination with cookies.

Where we work with third parties, they may set cookies to deliver the services that they are providing (e.g. tailored advertising). We make every effort to identify these cookies and detail them below, so that you can choose to opt out.

There may be additional cookies managed by third parties, for example:

 **a)      ****_Social Media Networks and Third Party Content_** **.** On our website we may use social networking icons and sometimes embed video content from websites such as YouTube. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube, or click on a social network icon that takes you to a that social network, you will be presented with third party cookies from Youtube or that site as applicable. We do not control these cookies and you need to check with the applicable third party website for more information.

 ** _If you wish to change you cookie settings, please use the function below for this website, or the tool available on the relevant L’Oréal website that you are using:_**
