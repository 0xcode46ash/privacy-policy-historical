# Privacy Policy | Loaded | The Original Men's Magazine

Simian Publishing Limited is committed to protecting your privacy.

We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the data we collect.

**1\. What Information We Collect**

Simian Publishing Limited collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you visit loaded.co.uk, our social media sites and when you contact us.

“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify you for example, your name, address or telephone number as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to, or could be linked to, any of the foregoing data.

“Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individuals.

**2\. How We Collect Personal Data**

We collect Personal Data from you such as your name and contact details when you register on our site or when you choose to use the various services we provide.

We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, for instance, when you enter a competition. If you provide us feedback regarding our site or services via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply.

In order to improve our services to you, we may ask you to voluntarily complete confidential surveys. We do not ask you to provide us any personally identifiable data in association with these surveys although we do associate your responses with Personal Data.

**3\. How The Information Is Used**

Simian Publishing Limited uses your Personal Data to provide you with a customised Web experience and to provide services to you. Such services include sending you marketing messages if you have given us permission to do so and processing your responses to competitions.

We also use Personal Data for customer service messages, and to notify you about updates to our services and to respond to your requests. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

We use this Anonymous Data to perform statistical analyses of users’ aggregate behaviour so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. Simian Publishing Limited reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at its discretion, in aggregate form.

If you elect to receive communications from us we may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site and may contain advertisements for third parties.

**  4\. Keeping Details Up To Date & Marketing Communications**

Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your Personal Data to provide us with your most current e-mail and postal address. In the event that the last e-mail or postal address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our despatch containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. When you register to our site or respond to one of our communications, we will ask you if you want to receive future communications from us.

You may indicate consent to receipt of these communications by entering your personal details and choosing what information you would like to receive, or by not ticking the opt-out box provided. Should you decide to stop receiving further communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive.

**5\. External Websites**

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Policy only Simian Publishing Limited and its affiliate companies collect Personal Data through the services provided solely by Simian Publishing Limited; this Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use our services.

When you click on advertisements or links on loaded.co.uk, you will leave that site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you, such as the URL you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your IP address.

**6\. Social Media & Other Third Parties**

We work with trusted third parties, including social network sites such as Facebook. Other social networks we use include Twitter, You Tube and Instagram – all of these companies operate Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products and services among members of your social networks and to allow you to share products and service interests with your network.

We cannot control how your data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Sites or to whom it is disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on relevant social networking sites.

**7\. How Personal Data Is Kept Secure**

Your Personal Data may be processed both in and outside of your own country. When you submit your details and in whichever country you are situated you agree to the data being transferred to the UK and processed under the terms of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. Simian Publishing Limited and affiliates are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure.

Even though Simian Publishing Limited takes significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorised persons, you should know that Simian Publishing Limited cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.

**8\. Access To Personal Data**

You are entitled to see the information held about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to see the information that we hold about you, please contact us in writing: 23 – 24 Margaret Street, London, W1W 8RU. We reserve the right to charge a statutory fee of £10 for this service and we are legally obliged to request identification to demonstrate that you are entitled to receive the requested data.

**9\. Questions Regarding This Policy**

**10\. Changes To This Policy**

This Privacy Policy will be reviewed on a regular basis.
