PRIVACY  
MeridianLink values your right and your customers' right to privacy. We are committed to keeping personal identifying and company identifying information safe, secure and confidential. The information we request from you will be used strictly for the purposes of processing your request and contacting you for corrections that may be needed to process your request. Only by law do we disclose your information. 

MeridianLink does not resell or share with other companies or entities any personal identifying, corporate identifying, or demographic information gained through this process in any way, except by our characterizations of types of companies or participants in the aggregate. MeridianLink does use this demographic and contact information for its own, internal communications and marketing efforts unless you specifically choose otherwise. 

We do not sell or share email addresses or any other visitor information with third parties. E-mail addresses and other volunteered information are kept confidential. 

DATA COLLECTION  
To monitor system activities for malicious acts, MeridianLink logs all activities performed on its systems and periodically check the log files for irregularities. This measure ensures the early detection of illegal activities and possible equipment failure. Additionally, it helps help us evaluate our hardware setup and ensures that we keep our components current and our system operating at peak levels. When used in the course of scientific or research purposes, all reasonable identifying information in the logs are removed. 

SECURITY  
MeridianLink is certified by TruSecure, a security assurance company. This means that we have taken every known precaution to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, every user is responsible for his or her login/password and for any misuse of it. Confidential information is encrypted when transmitted to and from our systems. Two firewalls are in place as an extra precaution against hack attacks from the internal and external network. 

IN SUMMARY  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing reliable services. We use the information we collect on our systems only to provide better service and to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
