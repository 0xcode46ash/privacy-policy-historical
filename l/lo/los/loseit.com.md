No personally identifiable information will be shared with any third party without your consent.

We will treat the information we collect as confidential. We will not share Personally Identifiable Information about you without your consent. We may share information collected from you that does not identify you or an individual with third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners. For example, we may disclose the total number of pounds lost by all Lose It! users, the average weight loss of Lose It! users, or generalized information about diet and exercise habits based on aggregated statistics developed from collected data.

We may also use share data that does not identify a user:

  * To fulfill the services and products you request from us.

  * For internal purposes, which may require the transfer of such information to other Lose It! affiliates for administrative purposes, for technical maintenance purposes, the marketing and promotion of products and services that might be of interest to you.



We may disclose your personal information (including Genetic Information) when we reasonably believe that it is required by law, a duly authorized court order, or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of Lose It!, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. If we are required to disclose your information, we will attempt to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law.

In the event Lose It! goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information and Personal Diet Data will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. We will require as a term of such transition that the entity acquiring users’ personal information and Personal Diet Data treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In some circumstances we may use third party contractors to perform these services on our behalf. In such circumstances, we will only provide the contractor with the information needed to perform the services (for example, name and address if a contractor is delivering a product to you), and all contractors will be required to agree to confidentiality obligations with respect to your personal information.

**Apple HealthKit**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lose It! will not use or disclose to third parties user data gathered from the Apple, Inc.

Please bear in mind that Lose It! cannot control what your friends or Coaches do with the information you share with them, so you should only share with friends and Coaches you trust.

When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation) and legally mandated notices.

**Security of the Information We Collect**

We take commercially reasonable precautions in an effort to protect your information against security breaches.

_Cookies._ When you visit the Websites, a cookie may be saved on your computer (if your computer accepts cookies), and if you return to the Websites the cookie may be read. A “cookie,” is a small text file placed on the user's hard drive to track usage of the Websites and collect basic information, which may include certain of your preferences.   
We use cookies to gain knowledge of Internet usage, improve content and advertisements, collect the site visitation data described above and in some cases to deliver specialized content.

We may also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. Data collected through this mechanism is not linked to personal information. A web beacon is an electronic image and string of code that is imbedded in a web page or email which allows us to track web page views/hits or the opening of an email containing a beacon.

**DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE**

Lose It! does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may be able to set the DNT signal so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

Third parties that have content embedded on the Websites or App such as a social feature may set cookies on a user's browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Websites from a certain IP address.
