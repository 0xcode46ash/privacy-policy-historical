[](https://www.truste.org/validate/5423) This confirms that Lockergnome is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Lockergnome.com. 

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: 

  * What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site 
  * The organization collecting the information 
  * How the information is used 
  * With whom the information may be shared 
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 
  * The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Lockergnome control 
  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [Chris Pirillo](mailto:chris@lockergnome.com?subject=Lockergnome%20Privacy%20Statement). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. 

Lockergnome LLC has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our Web site and newsletters: Lockergnome.com. 

  
Security  
Lockergnome has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have firewalls set up for both our Web and list servers. Our Web server is hosted by Digitaldaze.com in California, and our List server is currently being hosted by Apexmail.com in British Columbia, Canada. 

  
Logs  
Lockergnome runs a web server that does compile a log file of visitors to our site. This collects the same standard stuff that most web server software does. This includes the type of browser you are using, your IP addresses, incoming domain, time, date, pages viewed, and length of time that you spend visiting our site. 

  
IP Freely  
We use a visitor's IP address to help diagnose possible problems encountered on our Web server. If there is a future contention, then we have records on hand. An IP address may be used to gather broad demographic information -- although this information is kept for internal use only. 

  
Cookie Jar  
We use external organizations to display advertisements on our site and in our newsletters. While we may use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies sent via banner ads are collected by the given ad agency; we do not have access to this information. 

  
Subscribing Safely  
Lockergnome's initial registration form requires users to give us an e-mail address. This is used only for the distribution of our HTML and/or text-based e-mail newsletters. This personal data is never shared with an outside party, and the subscriber database is never used for purposes other than for distributing the requested newsletter(s). We do not purchase outside lists to build the Lockergnome subscriber databases; you must fill out a form in order to join our family. 

  
Unsubscribing Safely  
Users may unsubscribe at any time. The databases for the HTML Daily and Text Weekly Digest are separate. The user will need to unsubscribe from one or the other (or both) to stop receiving future mailings from our organization. To be removed from our database, the user must e-mail a specially coded e-mail address sent to them with the most recent issue. These unsubscribing procedures provided via the Lyris list software are failsafe. NOTE: there is no unsubscription form on our site, only because it's more convenient for someone to see a newsletter they no longer want, click a link within it, and then be unsubscribed without having to fire up their Web browser. If that doesn't work, just blast a message to subscriptions@lockergnome.com for further assistance. 

The great thing about our list software is the user can see his/her subscribed address -- if someone wishes to be removed from our list(s), we will take every step necessary to get them removed. Of course, we'd like to hope that this would never happen... 

  
Updating Safely  
To change one's subscribed e-mail address, one simply must unsubscribe and then resubscribe (either at the Lockergnome Web site or through a presented e-mail link). For further subscription queries, e-mail should be sent to subscriptions@lockergnome.com. 

  
The Missing Link  
Our site and newsletter contain links to other sites. Lockergnome.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Web destinations. 

  
You've Won  
For contests, we may ask visitors for contact information (name, address, phone number) and/or demographic information (postal code, occupation, or interests). The customer's contact information is used to contact him or her when e-mail does not work. What do we use this data for? Well, sometimes sponsors want to know what kind of audience our newsletter tends to attract. We only analyze group numbers -- never singling out an individual's preferences or background. 

  
Telling a friend  
You will notice that you can click “tell a friend about Lockergnome” on certain parts of our site. Rest assured that we do not keep their e-mail address or store it in any way if they do not subscribe. The form simply sends them an invitation to join Lockergnome. IP addresses are logged and transfered only to stop possible misuse. 

  
Family Room  
We make newsgroups available to our users at [news.lockergnome.com](news://news.lockergnome.com/). Please remember that any information disclosed in this area becomes public information; one should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information therein. Same goes for the Lockergnome chat room. 

  
Changes to this policy  
If we make any changes to this policy, you will be the first to know; we'll announce any major updates in the newsletter. We don’t intend on ever giving out your information to a third party; if for some reason we need to do so, you will be contacted directly and asked for your permission. But, honestly, I'd rather rip out my intestines with a fork.
