We created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and use the Websites, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Websites, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Websites or any websites of the partners of Localytics, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, all Optional Information that you provide us will be deemed Personal Information.

When you send e-mail or other communications to Localytics, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 

Storage

We store all Traffic Data and review postings indefinitely, even after "deletion," and may archive such information elsewhere. We store all Personal Information until you request that we modify or delete it, in which case we may still wind up retaining some of that information for the reasons described in the Section below entitled “Controlling Your Personal Information”. In addition, we may store certain information and data about your end users that is sent to our servers from one of the Localytics “Client Libraries” that may be integrated into your application(s) (“End User Information”). Such End User Information is stored only on an aggregate, anonymized (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis and will be made available to you for your analysis. 

Information Sharing

Localytics does not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with any third parties except in the following limited circumstances: 

  * We have your express consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any Personal Information.
  * To our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted business partners (“Partners”) for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf, but only to provide the requested Services and subject to this Privacy Policy. Such Partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Localytics and to provide your requested services.
  * In the event of a merger, sale or acquisition by or of Localytics. In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



User Choice

You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Websites; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Websites that require your Personal Information. 

Confidentiality and Security

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of Localytics or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties. 

Information Security and Data Integrity

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law. 

Lost or Stolen Information

You must promptly notify us if your Personal Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that Personal Information from your account and update our records accordingly. 

Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy

If changes are significant we will post a notice on our website or send you an email. Information collected will be subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection.
