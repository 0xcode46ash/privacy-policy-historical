Localyte may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Localyte Terms of Use. Localyte may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Localyte's Copyright Policy, as Localyte in Localyte's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

Localyte will transfer information about you if Localyte is acquired by or merged with another company.

Pursuant to Localyte's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Localyte-related communications or for Localyte-facilitated transactions. Localyte has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Localyte user to your email or physical mail list.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Localyte's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Localyte will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Localyte believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Localyte's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.
