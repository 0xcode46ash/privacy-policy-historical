This policy covers our use of personal information that we may collect when you use the Site. The Site uses cookies for the purposes of collecting certain limited information, which will be used as described within this policy. If you do not wish such information to be collected then you may reject the cookies.

From time to time, you may be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address) in order to receive or use services on our website. Such services may include alerts, recommendations, and Site membership.

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us and our service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. When using your personal information we will act in accordance with current legislation and aim to meet current Internet best practice.

Where we collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and similar information, as provided by you then we shall only use it for those purposes consistent with these terms.

The information we gather may be used for the following general purposes: 

  1. To customize any advertising and the content you see; 
  2. To enhance the user experience; 
  3. To fulfil certain requests that you may make from time to time; 
  4. To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you;
  5. For complying with certain legal obligations.



We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:

  1. You have elected to allow us to share that information at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our website; or
  2. When required by law, such as when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or when we believe your actions may be infringing any applicable law.



We aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by our sites without registering.

We also give users the following options: 

  1. Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters or those of third parties when registering. Users who opt in may remove themselves from mailing lists at any time through the subscription-management pages or by following the instructions at the end of the e-mail they received from us; 
  2. Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site, provided, however, that you may not be able to use some of the service without providing us with certain information.



You may review, correct, or change the information collected during registration. The instructions for doing this may be identified on the site. Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with our services or who have questions may contact us using e-mail address identified on the site.
