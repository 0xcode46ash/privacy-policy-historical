## Statement from Our Team

As avid users of technology and the web, we understand your desire to have your privacy respected.

## Information Collection and Use

### Non Personally Identifiable Information

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This information includes but is not limited to: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We currently use Google Analytics for this functionality. You can read their privacy policy [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

### Registration

We collect minimal personally identifiable information when you register for an account. We will never share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless we give you prior notice and you make the choice to do so.

The information that we collect includes an email address, username, and password. It is your responsibility to provide an accurate email address and a secure password. Usernames are collected for the sole purpose of creating a friendly user experience (i.e. personalized pages and emails) and as a unique user Log In. Email addresses are collected for the purpose of emailing notifications to users. To gather information about site usage, we track track the frequency of your log-ins to the site. For your security we encrypt your passwords in our database so that even we are unable to view them.

During sign up, you have the option to opt-in to a daily email newsletter. You can change this preference at any time in the Settings section of your account. From time to time we may also send out emails related to your subscription status, the status of the website, or other business announcements. You can opt out of these emails by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. 

### Account Security

If you feel your password has been jeopardized, you may change your password at any time, and as frequently as you wish by accessing the Settings page after you've logged in. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. LockerPulse can not and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with these security obligations.
