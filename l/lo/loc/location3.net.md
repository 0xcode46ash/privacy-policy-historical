# Privacy Policy | Location3 Media

Location3 Media, Inc. (“Location3”) partners with national brands to increase their findability and performance across all digital platforms. By leveraging elite certifications and industry-leading experience, we help companies create efficient and effective online marketing campaigns that fit our clients’ needs and deliver results. Since Location3 considers your privacy a serious matter, we have implemented measures designed to protect your personal information, as set forth in our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy governs your interactions with our website and your use of our online services.

Please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with our Privacy Policy, which explains what information our website gathers and how it is and is not used.

## The Types of Information We Gather

Our website gathers two types of information about its users, personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information includes, for example, your first and last name, street address, e-mail address and telephone number. We may collect personally identifiable information about you through various means. For example, you may directly provide us with personally identifiable information when contacting us via the “Contact” page of our website. We may also collect personally identifiable information about you by logging your IP address if your ISP statically assigns your IP address.

Please note that we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from minors younger than 13 years of age. By providing us with personally identifiable information, you are representing that the person whose information you are providing is not a minor. If you are a minor, please have a parent or guardian review this policy and request any information you are seeking on your behalf.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

In addition to the personally identifiable information that you may voluntarily provide, our website utilizes “cookies” to collect anonymous data about our website. A “cookie” is a small piece of data or data files, which is sent to your computer’s browser, by a website, and subsequently stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are used for statistical tracking purposes and not for individual identification. For example, cookies are used to understand general traffic patterns of a website, including how many visitors access a website, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages of the website were visited. We use this anonymous data, and may share it with third parties, in order to improve the content and functionality of our website, to better understand the needs and interests of our visitors, and to improve our programs and services.  
Please note that you may configure your browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. However, in order for certain applications on our website to function properly, if at all, it may be necessary for your computer to accept cookies. As each browser is different, please check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie and privacy preferences.

## How We Use (And Do Not Use) The Information We Gather

Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy, we do not release personally identifiable information gathered through our website without your permission. Furthermore, we will not provide your personally identifiable information we collect to third parties, except to those who may assist us in processing your requests for information. Please note that you may always choose not to provide your personally identifiable information to us by, either, not purchasing our services or otherwise providing us with such information. If you do, however, voluntarily provide us with your personally identifiable information, we may use it to contact you regarding Location3 and the services that we offer.

Please note that we reserve the right to release personally identifiable information contained within our access logs concerning any visitor to our website that we reasonably believe has participated in any illegal activity. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to do so in order to comply with our legal obligations.

As mentioned above, we use non-personally identifiable information to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of visitors to our website. We may provide statistical information based on this data to current and potential business partners. Additionally, if we sell or transfer some or all of our company assets, we may sell or transfer non-personally identifiable information as part of such transaction.
