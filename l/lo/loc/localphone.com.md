# Our Privacy Policy | Localphone

## Localphone Privacy Policy

Localphone respects the privacy of its customers and takes protecting the privacy of its customers seriously. This policy briefly describes the personally identifiable information that Localphone collects from its customers and prospective customers and the steps that it takes to safeguard such information.

## Collection and Use of Information

Localphone collects and uses personally identifiable information—such as name, email address, and credit card information—for billing and provisioning of service, to solve problems associated with service, and to inform customers and prospective customers of new Localphone products or services that will better meet their needs. Localphone may also collect such information from prospective customers through promotional campaigns it may occasionally conduct. Localphone may share such information with business partners to ensure the successful provisioning and operation of its services and to facilitate the marketing of Localphone products and services. However, Localphone does not sell, trade, or disclose personally identifiable information to third parties for unrelated marketing purposes. In addition, any customer who wishes not to receive information about new or different Localphone products or services may decline to receive such offers.

Localphone utilises “cookies” in its information gathering process in order to improve the quality of the Localphone web-site and as well as the quality of customer interaction with Localphone throughout the ordering, provisioning, and billing process. Customers may choose to block the use of such “cookies”, though that will make interaction with Localphone less efficient and could limit the availability of certain web-site features.

## Security

Localphone has invested in and deployed a variety of technology and security features to protect the privacy of customer information on its network. In addition, Localphone has implemented operational guidelines to safeguard customer privacy throughout the company. Localphone will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as the emergence of new technologies warrant.

## Account Information

Each customer is responsible for ensuring that the customer’s account information on file with Localphone is accurate and current. Customers may access their account information through the log-in procedure on the Localphone web-site or by contacting the customer support centre.

## Children’s Privacy Policy

Localphone does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Localphone does not knowingly solicit or collect customer identifiable information from minors under the age of eighteen. In addition, Localphone will not knowingly link to any third party web site that solicits or collects customer identifiable information from minors. If you believe that a minor has disclosed personally identifiable information to Localphone, please contact us at so that the information can be removed.

## Localphone Spam Policy

Use of Localphone facilities for spamming purposes is strictly prohibited. Misuse of Localphone facilities will be dealt with seriously and can result in the loss of Localphone privileges.
