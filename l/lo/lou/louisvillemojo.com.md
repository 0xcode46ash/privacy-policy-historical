## Mojo Privacy Policy

**1\. Privacy Standards**

Metromojo respects your privacy. We will not give any personally identifiable information (PII) about you to others without your express written permission, except as required by law, legal action, or as required by Metromojo to enforce its Terms of Service and to prevent harassment and abuse on the site. If your actions are determined to be illegal or harassing to other site users, or your conduct is determined to be an abuse of the site, or in violation of our Terms of Service, Metromojo may initiate its own legal proceedings, and/or may involve and share PII information with law enforcement. Metromojo upholds industry best practices for the use and handling of personally identifiable information by conforming to the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/) guidelines. 

**2\. Notice and Disclosure**

Metromojo may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information (non-PII) contained in your registration application. We will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your prior written consent, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or as required by Metromojo to enforce its Terms of Service and to prevent harassment and abuse on the site, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. Depending on the level of your user account, Metromojo may collect as little information as your IP address and user agent string, all the way up to the full amount of information that you have made available to Metromojo through use of our software. 

The aggregated user data collected by Metromojo may be used for purposes of media auditing and site traffic verification. IP addresses may be used to troubleshoot and diagnose problems with our servers or software, as well as to ban and identify abusive users. For purposes of media auditing and third-party site traffic verification, Metromojo reports to auditors who utilize [Interactive Advertising Bureau compliant methodology](http://www.iab.net/standards/measurement.asp). 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site(s). These companies may use information (which is not provided by Metromojo) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you (Metromojo does not have access to this information). In the course of serving advertisements from this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. Users may opt-out of third-party information gathering to the extent provided by the [Network Advertisers Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

**3\. Choice**

Due to our stringent privacy standards, Metromojo does not allow users to opt-out of the minimal amount of information collection required for various levels of membership. You may choose to use the basic services of the site without registering. If you no longer wish to have an account, it will be removed automatically after 365 days of inactivity. 

We provide members the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of receiving marketing communications via email using the "[my account](http://www.louisvillemojo.com/UserModify.Cfm)" link at the top of all screens. 

Furthermore, Metromojo does not share or sell our email database to anyone for any purpose whatsoever. 

This site contains hyperlinks to other sites. Metromojo is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other sites. 

**4\. Data Security and Quality**

Metromojo is committed to maintaining the highest standards of data security and data quality. We have sophisticated measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. If you feel that the security of your account has been compromised, please reset your password [here](http://www.louisvillemojo.com/UserModify.Cfm). 

Registered members are responsible for the accuracy of the data that they provide. If you believe that your self-reported data is no longer accurate, please [update your profile](http://www.louisvillemojo.com/people/myaccount.cfm) accordingly. 

Metromojo reserves the right to deny service to any individual who provides false data or refuses to provide the minimum of data required for service. Providing false data may result in the loss of your account and/or legal prosecution.
