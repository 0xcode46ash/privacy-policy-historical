# Lombardi Publishing

Thank you for your interest in our publications and services. We want you to be aware of the information that we gather and what we do with it. 

We do not install spyware or adware to monitor your activity with regards to your use of the internet nor do we install “cookies” (text files which are forwarded to your browser) for our use. It is our belief that your computer (and your hard-drive) is your own property. 

Your information is used for product delivery purposes (e.g. your name, address and/or email address) and for payment processing (e.g. your credit card number). From time to time, we use your delivery information to send you details regarding our other publications and special offers. Those customers that provide us with their email address may enjoy free emails with our commentary, advice and/or offers. These emails offer an opt-out or unsubscribe option. We never share your email address with other marketers. Sometimes we make your name and address available to screened companies that want to let you know about products or services as well. Rest assured, however, that your payment information will never be used for anything more than for payment processing and never for marketing purposes. 

We respect that you may not wish to have your name and address information shared. If so, you can instruct us to keep such information confidential and use it only for processing your order and delivering your subscription or book. Send such requests to us at [customerservice@lombardipublishing.com](mailto:customerservice@lombardipublishing.com?subject=PRIVACY%20REQUEST). Include “PRIVACY REQUEST” in the Subject Line and include all relevant information that would be necessary in having us identify you such as your full name and address, account number and publication title (a phone number would help us in case we had additional questions). Anyone wishing to review their information can contact us in the same way. 

We undertake reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is kept safe from misuse or loss. Our internal I.T. Department reviews our data network (including passwords, encryption and back up procedures) regularly to ensure that it is kept free from harm or unauthorized use. 

This Privacy Policy was reviewed and posted on July 1, 2004 and updated on March 4, 2008. Any further revisions will be updated to this webpage. Please feel free to check back with this webpage regularly.
