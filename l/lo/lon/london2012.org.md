## Introduction

We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. 

This Privacy Policy sets out the measures taken by us, The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited (or ‘LOCOG’),  to protect your privacy when you use our website at [www.london2012.com](http://www.london2012.com/) and other domains, microsites or web pages maintained by or on behalf of us or any other official London 2012 organisations (collectively, the ‘Site’). 

The Site contains a microsite, a linked eTendering service and various web pages maintained by or on behalf of the Olympic Delivery Authority (the ‘ODA’), and references in this Privacy Policy to ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ mean LOCOG and/or the ODA, as the context requires. 

We explain below the way in which we collect and use your information and personal data. By using the Site, you consent to the use (including transfer) of such information as described below. 

## What information do we collect, and how do we collect it? 

When you visit the Site, our web servers automatically collect certain data that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website, such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address and information relating to which pages have been viewed (for example, using cookies as described further below). 

When you use the Site, we collect information voluntarily submitted by you (for example, via the preference centre) such as your email address and any other contact details submitted by you and any [optional services selected by you ](https://secure.london2012.com/preferences/validate.cfm?s=1)(for example, whether you have chosen to receive emails about certain topics of interest to you). If you contact us (either by email or via the contact centre), we may keep a record of that correspondence. 

In the course of using the Site as a registered user, you may choose to upload or post private information on public areas of the Site in the form of content and accompanying information. Any such content or information is not considered information that is subject to this Privacy Policy. This is dealt with by the Site’s [terms](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) and conditions. 

## Information provided to us by children 

We are strongly committed to protecting the online privacy of children. In particular, we will not send email communications directly promoting merchandise to any person under 18. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of the internet. Where a child is providing us with information, it is the responsibility of each parent or guardian to supervise them. 

## **How do we use your private information?**

The ways in which we use your information will vary depending on the kind of information you provide and the purpose for which you have provided it. This section sets out the different ways we may use your information. 

  * We may use anonymous information, like your IP address, to compile statistics, to assess the usage of the Site and to customise the Site's content, layout and services.  This will allow us to improve the Site and the services provided through it.
  *  We may integrate your personal data from our various databases to form a single view to allow us to have an effective and efficient communication with you.

  * The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored in, the United States of America for processing by our email administration company who send out email communications on behalf of LOCOG.

  * We may transfer your private information in the event of a transfer of ownership of the Site or of LOCOG or the ODA.

We shall endeavour to keep your personal data accurate and up-to-date. If you apply to register with us (for example, through the Preference Centre), you consent by doing so to our processing the personal data that you submit for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you, which can be exercised in accordance with the Act.  You can (if you pay a small fee to cover administrative expenses) request a copy of information about you held by us at any time by sending us a [written and signed request ](https://web.archive.org/mm/Document/Publications/StategiesPolicy/01/25/80/15/LOCOGSARform_Neutral.pdf "Download LOCOG subject access request form")to the LOCOG [Data Protection Officer](mailto:mailto:dataprotectionenquiries@london2012.com).  


**eTendering**

For certain tendering services available via the Site, we use an eTendering service as an information processing tool. The processing of information in the course of eTendering is limited to procurement purposes. 

On our behalf, a specialist provider of eTendering systems, BravoSolution UK Limited (‘Bravo’), collects, holds and uses all personal data obtained from and about the users of the eTendering service pursuant to the terms and conditions governing use of the [eTendering service (‘eTendering User Agreement’).](https://etenders.london2012.com/esop_custom/pages/rns/en/London2012_User_Agreement_v6_0.pdf "External link opens in a new window")

By using such an eTendering service, you specifically consent to us processing the information that you provide for such purposes and to Bravo’s collecting, holding and using such personal data in accordance with the provisions of the eTendering User Agreement.

We shall disclose your private information if we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law, regulation, court order or any competent governmental, statutory or public authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of any other official London 2012 organisations, of our licensors or of the public. 

We may also cooperate with a law enforcement agency in any official investigation, and we may disclose your private information to that agency in doing so. 

**Cookies**

The Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small file containing an identity code. Your computer accepts the cookie and stores it. When you next visit the Site, the code is retrieved, allowing an individual visitor or computer to be recognised. 

Cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including providing personalised web pages and recognising your choice of language. Cookies do not cause harm to your computer, but, if you wish to stop your computer accepting cookies, go to the help section of your internet browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Firefox) where you will find information on how to do this. 

**Internet awareness**

Whenever you voluntarily post information about you in public areas of the Site, you should be aware that such information can be accessed by the public and may in turn be used by others to send you unsolicited communications. Please exercise discretion in deciding what information you provide. 

**Other websites**

The Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

If you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of those websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. 

Some sections of the Site have their own privacy policies: for example, the[ Olympic ](http://www.london2012.com/about-this-website/torch-privacy-policy.php)[Torch Relay Nomination Process Privacy Policy](http://www.london2012.com/about-this-website/torch-privacy-policy.php) and the [Games Makers Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/mm/Document/Publications/StategiesPolicy/01/25/18/16/games-maker-privacy-policy_Neutral.pdf "Download the Games Makers Privacy Policy"). Any information submitted for those processes is subject to those terms. 

**Security of your private information**

Once we have received your private information, we shall endeavour to protect it by using physical, managerial and technical procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it. 

We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any private information provided to us in an email or in online form while it is being transmitted to us, as the internet is a potentially non-secure method of information transfer. Any such transmission is at your own risk. 

Subject to our obligations under the Act, we do not accept any responsibility for any loss, disruption or damage to your data or your computer system which may occur while using interactive features of the Site.
