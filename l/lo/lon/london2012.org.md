# London 2012: Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 30 May 2007_

**Introduction  
**We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy.

This Privacy Policy sets out the measures taken by us, The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Limited (or "LOCOG"), to protect your privacy when you use our website at [www.london2012.com](http://www.london2012.com/) and other domains, microsites or web pages maintained by us or any other official London 2012 organisations (collectively, the "Site").

The Site contains a microsite and various web pages maintained by the Olympic Delivery Authority (the "ODA"), and references in this Privacy Policy to "we", "us" or "our" mean LOCOG and/or the ODA, as the context requires.

We explain below the way in which we collect and use your private information and personal data (together "private information"). We refer to private information that identifies you personally as "personally identifiable information" (or "PII" for short).

By using the Site, you consent to the use (including transfer) of such information as described below.

**What information do we collect, and how do we collect it?  
**  
When you visit the Site, our web servers automatically collect certain data that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website, such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address and information relating to which pages have been viewed (e.g. using cookies as described further below).

When you use the Site, we collect information voluntarily submitted by you (e.g. via online or offline registration forms), such as your email address and any other contact details submitted by you and any optional services selected by you (e.g. whether you have chosen to receive future communications from us).

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and, if so, shall treat that as PII.

In the course of using the Site as a registered user, you may choose to upload or post private information on public areas of the Site in the form of content and accompanying information.  Any such content or information is not considered PII that is subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Information provided to us by children  
**We are committed to protecting the online privacy of children under the age of 18.  We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of the internet. Where a child is providing us with PII, it is the responsibility of each parent or guardian to supervise them.

**How do we use your private information?**  
You agree that we may use your private information for the following purposes:

  * We may use it to operate the features of the Site and to allow you, when you choose to do so, to participate in features available only to registered users or interactive features of the Site.
  * We may use it, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes, for the provision by us or by selected third parties of relevant information, products and/or services in which we think you may be interested.
  * When you sign up to take part in a London 2012 programme or initiative (e.g. our London 2012 volunteer programme) or any London 2012 business or cultural network that we may operate from time to time, or to receive online and/or email communications (e.g. our supporters’ or partners’ newsletters or business e-alerts) or text communications (e.g. communications enabled via the Site between us and users of mobile telephones or other portable devices), we may use the information that you provide to maintain appropriate databases and otherwise to operate and facilitate such programmes, networks and communications.
  * We may from time to time operate online job application systems via the Site.  If you submit such an application, we may process the information provided by you for the purpose of considering the application.
  * We may use anonymous information (i.e. other than PII), like your IP address, to compile statistics, to assess the usage of the Site and to customise the Site's content, lay-out and services. This will allow us to improve the Site and the services provided through it.
  * We may provide your private information to any third party that administers any facility, service or promotion operated via the Site on our behalf to enable such third party to administer that facility, service or promotion properly.
  * We may disclose your private information to any member of our group of companies from time to time (i.e. any subsidiary, holding company or subsidiary of such holding company, as such terms are defined in section 736 of the Companies Act 1985 and any company in common ownership with us), as well as to any statutory body that may be established in connection with the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.
  * The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") for processing by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for any other official London 2012 organisations.  If you submit PII, you specifically consent by doing so to such transfer, storing or processing. We shall endeavour to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  * We may transfer your private information in the event of a transfer of ownership of the Site or of LOCOG or the ODA.



Apart from the purposes described above, we shall only use the private information that you provide to us for the purposes described at the point of collection or for purposes that are otherwise legally permitted.  
**  
Data protection compliance  
**We shall collect, store and use ("process") your personal data in a manner that is compatible with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act").  We shall endeavour to keep your personal data accurate and up-to-date. If you apply to register with us, you consent by doing so to our processing the personal data that you submit for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you, which can be exercised in accordance with the Act.  You can (if you pay a small fee to cover administrative expenses) request a copy of information held about you by us at any time by contacting [enquiries@london2012.com](mailto:enquiries@london2012.com).

**eTendering  
**For certain tendering services available via the Site, we use eTendering as an information-processing tool. The processing of information in the course of eTendering is limited to procurement purposes. By using such services, you specifically consent to our processing the information that you provide for such purposes.

**When we are required to disclose information  
**We shall disclose your private information if we reasonably believe that we are required to do so by law, regulation, court order or any competent governmental or public authority or to protect our rights and property or the rights and property of any other official London 2012 organisations, of our licensors or of the public. We may also co-operate with a law-enforcement agency in any official investigation, and we may disclose your private information to that agency in doing so.

**Cookies  
**The Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small file containing an identity code.  Your computer accepts the cookie and stores it. When you next visit the Site, the code is retrieved, allowing an individual visitor or computer to be recognised.

Cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including providing personalised web pages and recognising your choice of language. Cookies do not cause harm to your computer, but, if you wish to stop your computer accepting cookies, go to the help section of your internet browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox), where you will find information on how to do this.

**Internet awareness**  
Whenever you voluntarily post PII in public areas of the Site, you should be aware that such information can be accessed by the public and may in turn be used by others to send you unsolicited communications. Please exercise discretion in deciding what information you provide.

**Other websites  
**The Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

If you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of those websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

**Security of your private information  
**Once we have received your private information, we shall endeavour to protect it by using physical, managerial and technical procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access to it.

We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any private information provided to us in an email or in online form while it is being transmitted to us, as the internet is a potentially non-secure method of information transfer. Any such transmission is at your own risk.  
Subject to our obligations under the Act, we do not accept any responsibility for any loss, disruption or damage to your data or your computer system which may occur while using interactive features of the Site.

As best practice, we also strongly recommend that you regularly run an anti-virus programme on all material downloaded from the internet.

**Updating your information and opting out**  
You may change your email address or name or cancel your registration for services provided via the Site at any time. Either navigate to the relevant section of the Site and click on the option to change your details or unsubscribe, or click on the relevant link in any email (or other electronic communication) sent by us to you.

**Updates to this Privacy Policy**  
If we update or otherwise change this Privacy Policy, we shall post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page when this Privacy Policy was last updated.  Your continued use of the Site indicates your agreement to any such changes.

**How can you contact us?**  
We welcome your views about the Site and our Privacy Policy. If you would like to contact us with any queries or comments, please send an email to [enquiries@london2012.com](mailto:enquiries@london2012.com).
