## A note on competitions..

  
We occasionally run competitions here on London Cyclist so we can give-away nice prizes to our readers. Entry to these competitions is normally only open to UK residents aged 18 and over. However, special conditions may apply and these will be stated in the competition entry page. Anyone related to London Cyclist (as in the owner/employees/freelancers/advertisers) can’t enter the competitions. It’s a condition of entry that are rules are accepted as final and that the competitor agrees to abide by these rules. The decision of the judges is final and no correspondence will be entered into. The winner may be asked to participate in publicity and that is their choice. The winners name will be announced. Events may occur that render the prize draw itself or the awarding of the prize impossible due to reasons beyond the control of the promoter. The promote (London Cylcist) may at its absolute discretion vary or amend the competition and the entrant agrees no liability shall be attached to the promoter as a result therof. If there is any conflict with these rules and the specific competition rules then the latter take preference. Which is all legal jargon for play nice!
