At London Drugs, we will not collect, use, or disclose your personal information without your consent - except as required or permitted by law. We do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone for any reason.

Personal information you provide to us will only be used by us as part of our ongoing efforts to provide you with superior service and selection.

We know that we earn your business and your trust with each transaction. That is why we will take every step necessary to protect your privacy by safeguarding any personal information we collect, provide to third-party service providers and/or store during the course of doing business together.

Our mandate for protecting your privacy is to ensure that our privacy standards meet or exceed the guiding principles established in federal and provincial privacy legislation.

In order to participate in our LD _Extras_ Program (the “Program”), you will need to register and provide certain information, such as: name, address, email, phone number and, at your option, birth date, gender and certain preferences and interests. This information is collected in order to manage your participation in and communicate with you about the Program, as well as to personalize and improve your Program experience.

You will have the option to receive additional Program emails, intended to maximize the benefits and value members will enjoy from the Program. Such emails may contain the LD _Extras_ you earn, program status updates, as well as special promotions, offers, events and news. These are only for Program members and are different from emails or e-newsletters you may otherwise receive from London Drugs.

You can register for the LD _Extras_ Program or unsubscribe at any time at: [www.ldextras.com](http://www.ldextras.com/)

Through the Program, personal information is collected from members in the following ways: (i) information voluntarily provided by members, such as when you register to become a Program member; and (ii) when a member uses his or her member identifier number (usually their phone number) to make a purchase at a London Drugs store or online at [www.londondrugs.com](http://www.londondrugs.com/), certain transaction data is collected and will form part of that member’s profile. Transaction data collected may include: date/time/location/value/product and type of purchase. Such data is used to accrue benefits in the form of LD _Extras_ to members, but also may be used to provide personalized and exclusive offers and benefits for that member.

We may also gather information about the purchasing behavior of members in an aggregated, non-identifiable manner in order to improve the ways in which we operate the Program, to better understand the needs and preferences of members and to provide improved service and value to our customers generally.  
Note that participation in the Program will be initially limited to employees or customers at select London Drugs store locations. But we hope to expand the LD _Extras_ program to all London Drugs stores very soon!
