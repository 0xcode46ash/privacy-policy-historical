# Privacy policy - External System website - University of London

The External System recognises that data protection and privacy are an important issue, particularly with regard to the World Wide Web; consequently we take your personal privacy very seriously. The Privacy Policy gives an overview of what information is collected when you access our website and how certain information might be used. 

We adhere to the principle of data protection and privacy and endeavour to implement it within the guidance of current legislation.

##  Accessing the External System's website

As a general rule, the External System website employs the notion of 'public access' and does not require you to login. Consequently, when you access the website you are not required to submit any personal information; however, in common with most websites, certain anonymous data is gathered. For each visitor, our web server collects usage data, similarly, we use an analytics package to provide additional anonymised statistics; the type of information obtained might include: the number of page visits per week, the average number of pages viewed by users, domain names (e.g. .com, .ac.uk, .net), referring sites (e.g. Google.com, Yahoo.com), Browser summaries (e.g. the number of visitors using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox) and Operating System reports (e.g. the number of page requests made using Windows XP, Windows Vista, [Mac] OS X or Unix). 

On occasion summary statistics may be disclosed to third-parties, however, it is important to understand that the data doesn't provide any personal information (e.g. email addresses) and isn't attributed to individuals. The primary purpose for collecting the information, which is used on an aggregate basis, is to improve the content and functionality of our website.
