## Direct Marketing 

If you book a ticket from us, the data you give us about yourself will enable us to give you updates other than through our web site, using the contact details you provide, on promotions and services we think may interest you or to involve you in market research.

Whenever we ask you for information about yourself, if you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material from us and/or from third parties, your personal details will be included in a database compiled for direct marketing purposes and from time to time, you may receive these marketing communications. This will enable us to keep you informed about offers and events run by various attractions across the Merlin Entertainments Group, including Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Warwick Castle, Madame Tussauds, The Merlin Entertainments London Eye and Chessington World of Adventures. 

If you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material or e-mail updates from us, and/or from third parties but subsequently change your mind, you should notify us at privacy@londoneye.com. As soon after this as is reasonably practicable, we will remove your name from the relevant database. 

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.
