# LondonJobs UK Privacy statement

**LondonJobs Privacy Statement**  
  


Your trust is our most important asset. You should be aware that this policy applies only to LondonJobs.co.uk and Jobsite UK (Worldwide) Limited's websites ("Jobsite") and not to the other websites to which we provide links. At LondonJobs we are very serious about protecting your privacy. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe.

We may use this information to tell you of changes to the Site (and any changes to this policy will be posted here). We may also use the information to communicate with you and to let you know about products and services in which you may be interested, from LondonJobs, Jobsite, other Daily Mail & General Trust companies and from reputable and trustworthy third parties. This will only be done with your consent. With your consent, we may supply personal information to third parties. We may also provide them with overall statistics about customers and visitors to our Site. The latter will not include information that could personally identify you.

We reserve the right to access and to disclose personal information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect either ourselves or our users.

We guarantee this for all Jobsite websites: LondonJobs, Jobsite, CityJobs, Careers in Logistics, Conkers and any other website owned or controlled by us. This may not be the case for other sites we link to.

|  |  **What Information we Need**  
To provide the services you want, we need to know information about you, your skills and job preferences. 

If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and e-mail address. This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won.

If you order Services from us, we will ask you for your Company name and address main contact details, contact details for invoicing and information about who will use the Services. Dependant on your payment terms, we may ask you for your credit card details.

If you use our 'email a friend' service, we ask for the friend's email address. We then send an automatic, one-time email inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this transaction are stored only to send that one-time email or to track complaints of mischievous use. Your friend may email [help@londonjobs.co.uk](mailto:help@londonjobs.co.uk) to ask that it be deleted.

We may use some of the information collected about you to personalise your visits to our Site so that the Site appeals to your interests and offers goods or services to you that you may want. We can also use the information to help us develop the design and style of our websites to improve our service to you.

Occasionally, we will use your personal information to inform you about the latest changes to our Site, and products or Services that you might find interesting.

We will send you our newsletter if you have signed up for it. You may unsubscribe at any time using the link provided at the bottom of the newsletter email.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site.

Our Site uses persistent cookies to keep track of your navigation, searches and actions every time you visit the Site. These cookies expire after two years, and do not allow anyone to access your confidential information. If you are using a shared computer, please ensure that you log out of MyLondonJobs or close down the browser before leaving the computer for the next user. For more information on what a cookie is and what it is used for see the section More About Cookies.

**Your CV**  
We regard your CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control over who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your details (name, address, telephone number, email address, employment history etc) visible to recruiters. 

As an operator of a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality that you believe is appropriate.

The level of control is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide" means that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use it when applying for individual jobs.

We use our best efforts to limit access to our CV services to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. If any recruiter is found to be in breach of these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their use of our Services. A link to our [Client terms and conditions](http://www.londonjobs.co.uk/client_terms) may be found at the bottom of this page.

You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these instances.

**Jobs-by-Email**  
The Jobs-by-Email service matches a job seeker's requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our Site. For job seekers who subscribe to this Service you receive an email listing those jobs that we believe you should be interested in. You define your requirements by creating "strings" which can be used to specify geographic region, specific job titles, skills or other definition of the job you want. You can change the strings at any time or unsubscribe at any time. **Filtering Forms**  
When you apply for positions with some of our Clients, you will be requested to complete a Filtering Form. The information submitted by you on the Filtering Form will be used by our Client to assess your suitability for the position to which it applies. We are not responsible for framing the questions in our Client's Filtering Forms, and merely provide the electronic means to enable our Client to present the Filtering Form to you, and to collect the Filtering Form once it has been completed by you. We do not process any of the data in completed forms, which we present to our Clients in our Applicants' database. We may, however, temporarily store your completed forms. **More About Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. This allows you to experience a more personalised service when you revisit our Site and allows us to find out about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. If you choose not to receive our cookies, you may not be able to access or use all parts of our Site. You can learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.com **Your Consent**  
By using this Site, you agree that we may collect and use information as described in this policy. We will always make clear how we do this, and allow you to tell us whether and to whom your information may be disclosed. 

To comply with British and European Union laws, we have to make clear that your details may be supplied to third parties, possibly outside the European Economic Area.

Information may also be sent outside the European Economic Area for processing, either by ourselves or by other companies. By using this Site you consent to both of the above types of transfer.

**Opting out of LondonJobs' Services**  
We allow users to opt-out of having Jobs-by-Email alerts sent to them at any time, and allows users to hide their CVs both at the time that the CV is placed on the Site, and at any time afterwards. 

This Site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our Services:
