We collect information other than Personal Information (“Non-Personal Information”) about your use of our Website.  


A. Cookies  


We use “cookies” to customize your experience on the Website.  “Cookies” are small computer files that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive that contain information such as your user ID, user preferences, the pages you’ve visited and the activities you’ve performed while using the Website. We do not link the information stored in cookies to any of your Personal Information you submit while on the Website.  You may block cookies or delete cookies from your hard drive; however, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to all of the features of the Website.  Some of our business partners also use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding your use of the Website. We do not have access or control over these cookies and our privacy policy does not cover the use of third party cookies.  


B. Web Beacons  


We or our third party tracking utility company also use “web beacons” to collect anonymous information about your use of our Website and the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters we send to you. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user’s browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Website and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites and opening our emails, and for what purposes. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our Website. We do not link Non-Personal Information from web beacons to Personal Information without your permission.

B. Market Research  


From time to time the Lonny market research department, or its operations contractors acting on its behalf, may conduct online research in order to gather feedback about our site and our sponsors through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit Personal Information. This Personal Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor. Personal Information collected through market research will be used only by Lonny and its service providers and contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. We will not knowingly accept survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the age of 18. In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey.
