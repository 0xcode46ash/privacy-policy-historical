When contacting consumers for informational, marketing and for commercial purposes, Long Island Firearms, like many organizations, may utilize third party service providers for some routine services such as promotional mailings. In such cases, Long Island Firearms provides only the information necessary to ensure the service is delivered and requires that the service provider sign a non-disclosure agreement agreeing to keep the customer’s information confidential and secure and limiting its use to the purpose for which it was disclosed. After the service provider has completed the service, the service provider must either destroy the information or return it to Long Island Firearms.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless you expressly authorize such disclosure or we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury, or a perceived physical threat to any individual (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability) or is required by law, or to comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants, or in response to a request from local, state or federal law enforcement officials) as required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

If we merge with another business entity or substantially all of its assets related to the products or services that you receive from us are acquired by another business entity, it is likely that customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the other business entity. In the event of such a merger or acquisition, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to the other business entity pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personally identifiable information submitted to the site by children under 13 years of age.
