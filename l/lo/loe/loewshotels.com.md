    We may share non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (for example, the % of male and female visitors to our sites) with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in an effort to customize or enhance the content and advertising on our sites for our users.
    We do reserve the right, in connection with the potential sale or transfer of the interests of Loews Hotels, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliates, to sell or transfer your information (including but not limited to your address, name, age, gender, zip code, state, and country of residency and other information that you provide through other communications) to a third party entity that (1) concentrates its business in a similar practice or service, (2) agrees to be Loews Hotels, Inc. successor in interest with regard to the maintenance and protection of the information collected, and (3) agrees to the obligations of this privacy policy.
