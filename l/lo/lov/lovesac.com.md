LoveSac cannot be responsible, however, for any damages caused by the failure of unaffiliated third parties to honor their privacy obligations to LoveSac.

LoveSac takes seriously its obligation under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act concerning the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. The Site is not directed to children, and LoveSac does not knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. LoveSac encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of the Internet.
