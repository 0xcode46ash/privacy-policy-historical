# LOVEFiLM | Europe's No.1 online DVD rental service

**Summary**

We respect your privacy. This policy sets out what personal information we gather about you when you visit our website, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it.

**What we collect**

General information: LOVEFiLM is owned and operated by Online Rentals Limited. When you visit the LOVEFiLM website, we automatically retrieve general information related to your use of the site, including the DVDs you view and rent, your ratings and reviews of DVDs, areas of the site you may visit, your IP address, and the domain name and browser that you are accessing the internet from. None of this information personally identifies you to us or to any other party.

Personal information: if you wish to join LOVEFiLM and use our service, you need to provide us with personal information, including your name, email address, physical address, and credit card details.

How we use the information

The information you supply to us is used in the following ways:

We use personal information to:

  * Provide you with the core DVD rental service including sending you DVDs, communicating with you regarding your account and other areas related to our service.
  * Tell you about changes to our service.
  * Suggest DVDs that you may like to rent.
  * We may also include within our communications (for instance, within an email we would normally send you as part of our service, or as an insert in the envelope used for posting discs), information from companies that provide products or services that you may find useful. If you indicate, by marking the "opt-in" box when you provide us with your financial details, you confirm your preference to receive promotional information from such companies. Even if you "opt-in", we will not sell or disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent.



Your personal information is used by us only. We will not sell or disclose your personal information to any third party without your permission, except where we are required or permitted by law to do so. You agree that we may disclose your personal information to relevant authorities, parties and or applicable intellectual property rights holders (or their representatives) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have breached our Terms and Conditions, or to anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and obligations under this agreement.

We use general information collected to:

  * Send you your DVD selections
  * Recommend additional DVDs that you might want to rent
  * Improve the usability of our site



We may provide aggregate statistical information (e.g. number of customers in each post code, most popular DVD titles rented, etc) to suppliers or other partners in order to improve our service and business. Such information will never include data that may identify you personally.

**Storage and Security**

LOVEFiLM uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us. This keeps your card and personal details private.

We make every effort to ensure that your personal information is stored securely. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, any information that you send to us over the internet is sent at your own risk. Similarly, you are responsible for keeping your login password private and secure. You should contact us immediately if you believe there has been any unauthorised use of your account or your login password has become known to someone else.

We let you store your card details with us, so that you can continue your subscription without needing to re-type your details in. We only ever show you the last four digits of your card number on our public Internet site and of course, this information is 'for your eyes only'.

Your payment details are held in a secure server in the UK that is not accessible from the Internet.

We will retain your personal information for a period after the cancellation of your membership with LOVEFiLM. This is required for accounting and taxation purposes. We will hold your information only for as long as we are required to retain that information.

**Payment Information**

Your credit /debit card details are encrypted on a secure server and are used by us to process the payment for your regular monthly subscription.

**Access to Data**

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our database. If you wish to use that right, you should write to us at:

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small file that we place on your machine to allow us to remember you and your details.

Cookies make the website easier to use, and it is only your browser that we recognise and not you personally. In order to protect your privacy, we suggest you log out when you have finished browsing the site - this is particularly important when you are using a shared computer in a public location (e.g. a library, web cafe or other location).

If you wish, you can adjust your browser so that your computer does not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to view the homepage. You will not be able to use registration with LOVEFiLM or use certain facilities like 'remember me' where cookies are used. To find out how to enable/disable cookies, please click [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies).

**Email marketing and opting out of emails**

By becoming a subscriber of LOVEFiLM and providing us with your email address you consent to receive emails from us regarding your account. We also send out regular newsletters, offers and updates. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails from us we recommend that you visit [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/account.php) > General Preferences, where you can tailor the information you receive from us or opt out of receiving any information.

**Your ability to edit and cancel your account**

You can access your account from My Account to update and correct the personal details that we gathered when you subscribed. You must be logged in to access this information. All information is password-protected so no one can access the information but you. You may also cancel your membership from this area.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may modify or update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes to the privacy policy will be posted here.

**Your comments, questions, concerns**

Please send any questions or comments about this privacy policy to Customer Services at [privacy@lovefilm.com](mailto:privacy@lovefilm.com)
