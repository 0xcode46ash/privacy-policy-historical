# LOVEFiLM - Online DVD Rental UK

Summary

We pride ourselves in being respectful of your privacy and treat your data with the same level of care and security that we would ourselves expect as customers of other businesses. We consider it central to how we conduct our business and treat our customers. 

We hate spam e-mail as much as you do, and will never pass on your contact information to third parties without your consent. The only exception to this policy applies when we need to furnish others with essential information to provide the LOVEFiLM service (e.g. for postal delivery, account payment, etc). 

The Details

LOVEFiLM complies with current Data Protection legislation. 

LOVEFiLM (formerly known as DVDsOnTap.com) is owned and operated by Online Rentals Limited.

The information you supply to us is used in the following ways:

Subscription Service

Personal information such as your name and address, which you provide during the registration process, is used to: 

  * Provide you with the core DVD rental service including sending you DVDs, communicating with you regarding your account and other areas related to our service
  * Tell you about changes to our service
  * Suggest DVDs that you may like to rent
  * We may also include within our communications (for instance, within an email we would normally send you as part of our service, or as an insert in the envelope used for posting DVDs), information from companies that provide products or services that you may find useful

When you visit the site, we may collect information related to your use of the site such as the DVDs you view and rent, your ratings and reviews of DVDs, and areas of the site you may visit. We use this information to: 
  * Send you your DVD selections
  * Recommend additional DVDs that you might want to rent
  * Improve the usability of our site



Payment Information

Your credit /debit card details are encrypted on a secure server and are used by us to process the payment for your regular monthly subscription. 

Use by Third Parties

Your details are used by us only and are not disclosed to any third party, except where we are required by law to do so, or where such disclosure is necessary to provide you with our service (e.g. for postal delivery, account payment, or to a supplier of technology). Other than for the reasons described above, we will never pass on your personal information to a third party without your consent. 

Aggregate Information 

We may provide aggregate statistical information (e.g. number of customers in each post code, most popular DVD titles rented, etc) to suppliers or other partners in order to improve our service and business. Such information does not include data that may identify you. 

Security 

LOVEFiLM uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us. This keeps your card and personal details private.

We let you store your card details with us, so that you can continue your subscription without needing to type your details in. We only ever show you the last four digits of your card number on our public Internet site and of course, this information is 'for your eyes only'.

Your payment details are held in a secure server which is not accessible from the Internet.

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Acts 1984 and 1988. You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our database. If you wish to use that right, you should write to us at:

Cookies

A cookie is a small file that we place on your machine to allow us to remember you and your details.

Cookies make the website easier to use, and it is only your browser that we recognise and not you personally. In order to protect your privacy, we suggest you log out when you have finished browsing the site - this is particularly important when you are using a shared computer in a public location (e.g. a library, web cafe or other location).

If you wish, you can adjust your browser so that your computer does not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to view the homepage. You will not be able to use registration with LOVEFiLM or use certain facilities like 'remember me' where cookies are used.

Email marketing and opting out of emails

By becoming a subscriber of LOVEFiLM and providing us with your email address you consent to receive emails from us regarding your account. We also send out regular newsletters, offers and updates. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails from us we recommend that you visit [Your Account > General Preferences](https://web.archive.org/accountemailprefs.php), where you can tailor the information you receive from us.

Your ability to edit and cancel your account
