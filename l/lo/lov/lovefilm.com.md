# LOVEFiLM Privacy Policy

**Summary**

We respect your privacy. This policy sets out what personal information we gather about you when you visit our website, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it.

**What we collect**

General information: LOVEFiLM is owned and operated by LOVEFiLM International Ltd. When you visit the LOVEFiLM website, we automatically retrieve general information related to your use of the site where relevant, including the DVDs you view and rent, your ratings and reviews of DVDs, areas of the site you have visited, your IP address and the domain name and browser that you are accessing the internet from. None of this information personally identifies you to us or to any other third party. 

Personal information: 

If you register as a [LOVEFiLM Member](https://web.archive.org/tsandcs.php "\[Opens in new window\]"), you must provide us with certain personal information, including your name, date of birth, email address and physical address. If you register for and use [LOVEFiLM Services](https://web.archive.org/tsandcs.php "\[Opens in new window\]"), you will also need to provide us with your relevant credit or debit card and payment details. 

**How we use the information**

The information you supply to us is used in the following ways:

If you register as a [LOVEFiLM Member](https://web.archive.org/tsandcs.php "\[Opens in new window\]"), we will use your personal information:

  * held within the Your Account section of the website for the purposes of maintaining your account and continued access to the LOVEFiLM website; 
  * to promote and market LOVEFiLM Services to you, unless you opt-out of receiving such marketing information; and
  * to promote and market third party services which may be of interest to you, if you elect to opt-in to receive such marketing. 



If you elect to use [LOVEFiLM Services](https://web.archive.org/tsandcs.php "\[Opens in new window\]"), in addition to the above uses we we will use your personal information to:

  * keep records of your use of LOVEFiLM Services, for business recording purposes and to tailor services and related communications to meet your requirements; and
  * tell you about changes to LOVEFiLM Services.



Your personal information is used by us only. We will not sell or disclose your personal information to any third party without your permission, except where we are required or permitted by law to do so. You agree that we may disclose your personal information to relevant authorities, parties and/or applicable intellectual property rights holders (or their representatives) if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have breached our Terms and Conditions or to anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and obligations. 

We use general information collected to: 

  * Send you your DVD selections;
  * Recommend additional DVDs that you might want to rent; and
  * Improve the usability of our site.



We may provide aggregate statistical information (e.g. number of customers in each post code, most popular DVD titles rented, etc) to suppliers or other partners in order to improve our service and business. Such information will never include data that may identify you personally. 

**Storage and Security**

LOVEFiLM uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us. This is designed to try and keep your personal information (including your credit and debit cards) private.

We make every effort to ensure that your personal information is stored securely. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, any information that you send to us over the internet is sent at your own risk. Similarly, you are responsible for keeping your login password private and secure. You should contact us immediately if you believe there has been any unauthorised use of your account or if your login and password details have become known to someone else. 

We let you store your card details with us, so that you can continue your subscription and use of LOVEFiLM Services without needing to re-enter your details on each occasion. We only ever show the last four digits of your card number on our public Internet site and of course, this information is intended 'for your eyes only'.

Your payment details are held in a secure server in the UK that is not accessible from the Internet. 

We will retain your personal information for a period of time after the cancellation of your membership with LOVEFiLM. This is required for general business recording, accounting and taxation purposes. We will hold your information only for as long as we are required to retain that information. 

If you subscribe to LOVEFiLM Services we will continue to provide you with services available to a LOVEFiLM Member unless you inform us otherwise, including by opting out of any related marketing.

**Payment Information**

Your credit and/or debit card details are encrypted on a secure server and are used by us to process the payment for your regular monthly subscription. 

**Access to Data**

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998, including the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our database. If you wish to exercise that right, you should write to us at:

A cookie is a small file that we place on your machine to allow us to remember you and your details. Cookies make the LOVEFiLM website easier to use. Each cookie we use recognises only the browser that you access the LOVEFiLM website from and not the individual in person. . 

In order to protect your privacy, we suggest you log out on each occasion when you have finished browsing the LOVEFiLM website - this is particularly important when you are using a shared computer in a public location (e.g. a library, Internet cafe or other location).

If you wish, you can adjust your browser so that your computer does not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to view the LOVEFiLM homepage. You will not be able to use LOVEFiLM Services or certain facilities (such as the 'remember me' function) where cookies are used in order to provide such services or facilities.
