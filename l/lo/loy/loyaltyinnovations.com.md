**SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**

Travel and Transport, Inc. (“T&T”) respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, employees, business partners and others. Not only does T&T strive to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles T&T follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the twenty-seven member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to the United States. 

**SAFE HARBOR**

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States (the "U.S.-EU Safe Harbor"). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy T&T adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. 

**SCOPE**

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to all personal information received by T&T in the United States from the EEA, in any format, including electronic, paper or verbal. 

**DEFINITIONS**

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply: 

“Agent” means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, T&T or to which T&T discloses personal information for use on T&T’s behalf. 

“T&T” means Travel and Transport, Inc., its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups in the United States. 

“Personal information” means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of T&T to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. 

“Sensitive personal information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, views or activities, that concerns health or sex life, information about social security benefits, or information on criminal or administrative proceedings and sanctions other than in the context of pending proceedings. In addition, T&T will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive. 

**PRIVACY PRINCIPLES**

The privacy principles in this Policy have been developed based on the Safe Harbor Principles. 

**NOTICE:**  Where T&T collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them, the types of non–agent third parties to which T&T discloses that information, the choices and means, if any, T&T offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of personal information about them, and how to contact T&T. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to T&T, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before T&T uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. 

Where T&T receives personal information from its subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EEA, it will use and disclose such information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates. 

**CHOICE:**  T&T will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

For sensitive personal information, T&T will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

T&T will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices. 

**DATA INTEGRITY:**  T&T will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. T&T will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. 

**TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:**  T&T will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g., companies located in Canada). Where T&T has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, T&T will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. 

**ACCESS AND CORRECTION:**  Upon request, T&T will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, T&T will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. 

**SECURITY:**  T&T will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

**ENFORCEMENT:**  T&T will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that T&T determines is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION:**  T&T participates in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in safe harbor, we have agreed to the [TRUSTe Dispute Resolution Requirements](http://www.truste.com/why_TRUSTe_privacy_services/online-privacy-watchdog.html) for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework.

The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. 

**LIMITATION ON APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES**

Adherence by T&T to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required to respond to a legal or ethical obligation; (b) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations; and (c) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation. 

**INTERNET PRIVACY**

T&T sees the Internet and the use of other technology as valuable tools to communicate and interact with consumers, employees, business partners, and others. T&T recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of information collected online and has created a specific Internet Privacy Policy governing the treatment of personal information collected through web sites that it operates. With respect to personal information that is transferred from the European Economic Area to the U.S., the Internet Privacy Policy is subordinate to this Policy. However, the Internet Privacy Policy also reflects additional legal requirements and evolving standards with respect to Internet privacy.
