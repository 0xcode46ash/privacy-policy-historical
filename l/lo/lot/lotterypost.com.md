# Lottery Post - Privacy Statement

The Lottery Post privacy policies are simple:

  * We do not collect personal information beyond your name and, at your option, your e-mail address.  These two pieces of information are displayed along with your message on our message board.  

  * We do not provide any third party company or individual with any of the information that is posted on Lottery Post.  

  * When you browse the message board, no personal information at all is collected about you.  

  * When you post a message, we put a "cookie" on your PC for your convenience.  The cookie's only function is to retain the name and e-mail address you entered so you don't have to retype it the next time you post a message.  The cookie takes up practically no space on your PC hard drive, and is completely harmless.
