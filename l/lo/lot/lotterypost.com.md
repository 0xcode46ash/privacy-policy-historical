|  Lottery Post Privacy Statement   
---  
  
The Lottery Post privacy policy is simple:   


  * When browsing Lottery Post forums and messages, no personally identifying information is collected or used.
  * When you register as a Lottery Post Member, we will collect minimal personal information, including e-mail address and country. Much of what we ask for is optional.
  * We do not provide any third party company or individual with any of the information that is posted on Lottery Post, or that is provided when you register.
  * When you post a message or when you register to become a member, we put a "cookie" on your PC for your convenience. The cookie's main function is to retain your login information on your PC so you don't have to retype it the next time you post a message. The cookie takes up practically no space on your PC hard drive, and is completely harmless.

  
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20040622191859id_/http%3A//www.lotterypost.com/contact.asp).
