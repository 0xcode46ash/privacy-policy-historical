# Lottery Post - Privacy Statement

The Lottery Post privacy policies are simple:

  * When you post a message as a Guest, we do not collect personal information beyond your name and, at your option, your e-mail address.  These two pieces of information are displayed along with your message on our message board.
  * If you register as a Lottery Post Member, we will collect minimal personal information, including your name, e-mail address, gender, and country & zip code.
  * We do not provide any third party company or individual with any of the information that is posted on Lottery Post, or that is provided when you register.  It is only used by us to understand the basic demographics of those who use our web site.
  * When you browse the message board, no personal information at all is collected about you.
  * When you post a message or when you register to become a member, we put a "cookie" on your PC for your convenience.  The cookie's only function is to retain the name and e-mail address you entered so you don't have to retype it the next time you post a message.  The cookie takes up practically no space on your PC hard drive, and is completely harmless.
