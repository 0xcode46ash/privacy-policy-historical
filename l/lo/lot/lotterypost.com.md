# Privacy Statement | Lottery Post

The Lottery Post privacy policy is simple:

  * When browsing Lottery Post forums and messages, no personally identifying information is collected or used.
  * When you register as a Lottery Post Member, we will collect minimal personal information, including e-mail address and country.  Much of what we ask for is optional.
  * We do not provide any third party company or individual with any of the information that is posted at Lottery Post, or that is provided when you register.
  * When you post a message or when you register to become a member, we put a "cookie" on your PC for your convenience.  The cookie's main function is to retain your login information on your PC so you don't have to retype it the next time you post a message.  The cookie takes up practically no space on your PC hard drive, and is completely harmless.
  * Lottery Post is not a part of, or related in any way to, any government agency or lottery.



If you have any questions about our Privacy Statement, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact "Contact the Lottery Post staff by e-mail.").
