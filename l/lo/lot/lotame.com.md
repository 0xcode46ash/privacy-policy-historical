Last Updated: November 1, 2007

If you would like to opt-out of the Crowd Control browser cookies, please [click here](http://www.crwdcntrl.net/optout). 

Please note: Lotame's privacy practices as described below do not apply to the privacy policies or practices of Lotame clients, affiliates, and publishers using Lotame technology. This privacy policy only applies to www.lotame.com and Lotame Crowd Control. 

Lotame provides online marketing technology to target and retarget relevant audiences. Our goal is to help web publishers and advertisers be more successful by providing a more personalized user experience. We do that by identifying user actions and interests to gain an advanced understanding of the social media user so relevent advertising/messaging can be displayed.

One of the most important aspects of the Lotame technology is the anonymity and confidentiality of the information we collect. 

## Lotame Client Websites 

Personal Information. Lotame does not collect personal information. Personal information means data that identifies you personally, such as your name, telephone number, address, or email address. 

Non-Personal Information. Lotame provides benefits to its clients by collecting anonymous click-stream data whenever you visit a web site that uses Lotame's Crowd Control technology. The information that Lotame collects may include your IP address, the date and time you visited a web site, browser information, and your browsing behavior (that is, the ways in which you interact with the web site). 

Lotame is a Software Licensor and an Application Service Provider. Our software and technology accepts and integrates the Non-personal information made available to us by our clients, collected pursuant to our clients' privacy policy. We assume that our clients comply with their own privacy policy, and Lotame does not own or make use of our clients' data other than to provide information back to the client. Lotame does not share data with anyone other than the client, which owns the data. We may, at times, provide aggregated, anonymous data for measuring purposes and to report industry-wide metrics. 

## Do we share Information with third parties? 

There are other limited circumstances in which we share the information we collect with third parties, for example to help us analyze our products, applications and business. These third parties are contractually bound to use the information only in accordance with this privacy policy. They are not authorized to utilize the information in any way other than to provide their services to us. 

If all or part of Lotame is sold, assigned, transferred or merged, data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is maintained in accordance with this privacy policy. 

Lotame may also release information in special cases in order to comply with any requests from law enforcement and government agencies, and to protect its clients and users. We may do so when we believe in good faith that disclosing information is otherwise necessary or advisable.
