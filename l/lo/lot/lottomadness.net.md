**Jackpot Directory** Privacy Policy

  
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties unless required by law or to protect your membership. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding our Privacy Policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact us. 

**Jackpot Directory** is a prize draw site with members from all over the world. We collect information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, location, age, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: sign up as a member; make changes to their member profile information; and send e-mail messages. If you are joining **Jackpot Directory** through an invite of another member, they will also receive your name and email address so that they can keep you updated and help you as needed. 

Like many other web sites, **Jackpot Directory** uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive - not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use **Jackpot Directory**. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use **Jackpot Directory**. 

**Jackpot Directory** contains links to other web sites. Please be aware that **Jackpot Directory** is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit, including those of our “Business Partners” or “Partners”, as they are responsible for having their own privacy practices, so check their sites for further details. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than **Jackpot Directory** , different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties. 

Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, file uploads, events, and classifieds - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online like in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
