# Privacy Policy | Linux Professional Institute (LPI)

LPI is committed to protecting the privacy of its candidates and community members. We will not collect any personal information that is not volunteered, and LPI is the sole owner of all information collected at this site.

## Cookies

As done at many other web sites, LPI uses cookies to identify users so they don't have to re-enter their user ID and passwords when using our web site. Cookies also help LPI to improve our web site's usability by allowing users to specify preferences such as a choice of language. If you have cookies disabled, you must enter your password each time you access certain areas of the LPI site. Any cookies set by the LPI site are only valid until you log out of the web site or shut down your browser.

## Official LPI Affiliates

[LPI Affiliates](https://web.archive.org/international-affiliates) are official representatives of LPI that provide regional support of LPI activities and values around the globe. LPI may provide candidate contact information to LPI Affiliates who wish to send candidates in their region information about LPI activities as long as they contact them in full compliance with the communication laws of that region.

LPI may also request that candidates provide information to LPI Affiliates to assist in the verification of their certification status. Compliance with such requests is voluntary, and involves providing the minimal information necessary to obtain a candidate's status (LPI ID, name, and year of certification).

## Email

If you do not wish to receive email updates from LPI you may opt-out at any time. All communications sent from LPI Inc. have an unsubscribe link to make this process easy and to be fully compliant with email communications laws.

Email addresses of webinar attendees may be shared with the company or organization providing the webinar to allow them to provide additional information or special offers with the understanding that users have the ability to opt-out of further communication at any time.

## Pearson VUE

Candidates who have registered to take LPI exams through the Pearson VUE network may have provided personal information that has been provided to both LPI and Pearson VUE.

## Affiliated and linked sites

LPI expects its partners and affiliates to respect the privacy of its candidates. Please be aware, however, that third parties, including LPI partners and affiliates and other content providers accessible through its site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. LPI is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. Please check the applicable privacy policies when providing information to a third party.

Anyone voluntarily disclosing Personally Identifiable Information on message boards, mailing lists or in chat areas, must be aware that such information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without LPI's knowledge. This may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties; such activities are beyond the control of LPI and this policy.

## Security

LPI uses reasonable precautions to protect the personal information disclosed by candidates and other community members. LPI is not responsible for the actions or any breach of security by any LPI partners.

## Children

LPI does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If LPI discovers it has received any information in violation of this policy, such information will be deleted immediately.
