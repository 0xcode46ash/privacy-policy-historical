# Privacy Policy | Linux Professional Institute (LPI)

LPI is committed to protecting the privacy of its candidates and community members. We will not collect any personal information that is not volunteered, and LPI is the sole owner of all information collected at this site.

## Cookies

As done at many other web sites, LPI uses cookies to identify users so they don't have to re-enter their user id and passwords when using our web site. Cookies also help LPI to improve our web site's usability by allowing users to specify preferences such as a choice of language. If you have cookies disabled, you must enter your password each time you access certain areas of the LPI site. Any cookies set by the LPI site are only valid until you log out of the web site or shut down your browser.

## Third parties

LPI may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about the usage of its web site. This data is based upon thousands of user visits to LPI's web site each month; behavioral or identifying information about any individual user is not collected, unless that user has given us permission to share that information.

## Official LPI Affiliates

LPI Affiliates are non-profit organizations that have formally partnered with LPI, to provide regional support and promotion of LPI activities and values.

In instances where official affiliates wish to contact candidates on promotional activities LPI may provide them with contact information.

LPI may also request that candidates provide to Affiliates information to assist in the verification of their certification status. Compliance with such requests is voluntary, and involves providing the minimal information necessary to obtain a candidate's status (LPI ID, name, and year of certification).

## Pearson/Vue and Prometric

Candidates who have registered to take LPI exams through the VUE or Prometric network may have provided personal information that has been provided to both LPI and VUE or Prometric.

## Affiliated and linked sites

LPI expects its partners and affiliates to respect the privacy of its candidates. Please be aware, however, that third parties, including LPI partners and affiliates and other content providers accessible through its site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. LPI is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. Please check the applicable privacy policies when providing information to a third party.

Anyone voluntarily disclosing Personally Identifiable Information on message boards, mailing lists or in chat areas, must be aware that such information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without LPI's knowledge. This may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties; such activities are beyond the control of LPI and this policy.

## Security

LPI uses reasonable precautions to protect the personal information disclosed by candidates and other community members. However, with like-minded organizations (i.e. LPI-delivered certification programs, organizations promoting Linux professionalism or open source standards) LPI may release contact information for promotional purposes. However, LPI is not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties.

## Obtaining your consent

By using our web site, users of the LPI web site give LPI permission to collect information about the pages served to them (as anonymous users) for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics. Registration at the LPI website indicates authorization to LPI to use information provided to personalize the information delivered, and to use such demographic information when calculating aggregate user data. LPI may occasionally amend this policy.

## Children

LPI does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If LPI discovers it has received any information in violation of this policy, such information will be deleted immediately.

## Changes to this policy

LPI reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Continued use of LPI's site following the posting of changes to these terms indicates acceptance of those changes. Anyone wishing to change information provided to LPI, provide details of any known violations, or offer any comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, is asked to [contact us](mailto:info@lpi.org).
