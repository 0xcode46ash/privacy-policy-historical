# Lyoness Privacy Policy | Lyoness.com

**Job Portal and Use of Cookies**  
as of: August 28th 2012

  _Lyoness is committed to equal opportunities for all employees and is proud of the diversity within the team! All qualified applicants will participate in the selection procedure regardless of ethnicity, skin colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nationality, disability or age._

  We take the security of your personal data very seriously and aim to ensure a safe use of this job portal. We undertake to adhere to the data protection laws. This privacy policy describes the data we collect from you and explains how we safeguard this data.

  As our websites are continuously developing to improve our services it is possible that this privacy policy must be changed as well. We thus recommend reading this privacy policy from time to time. The date of the current version is stated at the beginning of this document.

  **_Which data is registered_**

  As www.lyoness.com is an international job portal in which all advertised vacancies from all offices and subsidiaries of the Lyoness group are offered, it is possible that you may choose to select the country you would like to work in. After this preselection you will be directed to the national job portal. A detailed list of all offices within the Lyoness group, which are partially located abroad, can be found by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/en-US/Companies/Organization).

  If you apply for one of the vacancies advertised on our website, you will be requested to complete an application form and upload files.

  The personal data that we collect from you and save is title, first name, last name, address  including street, postal code and city, date of birth, mother tongue, nationality, email address, telephone number, highest grade of education completed, desired salary (annual gross salary) and earliest possible start date. Further, you can list any special competencies and skills, such as IT knowledge and languages among others. In addition, you can provide information about your previous education, work experience, etc.

  Furthermore, you can upload files to our server such as your CV, cover letter, photo, school reports and other documents relevant to the job. In addition, you can send us a message by using the provided text field.

  Lyoness is of course aware that not all of the aforementioned personal data can be demanded due to the respective national laws. We have thus set up as few required fields as possible to get the essential information such as surname and contact address. Personal data collected will be used for recruitment purposes only.

  By using the Lyoness job portal you agree to the electronic storing and processing of your entered personal data.  

  **_How long will data be saved_**

  The data entered on your application will be deleted no later than three months after the end of the selection procedure.  
If you would like us to keep hold of your details, please tick the “I would like you to keep hold of my details” box.

  **_Data security_**

Lyoness does not forward any personal data to third parties. However, as part of the electronic processing and management, your data will be forwarded within the Lyoness group. By using this job portal you consent to this.

  To safeguard your data we use encryption software for the data transmission (SSL encryption), firewalls, anti-hacker programmes and other up-to-date safety precautions.

  **_Information and contact_**

We will happily inform you which data we have received from you upon request. Further, you can have this data changed or deleted at all times.
