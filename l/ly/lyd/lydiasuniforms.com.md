** LydiasUniforms.com values its customers and respects their privacy. We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. LydiasUniforms.com recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly.   
**  
** Complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 

we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.  If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has signed up without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable information from our files.

The statements above describe the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it and when we share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please call us at 800.942.3378 or send e-mail to [mail@lydiasuniforms.com](mailto:mail@lydiasuniforms.com).  You may also write to us at:

If our information practices change in the future, we will let you know by posting the policy changes on our Web site or by communicating directly with you. We will notify you of any such change before we use your information in a manner not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information.

**SECURITY STATEMENT**   
Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us.  We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us.  SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it's a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our website's servers.

To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."

If you're not quite comfortable shopping online, or would prefer to make your purchase via telephone, just give us a call at 800.942.3378. Our customer service representatives are standing by 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They'll be happy to take your LydiasUniforms.com order right over the phone.
