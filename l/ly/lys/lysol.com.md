General  
Reckitt Benckiser Inc. (USA) ("Reckitt Benckiser") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our sites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Reckitt Benckiser will collect and how we will use that information. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit Reckitt Benckiser sites or respond to our advertisements. 

We may modify this Privacy Statement and you should therefore periodically visit this page to be sure that you have read and agree with our most current privacy statement. 

Personally Identifiable Information  
Reckitt Benckiser will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. 

When you provide personally identifiable information to us, we may ask if you want to receive future communication from us, such as newsletters, email or other information. You can choose not to receive this communication, if you wish. 

If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please click here to provide us with the email address. 

In addition to providing you with the service or information you request on our site, your personally identifiable information may also be used to help us track the way you use our site and our products. We may also combine the information you provide with information that we collect separately, including information you have provided to other organizations as well as public information. All of this will help us, for instance, better design our products, web sites and advertisements. In order to do this, we may also share your information with companies who carry out work for us. These companies have agreed to only use your information in the way we tell them and to have procedures in place to protect the information. 

If we share your information with an unaffiliated company, other than as set out above, we will contact you first and give you the opportunity to remove your information from our database. 

Children  
Reckitt Benckiser has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under the age of thirteen years. Where appropriate, Reckitt Benckiser will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our sites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should click here to provide us with the email address if they would like this information deleted from our records. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically  
In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the site from which you linked to our site or advertisement. We use this information for the purposes of better understanding our customer's interests and to help improve our business and sites. 

Information We May Place Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive  
When you view one of our sites or advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. For example, this information may be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file that will allow us to tailor a site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Please note that removing or blocking Cookies may interfere with your full use of our site.
