If this sort of thing interests you, we would like your feedback on this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:cm@ly.st) directly with any questions, comments and suggestions.

Lyst knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the www.ly.st website and domain name (collectively, the “Website”), and/or using any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Lyst in connection therewith (collectively the “Service”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

1\. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER? 

This Privacy Policy covers Lyst’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Lyst gathers when you access the Website and/or use some other features of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lyst does not own or control, or to individuals that Lyst does not employ or manage. 

2\. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES LYST COLLECT? 

The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users: 

i. Personal Information You Provide to Us 

We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide the Service, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Service interoperates. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Lyst’s products and services, including special and new features. 

ii. Personal Information Collected Automatically 

a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. Lyst automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 

b. More generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, or user music preference data, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Lyst only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or another feature of the Service so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Service. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Service. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Lyst never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 

iii. E-mail Communications 

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Lyst if your computer supports this type of program. Lyst uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. 

3\. WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Website’s most attractive features.

4\. WILL LYST SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?

Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.

ii. Agents

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.

v. Business Transfers

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Lyst, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Lyst goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Lyst may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

vi. Protection of Lyst and Others

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Lyst, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
