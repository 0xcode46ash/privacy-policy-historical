This Privacy Policy does not apply to other Web sites that may be accessible through the Lumber Liquidators sites. Our sites contain links to other sites operated by third parties, including but not limited to third party sites that display the Lumber Liquidators trademarks. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites to learn how they collect and use information about you.

We collect personal information such as your contact information (name, e-mail address), billing/shipping information (credit card number, shipping address), or your personal preferences (product wish-lists, hobbies, likes and dislikes relating to the products we may sell). When submitting personal information on an online form, we will identify which fields are required in order to fulfill your request.

In addition, when using our Web sites, our servers may collect click-stream information as described above.

#### DO LUMBER LIQUIDATORS WEB SITES USE COOKIES, OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR THIRD PARTIES TO INDIRECTLY COLLECT INFORMATION?

##### Cookies and other Technologies

A cookie is a small data file that a Web site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our Web sites use cookies to simulate a continuous connection —cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our Web sites without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies.

Our Web server automatically collects the address of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.

Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages on our Web sites our visitors view. This non-identifiable click-stream data helps us understand how visitors use our Web site.

##### Third Party Service Providers

Our Web sites may use third party service providers to serve ads, send e-mails and analyze Web site traffic on our behalf. These companies may use technologies similar to those outlined above to measure the effectiveness of ads and e-mails. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites so that we can provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For this purpose, we may also provide these third party service providers anonymous information about your site navigation and purchases.

#### DOES LUMBER LIQUIDATORS SHARE THE INFORMATION I’VE PROVIDED?

Lumber Liquidators may need to share personal information with third parties in limited circumstances. For example, we may release personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf such as; fulfilling our customer’s orders, sending Lumber Liquidators marketing communications from Lumber Liquidators, delivering packages, scheduling and performing installation, servicing products, fulfilling subscription services, conducting research or surveys, sending regular mail and e-mail on behalf of Lumber Liquidators, or processing credit card payments. Lumber Liquidators does not sell or rent customer information to third parties.

The Lumber Liquidators Companies are affiliated entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of Lumber Liquidators Co., Inc. As such, any information you may provide to us either online or offline may be combined or shared between current or future Lumber Liquidators entities and subsidiaries.

From time to time, we may be required to provide personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We may also release personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.

#### DO I HAVE CHOICES REGARDING HOW MY INFORMATION IS USED?

#### HOW DOES LUMBER LIQUIDATORS SECURE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Whether you are shopping online or at a Lumber Liquidators retail store, we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access and alteration of the information under our control.

##### Safe Shopping Policy

Because your credit card security is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure that your payment information is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. The Lumber Liquidators Web site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your credit card information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address, and credit card number. In-store Web stations operate over a private, secure network.

##### Choosing a Personal Password

When you create an online account on the Lumber Liquidators Web site, you need to select a personal password that you will remember. It must be at least 6 characters. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information.

Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Lumber Liquidators cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail and you do so at your own risk.
