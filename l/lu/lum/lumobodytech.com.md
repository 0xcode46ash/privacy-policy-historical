At Lumo Bodytech, Inc. (“Lumo”) we respect your privacy, and are committed to protecting any personally identifying information you may share with us.  Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when providing personally identifying information as a visitor or registered user at [http://www.lumobodytech.com](http://www.lumobodytech.com/), while using our various software services, or while accessing or using other site features such as through email.

By accessing our website, using our software services or sensor devices, or by otherwise providing us with your personally identifying information, you are accepting the practices and policies described in the Privacy Policy.  Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and any changes will be posted on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.

If you have questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Policy, you should first contact us at privacy@lumobodytech.com.

Our Privacy Policy applies to our services, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.  Similarly, our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including third party services used by Lumo.  For these third party services, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable third party privacy policies.

**What Information Does Lumo Collect?**

Information you share with us.  We have access to information that you voluntarily provide us, whether via email, while using our various sensor devices or software services, or other contacts initiated by you, including for example all information you disclose to us when using our products or services.  Information you share with us may include your personally identifiable information such as name, address, or other contact information, as well as various other information pertaining to your use of our products or services such as user data obtained through any Lumo device and stored or accessed through our software or services.  If you choose to register with us and create a user profile you are required to enter your name, contact information including email address, and to create a password.  Additionally, you have the option of providing us with birthday, gender, creating a screen name, or storing your shipping address.

Lumo is the sole owner of the information disclosed to us or collected at [www.lumobodytech.com](http://www.lumobodytech.com/) or through services offered at the website including various mobile platforms integrated with our website such as the Lumo devices and related software services.  We will not use, sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone other than as permitted by the Privacy Policy, or specifically requested or authorized by you when accessing or using our services.

Information we learn from your use of our services.  We use browser session data to store your session data, such as shopping cart contents, while you browse our site.  Your data will be stored only for that browser session.  However, if you have logged in as registered user, then your activities will be saved by browser session and stored on our servers with a session ID.

Like many companies, we monitor the use of the our website, as well as software products and services, by collecting information such as browser type, operating system, IP address, and the like.  No personally identifiable information is collected in this process but this aggregate information may include various data pertaining to you and your use of our services as collected or stored by our products and services.  This information is typically limited to device data, customer demographics and biomechanical data, traffic patterns, sales, service, product and site usage.  This information is used for our commercial purposes, including to improve usability, performance and effectiveness of the website and may be disclosed to third parties as aggregate data without any of your personally identifiable information.

Cookies, Pixel Tags, and other data identifiers.  In some instances, we may collect aggregate data through cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other anonymous identifiers.  We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to or through our partners, such as advertising or commerce services.  We only use this data in aggregate form without access to any personally identifying information.  The majority of web browsers accept cookies and similar files, but you can usually change the browser settings to prevent this.  However, if you do so, some functionality of our site may be impaired or lost, particularly any site customization features.

Our website may provide links to third-party websites that are outside of our control and not covered by our Privacy Policy, e.g. Facebook® and Twitter®.   We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites to learn about those sites policies and practices with respect to your personally identifying information.

Software Apps & Related Devices. **** When using Lumo sensor devices, as well as their related software such as the Lumo App, we collect certain types of information in order to provide the services that you have requested.  This information may include various personally identifiable information such as your name, gender, height, weight, as well as data about your use of our services and devices, such as detailed information collected while monitoring your movements and activity.  This information may include data on your posture and movements, your activity level, calories you consumed, and other related biomechanical information.  We may also collect information about the devices and software you use to access our services.  We will not use, sell or rent any personally identifiable information other than as permitted by the Privacy Policy (including for example by using such data in the aggregate) or specifically requested or authorized by you when accessing or using our software and related services. ****

**How Does Lumo Use This Information?**

We use the information we collect to provide the service or transaction you requested, and importantly, to maintain and improve the services we provide, including for example by providing you with a better user experience when accessing our website.  We only use or process your information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized for use.

We may share your personally identifiable information with authorized third-parties, agents, or our affiliated businesses or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction.  For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We also use information collected from cookies and other anonymous identifiers to improve your user experience and the quality of our services.

We may collect and share personally identifiable information when we have a good faith belief that access, use, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, rule, regulation, or enforceable governmental or administrative request, enforce our applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations, detect, prevent, or address fraud, security or technical issues, or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Lumo Bodytech, Inc., our users or the public.

Our use of information other than for the purpose of completing a requested transaction or service is on an opt-in basis.  This means that you will not receive communications from us regarding, for example, specials, new products or new services, unless you have given us affirmative permission to receive such communications.

**Is My Information Shared With Other Companies?**

Except as stated in our Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personally identifiable information about our users to any third party without your prior consent.

We share personally identifiable information with third parties only to the extent necessary to render services you have requested, for example to trusted business partners who process information on our behalf.  We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We may share non-personal, aggregate information regarding customer demographics, traffic patterns, sales, and site usage with our partners, advertisers or sponsors.  We may offer some services on or in collaboration with other Internet web sites. Personally identifiable information that you provide to those third-party sites may be sent to us so that we can deliver the requested service. We process such information under our Privacy Policy.

We may also provide you with access to third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through our website. Any information collected when you enable a third party application on our site is processed under our Privacy Policy, but any information collected by a third party application provider is governed by their privacy policies.

We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that access to or use of this information, or the preservation or disclosure of this information is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; to enforce our Terms of Service, including for investigation of possible violations; detect, prevent, or otherwise remedy fraud, security threats or breaches, or other technical issues; and to prevent harm to the personal or property rights of Lumo, or other third parties, as permitted by applicable laws.

**How Do I Access Or Change My Personal Information?**

To provide our services, and for you to gain the optimum benefits of our products and services, we need to store and provide you with access to your personal information when accessing or using our services and products. You can review, and update the personal information for your account by contacting us at privacy@lumobodytech.com. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request, and at our discretion, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort or are impractical, or risk the privacy rights of other users. We may not immediately delete copies of your outdated information from our servers and may not remove all outdated information from our backup systems after you delete this information.  This residual retention period is necessitated to protect our information servers from accidental or malicious loss of data.

**What Are Lumo’s Information Security & Compliance Practices?**

We store your personal data on a secure server that is password protected and shielded from outside access by a firewall.  We practice safety procedures intended to ensure, as far as possible, the security and integrity of all our information, including your personally identifying information.   When purchasing a product or service through a Lumo website we offer the use of a secure server and all user supplier credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer technology to a third-party service provider and is then encrypted as a part of their transaction processing.  Whether during or after a transaction your private information will not be stored on Lumo servers. However, no system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard.  As a result, we cannot assure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you provide to us and, accordingly, you do so at your own risk.

We also use a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and to periodically verify that this policy is accurate, comprehensive for the intended purposes, and prominently displayed for consumer review.  We encourage interested persons to share any concerns with us and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding the use or disclosure of your information.  If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal processes, then we agree to dispute resolution through a third party resolution provider such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB), TRUSTe, or Direct Marketing Assoc., that also incorporate the Safe Harbor Framework.

**Information Collected from Residents of the European Union**

Lumo adheres to the U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Agreement and the U.S. – Switzerland Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data to the United States of America.  We follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce with respect to all such data.  If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles shall govern.  Our Safe Harbor certification may be reviewed at the [U.S. Dept. of Commerce Safeharbor website](https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx), and more information about the Safe Harbor Principles may also be found by visiting the [U.S. Dept. of Commerce](http://export.gov/safeharbor/).
