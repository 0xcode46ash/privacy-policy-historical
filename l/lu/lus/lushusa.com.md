## Information Collection, Use, and Disclosure

Information gathered on lushusa.com falls under the following categories:

  * Aggregate Site Use Information
  * Online Order Information and Security
  * E-news Sign-up and Online Customer Forum



## Aggregate Site Use Information

We record information about the pages viewed by all of our website visitors. This data includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, connection speed, read time, display time, and number of clicks.

We use this data, in aggregate form, to compile statistics and reports for LUSH's use, and improve the online experience for all visitors.

We may, on occasion, provide portions of this aggregate information to vendors, consultants, potential advertisers, or news agencies. Typical uses of the data in this fashion would be to gauge the amount of interest in our site and/or to plan for site infrastructure improvements.

### Cookie Use

A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's hard drive. When you visit our site we use cookies. Cookies are required to shop on our site. We also use cookies to assist with anonymous site traffic analysis, which includes tracking the time/date of visits, pages viewed, and referring URLs.

## Online Order Information and Security

If you place an order online, we only request the information needed to complete the processing of your orders and billing. We also share our users' personal information with outside shipping companies and credit card processing companies in order to bill and ship your order, but we do not provide any more information than necessary for these purposes. We may also use the information to contact you regarding your order.

### Our Site Security

We use appropriate security safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Any personal information you provide to LUSH is exchanged on a secure server. We use an advanced security system, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, to encrypt, or encode, information you send to us in the order process. The encryption process protects information, such as your credit card number, and billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent from your computer. Only once we receive your information is it decoded, and we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our own systems.

### Warning:

Email is not a secure means to send personal information, as it is not encrypted. We strongly encourage you to use our secure ordering process when ordering online. For general correspondence we also have our secure Contact Us page.

## E-news Sign-up and Online Customer Forum

Visitors to our site may choose to opt in to receive LUSH email. They may also choose to use our free online customer forum.

### Customer Forum

Visitors choosing to use our free online customer forum are bound by the user-provided content guidelines set out in our Terms of Use.

### E-news Sign-up

LUSH e-news is sent only to users who choose to provide us with their email address. Our subscriber database is never sold, rented or loaned to any other parties. Subscribers wishing to update their contact information, or opt out of receiving e-news, can use our online subscriber services in My Account.

We collect aggregate information regarding open rates, page views, and generated sales from our HTML emails. Aggregate information does not personally identify individuals. Subscribers concerned about collection of aggregate information may unsubscribe in My Account.

## Fraud Prevention

LUSH reserves the right to co-operate with local, national, or international law enforcement or other authorities in the investigation of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of personal information. If such an investigation requires disclosure of personal information kept in our records, we may be required by law to cooperate. We also reserve the right to report improper or unlawful user activities on our site, which may require the disclosure of personal information relating to those individuals conducting such improper or unlawful activities.

## Accuracy of Information

We strive to ensure that any personal information we retain and use is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which we will use it.

Nonetheless, if our records regarding your personal information are inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend that information at your request.

## Access to Information

At your request, we will provide to you a statement explaining the extent to which we hold personal information about you, and we will explain how that information has been used or disclosed by us.
