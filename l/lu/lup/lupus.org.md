# LUPUS FOUNDATION OF AMERICA - Privacy

## Privacy

The Lupus Foundation of America is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors.  Information gathered through the LFA websites is used to monitor our site's effectiveness, fulfill our mission, process your order or donation, provide programs and services, and respond to your questions and requests. Our websites include lupus.org, lupusnow.org, shoplupus.org, lupusvoices.org, walkforlupusnow.org, worldlupusday.org, lupusawarenessmonth.org, LFA-point.org and related subsites. 

##   
Information We Collect and How We Use It 

We collect information about the domain name (.com, .net, .edu, .gov) of a visitor's internet service provider, and the computer and software used to access our websites.  We use this information only for measurement purposes.  These measurements provide total website statistics, such as the number of visitors, how and when visitors arrived at our website, which pages were viewed most often, and the type and version of software used to view pages.  This information helps us effectively manage the website and plan future improvements. 

##   
Email Addresses

We do not automatically collect email addresses or other personal information unless you provide it on a form, survey or email message.  The Lupus Foundation of America does not sell, trade, or rent personal information that you provide to us, except as noted below.

  
When you use the "Email This Article To A Friend" function, available within articles posted on our website, your email address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the article link, or in case of a transmission error.  Your email address and the recipient's email address are not recorded and will not be used for any other purpose. 

  
The email address that you provide to us through an online form (Contact Us, eNewsletter, eAdvocates, 15 Questions, Ask the Experts, Message Boards, Media Spokespersons, Lupus Voices, etc.), or when you make a donation, purchase a product from our online store, or subscribe to our national magazine, _**Lupus Now**_ ®, is used to distribute receipts, acknowledgements, alerts, eNewsletters, announcements, breaking news, or other communications distributed by LFA, or by us at the request of another organization or partner offering products or services we believe may be of interest to you.  You will have the opportunity to unsubscribe from future email messages, or update your mailing lists preferences, by clicking on the appropriate link within the email message you receive.

##   
Online Activity

We do not keep a record of the pages you view while visiting our websites.  However, when you click on a page link contained within an email message, advocacy alert or eNewsletter that you receive from us, that information is stored as part of your online profile.  This information helps us determine which articles or topics are of greatest interest to you so we can better serve you in the future.  The information is not shared with others and is used only to help us deliver information that is more tailored to your individual interests or needs.

##   
Personal Information 

When you order products or services from our online store, subscribe to our magazine, or make a donation, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, and the products or services you request from the LFA.  This data allows us to process, fulfill, and acknowledge your order or donation.  Secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.  Processing your order may require that your information be shared with third party vendors or contractors who provide services on our behalf (such as a firm that would package and ship publications or educational materials you order from us).  However, these third party firms are contractually required to keep this information strictly confidential.    

  
If you provide your mailing address to us, you may receive periodic mailings from the LFA via the U.S. mail.  You also may receive information that we mail on behalf of another organization or partner that we believe may be of interest to you.  If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send your full name and mailing address, along with a request to be removed from our mail list, to [info@lupus.org](mailto:info@lupus.org), or you can write to us at LFA, 2000 L Street, N.W., Suite 410, Washington, DC 20036 - USA. 

##   
Information Exchange 

The LFA periodically exchanges only the names and mailing addresses (not email addresses) of our donors, subscribers, and store customers with other organizations. We do not provide information about the amount you may have donated or its purpose, or the products or publications that you may have purchased from us or one of our cause-related marketing partners.  You may request that we not sell or exchange your name and mailing information by sending an email message to [info@lupus.org](mailto:info@lupus.org), or write to us at the address provided above.  Please include your full name, mailing address and a request that we not exchange your information with other organizations.
