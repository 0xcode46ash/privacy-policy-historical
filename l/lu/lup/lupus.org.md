## Privacy Policy

##  Privacy Policy

We respect the privacy of all visitors to our websites, which include lupus.org and its related sub-domains, the embedded websites of our national network affiliates, lupusnow.org, shoplupus.org, lupusvoices.org, walktoendlupus.org, worldlupusday.org, LFA-POINT.org, and cruelmystery.org.

##  Why We Collect Information

We use data gathered through our websites to distribute information, conduct programs, provide services, process orders and donations, respond to questions, fulfill requests, monitor the effectiveness of our websites, and plan for future improvements.  We do not automatically collect email addresses or other personal information unless you provide it to us on a form, survey or within an email message. 

##  The Type of Information We Collect

####  Cookies

Cookies are small files that our website places onto your computer to manage certain website features and to provide localized information. Cookies do not contain personal information.  Most web browsers give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies.  However, if you block cookies, some website features may be lost or not function properly.

####  Statistical Data

We collect information about the total number of visitors, the date, time, length and frequency of visits, the average length of time and total number of times that visitors view each page, the device and software used to access our websites, how visitors arrived at our websites, and the domain name and locations of visitors' internet service providers.   We also compile lists of the keywords and search terms that visitors used to find information published on our websites, and the websites or search engines that referred visitors to our websites.

####  Personal Information

When you order products or services from our online store, register for an event, program or class, subscribe to our magazine, or make a donation, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, and the products or services you request from us.  This data allows us to process, fulfill, and acknowledge your order or donation. 

Secure server software encrypts all of the information that you provide before transmitting the information to us.  Processing your order may require that we share your information with third party vendors or contractors who provide services on our behalf (such as firms that package and ship the publications or materials you order from us).  However, these third party firms are contractually required to keep this information strictly confidential.  
Online Activity

We do not keep a record of the pages you view while visiting our websites.  However, when you click on a page link contained within an email message, advocacy alert or eNewsletter that you receive from us, that information is stored as part of your online profile.  This information helps us determine which articles or topics are of greatest interest to you so we can better serve you in the future.  The information is not shared with others and is used only to help us deliver future content that is more tailored to your individual interests or needs. 

####  Email addresses

We will ask for your email address when you sign up for our email list, register for an event or program, make a donation, purchase a product from our online store, submit a question, or subscribe to our national magazine.  We use your email address to respond to your inquiry, or to distribute receipts, acknowledgements, alerts, eNewsletters, announcements, breaking news, or other electronic communications.  You may opt out from receiving email communications from us at any time. 

We never share your email address with anyone outside of our organization.  Occasionally, we may distribute email messages to you on behalf of another organization or partner that is offering a program, product, service or information that we believe may be of interest to you.  You may unsubscribe from future email messages by sending your request to info@lupus.org, or by updating your email preferences by clicking on the appropriate link within the email message that you receive.

####  Surface Mail

If you provide your mailing address to us, we periodically may send information to you through the U.S. Postal Service.  You also may receive information we mail on behalf of another organization or partner that we believe may be of interest to you.  You may choose to opt out of receiving some or all surface mailings from us.  Send your full name and complete mailing address (along with any codes that were printed on the mailing label), and the type of information that you no longer wish to receive from us.  Send your request to info@lupus.org or write to us at 2121 K Street NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20037 - USA. 

####  Information Exchange

Periodically, we will exchange only the names and mailing addresses (not email addresses) of our donors, event participants, subscribers, and store customers with other reputable non-profit organizations. We do not provide information about the amount you may have donated or its purpose, or the products or publications that you may have purchased from us, or one of our cause-related marketing partners.  You may request that we not sell or exchange your name and mailing information with other organizations by sending an email message to info@lupus.org, or by writing to us at the address provided above.  Please include your full name and complete mailing address (along with any other information that will help us to locate your record) and a request that we not exchange your information with other organizations.

####  Personal Medical Information

The Lupus Foundation of America maintains the Lupus Research Registry as part of our Center for Clinical Trials Information (lupus.org/clinicaltrials).  The Registry collects demographic data, and lupus, medical, and treatment history.  The personal information we collect when you sign up for the Registry helps us to provide information on lupus clinical trials that may be underway in your area. We will never give, rent, sell or distribute your private, personally identifiable information entered into the Lupus Research Registry to any outside organization. We keep your personal information strictly confidential and fully secure unless you, the user, specifically request otherwise.  

####  Consent

By using this or any Lupus Foundation of America, Inc. website, you consent to the collection and use of the information as described above. We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
