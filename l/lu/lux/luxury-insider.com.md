# Privacy Policy - Luxury-Insider.com

## Our Committment To Your Privacy 

Luxury Insider collects personal information for one reason only: it helps us deliver the content and information that you want. It also allows us to keep you updated of changes to our website, as well as relevant news about products and services you might like to hear about. 

**Your privacy is of paramount concern at Luxury Insider.** We will never sell, rent, or transfer your information in any form to other marketers. 

## Mailing Policy

When you accept to receive information about our website, promotions, newsletters, press releases, and/or new offers, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information or other services, until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email communication.) 

We will never use your email address or other information to provide you with any unsolicited messages or information (unless that is part of the service you are requesting), nor will we share it with or sell, rent or lease it to any third party for such use. 

## When Information Is Collected

Like most websites, our website uses cookies to understand viewer preferences, such as which pages are most popular, how much time is spent on each page, etc. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk. 

For third party accountability, Luxury Insider has engaged the independent web audit company Nielsen//Netratings to measure and analyse the traffic on our website. Nielsen//Netratings is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research. 

The traffic analysis done by Nielsen//Netratings is on a strictly aggregate and anonymous basis. We will never marry any of the aggregate information collected by Nielsen//Netratings to the personal information collected on our website.   


## Strict Non-Disclosure Principle

**We will never sell, rent, or transfer your personal information to third party marketers.**

We may, for technical and/or administrative reasons, provide information to other companies who do work on our behalf. An example of one of these companies would be our hosting providers. We endeavour to pick only reputable third parties to ensure integrity and privacy of your information. 

We will never disclose your personal information to any other third party, save for when compelled by law. 

## Protection Of Information Within Our Company

Only specific authorized employees will have access to all information collected on the website. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy will be subject to our disciplinary process.
