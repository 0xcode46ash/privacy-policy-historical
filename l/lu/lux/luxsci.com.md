# Privacy Policy | LuxSci

Version 2009.08.21

Lux Scientiae, Incorporated has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website and our services in general. Any updates or amendments to this policy will be made here and announced in the news section of LuxSci's members' portal.

## General usage:

While visiting the Lux Scientiae web site, information is stored in a log file for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files are downloaded, and what errors occur. We review which top domain addresses visit our site. This process does not collect any personal information about you or your business.

When you complete any form on our site, your information is written to a secure file or database and/or emailed to our staff.

## Members:

We collect the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of our users in order to identify them and provide billing and support services. Once a user has logged in to Lux Scientiae, cookies are used for authentication and verification purposes. Our cookies reside in a small file stored on your computer, which expires when you close your web browser (or sooner, depending on your personal preferences). Our cookies do not track your movement throughout the Internet and do not, ever, send us information about you when you are not on our site. 

Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what frequency.

## Payments:

All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way, not on Lux Scientiae's servers.

## Non-disclosure:

Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required for compliance with local, state, and federal law. 

The Lux Scientiae Acceptable Use Policies specifically prohibit the use of our service for illegal activities. Therefore, you agree that Lux Scientiae may disclose any and all of your information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, etc. to any law enforcement agent who makes a written request without further consent or notification to you. In addition, Lux Scientiae shall have the right to suspend or terminate all services, at its sole discretion, during such a legal investigation.

Lux Scientiae does not give out its client's email addresses or send SPAM. Lux Scientiae may occasionally send important announcements regarding Lux Scientiae services to its clients if they have not opted out of this notification service.

## Confidentiality:

Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the content of your incoming or outgoing email messages or your WebAides without your explicit consent.

**Exception 1** to this policy is the case where Lux Scientiae management deems a client to be in possible violation of its [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/extranet/legal.html) and considers that analysis of email messages or WebAides to be necessary in order to establish this fact or to stop the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs. The contents of your email messages and WebAides will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.

**Exception 2** to this policy is to audit [High Volume Outbound Email](https://web.archive.org/extranet/high-volume-smtp-email.html) customers' bulk email practices. As stated in the [High Volume AUP](https://web.archive.org/extranet/legal.html) (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP). The contents of your email messages and WebAides will be kept in the strictest confidence that can be afforded by compliance with local, state, and federal laws.

## Medical privacy:

For clients that have to abide by the regulations of HIPAA, LuxSci has the following addendum to its Master Services Agreement (MSA) that is automatically included in the MSA by reference when the client agrees to the terms of the MSA as part of the account signup process. This is the "Business Associate Agreement" between LuxSci, the "Business Associate", and the Client, the "Covered Entity".
