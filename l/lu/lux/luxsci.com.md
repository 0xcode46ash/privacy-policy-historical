## 

General usage: 

While visiting the Lux Scientiae web site, information is stored in a log file for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files are downloaded, and what errors occur. We review which top domain addresses visit our site. This process does not collect any personal information about you or your business.

When you complete any form on our site, your information is written to a secure file or database and/or emailed to our staff.

## 

Members: 

We collect the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of our users in order to identify them and provide billing and support services. Once a user has logged in to Lux Scientiae, cookies are used for authentication and verification purposes. Our cookies reside in a small file stored on your computer, which expires when you close your web browser (or sooner, depending you your personal preferences). Our cookies do not track your movement throughout the Internet and do not, ever, send us information about you when you are not on our site. 

Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what frequency.

## 

Payments: 

All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record of your credit card number on our servers unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is encrypted and stored in our secure database (so even if the database were to be stolen, the credit card information would still be secure). 

## 

Non-disclosure: 

Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required for compliance with local, state, and federal law. Lux Scientiae does not give out its client's email addresses or send SPAM. Lux Scientiae may occasionally send important announcements regarding Lux Scientiae services to its clients if they have not opted out of this notification service.

## 

Confidentiality: 

Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the content of your incoming or outgoing email messages or your WebAides without your explicit consent. The exception to this rule is the case where Lux Scientiae management deems a client to be in possible violation of its [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/extranet/aup.html) and deems that analysis of email messages or WebAides is necessary in order to establish this fact or to stop the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUP. In any case, the contents of your email messages and WebAides will be kept in the strictest confidentiality that can be afforded by compliance with local, state, and federal law.

"IMAP is the best kept secret in Email. It is the quickest and most efficient way to manage your Email; you decide what messages will be retrieved to your machine, whereas with POP you will be forced to wait through lengthy mail downloads to get to the messages you know are important. The IMAP methodology is helpful for power users who might desire multiple mailboxes (for example, some messages they might want kept on their home machine, whereas others belong on their work machine). LuxSci goes the extra mile in delivering a secure line of communication with their servers. If people knew that their interaction with most other mail service providers was exposing their mailbox password to anybody who happens to be eavesdropping on their network connection, I suspect many would be thinking twice about using anything but IMAP and SSL. And LuxSci is presently one of a very few mail hosting companies who offer just that plus the option of a functionally robust browser interface."
