Any such changes will be posted on this page. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use Lunchwalla.com.

**_The Information We Collect_**

We **** collect the personally identifiable information that you submit on the registration and user profile forms to permit you access to our site where applicable. Please note that any optional information you fill out might be visible to other users on the site. If you do not feel comfortable with others knowing this information, then leave it blank.

Generally, the information Lunchwalla.com collects helps us to communicate with you. For instance, we use your email address to provide you with an email confirmation of your registration and to notify you of information concerning your account on our site. In addition, users on the site will be able to communicate with you via comments on the site, but they will not know your e-mail address or other personal identification information aside from your profile details (and therefore will not be able to add you to spam lists, etc). 

We will not share, rent or sell your personally-identifiable information with any entity, subject to the provisions below. We may share your information with our vendors in connection with system maintenance and other services that these individuals or entities perform for us. In some cases, we may run a joint marketing effort with third parties.

This information is required in the registration process but we recognize that this is your personal information and, except as we explain below, we do not give it out to third parties without your approval. In order to vote or plan a lunch or event, we require that you provide a valid mailing address.

**_Discussion Boards_**. In order to participate on our discussion boards, you will need to register on Lunchwalla.com. If you use our discussion boards, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

**_Cookies._** The Lunchwalla.com site employs cookies (small pieces of text stored on your computer) to recognize you and your access privileges. For example, we use cookies to allow you to log on to Lunchwalla automatically without entering your ID and password each visit. Cookies also identify you and your preferences on our site. For these purposes, these cookies are tied to your personally identifiable information. You may refuse to accept our cookies, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user or subscriber, which will limit your access to the site.

**_Location Selector._** If you choose to enter a street address when selecting a location, this information will be saved for your convenience in your Locations list or in your Saved Locations list should you so indicate. This information may make it easier for you to browse and search our content and will not be used for any other purpose.

**_Tell a Friend._** If you choose to email a list, review or link to a friend from the Lunchwalla site, we collect the friend's name and e-mail address. This information is used only to deliver a one-time message to your friend and is not stored on our servers. If "a friend" decides that he/she will register with Lunchwalla, he or she will be given the same rights of access as registered users of Lunchwalla.com. The prospect information that you submit for "a friend" will be used only for the use for which it is submitted. Additionally, for "a friend" to register, he or she will have to follow the Lunchwalla.com registration process (see above) and will be given the same option in regard to receiving marketing materials that Lunchwalla.com offers to all registered users.
