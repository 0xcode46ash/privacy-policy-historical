If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and credit card billing address(es) so that we can process and fulfil your order. Card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment gateway system. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. We will ask for your telephone number to be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

Lulu Guinness may use your personal information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalised shopping experience.

Your personal information may also be shared with other trading divisions within the Lulu Guinness group. Where there is a legal obligation to do so, we may disclose your information to any relevant regulatory body.  
We may also use your personal information to send you marketing updates but only ever in accordance with your preferences (as detailed in the next section). We never sell your details to third party marketing companies.  
We do collate statistical information about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we may pass on to trusted third parties but these statistics do not include any information which can identify you personally. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services.  
Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs.  
From time to time Lulu Guinness may employ third party business partners to collect personal information on Lulu Guinness's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by Lulu Guinness to comply fully with the Lulu Guinness Privacy Policy.
