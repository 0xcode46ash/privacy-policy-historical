# privacy

  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not share, rent or sell your personal information without your consent.   
We collect information when an order is placed on our site. We hold personal information such as name, address and phone number to allow us to fulfill your order and manage your account  
We use the information you provide during the checkout process to process your orders and email your order confirmation. We do not hold credit card details. These are passede directly onto our payment partners system and are not recorded on our system. Unless you ask us not to, we may also use your e-mail address to tell you about changes in our services or offers we think you will find valuable. You always have the option to "opt-out" of our email program at anytime. If at any time you no longer wish to receive information, emails or notices from Lulu Guinness, simply email us at [technical@luluguinness.com](mailto:technical@luluguinness.com)

We do not store any of your personal information on our Site, unless you choose to participate in the "Your Account" section of our Site. By setting up "Your Account," you can create your own secure, personalized account to store shipping and billing addresses that you may wish to use on a recurring basis. This convenience will avoid your having to provide us with the same information on subsequent purchases. You will always have the right to access, modify or delete information in "Your Account." 

We do store specific shipping information off of our Site, on our Order Database to be used solely for processing your order. We do not share, sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

From time to time our Site requests information from users via surveys or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. This information will be used to notify winners and for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our Site. 

Any links to third party websites on our Site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. We have not reviewed all of these third party sites and do not control and are not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policy. We accept no responsibility for web sites or other information, practices or products of other parties linked to the Website. Your dealings with persons found via the Website are between you and such persons and we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of such dealings. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk. 

**Cookies**

SECURITY 

**Our Commitment**  
Lulu Guinness is committed to using our best efforts to ensure the security of your transactions on www.luluguinness.com (the "Site") and protecting the privacy of the information you chose to share with us. By choosing to visit our Site, you are accepting the practices, terms and conditions described in this Security and Privacy policy. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have regarding these policies. 

References to "we", "us" or "our" throughout the Site are to Lulu Guinness. The use of the Site and the purchase of any goods from the Website is governed by these terms and conditions. We reserve the right to modify these terms and conditions from time to time without notice to you. 

There is no charge imposed by us for accessing the Website but you must pay the cost of the communications link you use to visit the Website. Access to the Website may be suspended, restricted or terminated at any time. 

**Secure Ordering**  
We make every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Lulu Guinness. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your credit card information, to your password and to your computer. 

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can't access the secure server for whatever reason, please email us at [technical@luluguinness.com](mailto:technical@luluguinness.com) and we will do our best to help.
