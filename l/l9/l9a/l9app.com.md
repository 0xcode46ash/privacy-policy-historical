Level 9 Marketing encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Level 9 Marketing so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information.

## Use of your Personal Information

Level 9 Marketing does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Level 9 Marketing may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Level 9 Marketing may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

## Use of Cookies

The Level 9 Marketing Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Level 9 Marketing pages, or register with Level 9 Marketing site or services, a cookie helps Level 9 Marketing to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Level 9 Marketing Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Level 9 Marketing features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Level 9 Marketing services or Web sites you visit.

## Security of your Personal Information

Level 9 Marketing secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Level 9 Marketing secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Changes to this Statement

Level 9 Marketing will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Level 9 Marketing encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Level 9 Marketing is protecting your information.
