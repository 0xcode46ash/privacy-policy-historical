# Privacy Policy – LRN

**LRN CORPORATION PRIVACY POLICY**

LRN Corporation (“LRN” or “Company”) is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This Privacy Policy, which is effective as of August 12, 2016, describes LRN’s privacy practices for both the web site located at **[www.lrn.com](http://www.lrn.com/)** , the Customer Web Sites which LRN creates, configures and hosts on behalf of its customers, and any derivative products which are developed to work either remotely or on a mobile/tablet device. The ownership of the data on LRN’s Customer Web Sites or mobile/tablet apps is subject to agreements entered into between LRN and each of its customers.

LRN’s data privacy and data security practices implement best practices for the protection and security of personal information, and also implement the requirements prescribed by the United States and the European Union (“EU”) under the EU/US Privacy Shield Program – which provides compliance guidance for U.S.-based organizations in connection with the European Union’s directives on the protection of the personal information of EU data subjects.

**LRN’s COMMITMENTS UNDER THE EU/US PRIVACY SHIELD PROGRAM**

LRN adheres to the Privacy Shield principles set forth at [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/), which are summarized below:

1\. Notice: LRN will inform EU data subjects of the Company’s data handling practices, which are set forth in this Policy.

2\. Choice: LRN offers individuals the opportunity to opt out if their personal data is to be disclosed to a third party (except agents), or used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized. To be clear, as a matter of strict policy, does not use personal data for any purpose that is not expressly disclosed, and agreed to, by LRN’s customers.  
3\. Accountability for Onward Transfer: If LRN needs to transfer personal data received from the EU to a third party, LRN will enter into a written contract with that third party which will contain specific provisions for the protection of that personal data.

4\. Protection of Personal Data: LRN will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

5\. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation: LRN will limit its collection and processing of personal information to that which is relevant to the purposes of the processing; will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, and is accurate, complete, and current; and will retain personal data only for as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose of the relevant processing.

6\. Access: LRN will provide relevant EU individuals with access to the personal data the Company holds about them, as well as the ability to correct, amend, or delete information which is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield.

7\. Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability: LRN is subject to the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission, which has the right to enforce LRN’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Program. In addition, in order to further ensure LRN’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Program, LRN has a contract with an independent recourse mechanism, [JAMS ](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield)(an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the US, with several locations in the EU), which is available – at LRN’s cost, and at no cost to the individual – to address unresolved complaints regarding LRN’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Program.

Any questions, complaints, access requests, and other issues arising under the Privacy Shield Program, under the US/Swiss Safe Harbor framework (to which LRN has also self-certified), or under LRN’s Privacy Policy more generally, should be directed to LRN Corporation, Legal Department, 745 5th Avenue, 8th Floor New York, NY 10151, Phone 646.862.2049.

**Information Collection & Use**

**Customer Web Sites**

LRN provides online knowledge, training, management and other services to employees of LRN’s customers and others designated by LRN’s customers to participate in LRN’s programs (“Users”). LRN’s customers are typically businesses or other organizations. LRN typically provides its services via Customer Web Sites, computer based application, and/or mobile/tablet application that LRN creates, configures, hosts, and supports on behalf of customers. LRN operates its programs and collects and uses data about Users at the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of LRN’s customers.

LRN’s arrangements with its customers may require LRN to obtain certain personal information about Users, either from the customer or a User, in order for a User to access the online knowledge, training and other services provided on a Customer Web Site, computer based application, and/or mobile/tablet application. Among other things, LRN may collect the following data: (i) User name; (ii) User identification; (iii) User password; (iv) User email address; and (v) User department(s) and location within the customer organization. LRN may also track the amount of time a User spends on the Customer Web Site, the applications the User employs, the self-tests the User performs, the User’s performance on such tests, and other activities in which the User engages while the User is on the Customer Web Site.

LRN only uses personal information to provide feedback about a User’s activity on a Customer Web Site. For example, LRN may use personal information to inform a User of his or her performance on tests, or the number of training modules that a User has used. LRN may also use personal information to send e-mails to a User, such as reminder e-mails that the User has not completed certain online courses.

LRN’s arrangements with its customers require LRN to provide all User information in LRN’s possession, including a User’s personal information, directly to the customer with which the User is associated (i.e., the User’s employer). If a User corresponds with LRN, LRN may keep a record of that correspondence. LRN may also forward correspondence to the customer with which the User is associated. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. LRN does not transfer any personal User information to any third party (other than to the LRN customer with which the User is associated) unless it is authorized to do so by the customer with which the User is associated, in connection with the services that LRN provides to the customer, or required to do so by applicable law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process – or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
