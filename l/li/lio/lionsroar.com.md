For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.

We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn how to modify the way it treats cookies.

If you turn cookies off, some features will be disabled that make your user experience more efficient and some features may not function properly.

## **Third-party disclosure**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties without your consent. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests from jurisdictions inside or outside of the United States where we believe in good faith that the response is required under local laws of that jurisdiction, applies to users from that jurisdiction, and is consistent with generally accepted international practice.  We may also share information when we believe in good faith belief that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Service.
