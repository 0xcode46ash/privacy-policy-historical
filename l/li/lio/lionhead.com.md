**What information does LSL collect?**

LSL only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis. When you submit personal information to LSL, it will usually take the form of: (1) competitions and promotions; (2) customer support; (3) online community forum membership; and/or, (4) online submission of your resume/CV for job openings. The information we collect may include personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and home address. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as your age, gender and interests. 

**\- Competitions and Promotions**  
LSL may collect some personal information from you including your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and birth date. This information will be used only for the purpose of your participation in product-specific competitions and promotions, as well as informing you of upcoming products. 

**\- Customer Support**  
LSL may collect some personal information from you including your name, e-mail address and birth date. This information will be used only for the purpose of solving your customer support inquiry and will be saved for twelve (12) months in the event additional customer support requests arise. 

**\- Forum membership**  
LSL may collect some personal information from you including your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and birth date. This information will be used only for the purpose of your participation in LSL operated online community forums (which may include chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups). 

**\- Resumes/CVs**  
LSL allows for the online submission of resumes/CVs. Personal information collected from resumes/CVs will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within the company. LSL uses a third party recruitment agent (external to the LSL group) to manage all LSL recruitment. Any resumes/CVs submitted directly to LSL will be forwarded to our nominated recruitment agent. By submitting a resume/CV directly to LSL you agree to LSL forwarding your CV to our nominated recruitment agent, in the knowledge that your resume/CV will be treated as confidential. Neither your resume/CV or any of its contents or the fact of submission will be communicated either by LSL or our recruitment agent to any other third party without your prior express written consent. 

Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfil your requests and our legitimate business objectives.   
  
**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?**

If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to (1) participate in certain competitions and promotions, (2) download demos of games, and/or (3) participate in online community forums. In addition, your refusal to submit personal information may limit our ability to respond to your customer support enquiry in a timely fashion. However, you do not need to provide personal information to LSL in order to access and/or use basic services provided LSL Web Sites.   
  
**Does LSL use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

LSL uses cookies on LSL Web Sites. A ‘cookie' is a small bit of record-keeping information that Web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are used only to quickly identify your computer and to ‘remember' things about your visit, which will allow us to speed up your activities and save time you might otherwise normally have to spend during your visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. 

We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. All messages posted to the discussion board have their IP logged, in case of abusive behaviour.   
  
**Who is collecting my personal information and how will it be used?**

Personal information that you submit to LSL will be collected and used by LSL as set forth in this policy. 

From time to time, however, LSL may employ third-parties to collect personal information on LSL's behalf and/or where competitions or promotions are concerned your information may be shared with the third parties responsible running/operating the competition or promotion. Such third parties may also provide internal support to LSL Web Sites by operating some of the services we provide you. Hence, to participate in a competition you may be asked to supply your name, address, email address, and/or other personal information. Although these third-parties, not LSL, may collect or receive the personal information you provide when registering, LSL still requires that they adhere to LSL's stated privacy policies.   
  
**With whom does LSL share my personal information?**

LSL does not share your personal information with outside third parties, save in certain cases such as where a competition or promotion is being operated by LSL in association with a third party where the third party in question may have access to your registration details. Please note that where competitions or promotions are concerned, your personal information may be transferred to the USA as some of the relevant third parties are based in that country. Although these third-parties may have access to the personal information you provide, LSL still requires that they adhere to LSL's stated privacy policies.   
  
**Can I choose how my personal information is used?** **How do I access and/or amend my personal information?**

If for any reason you wish to view, amend or delete personal information collected about you simply visit the following URL: [http://register.lionhead.com](http://register.lionhead.com/).

Alternatively, you may contact [registration@lionhead.com](mailto:registration@lionhead.com) and we will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate.   
  
**Does LSL collect personal information from children under 13?**

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address from children under 13 years of age, without the prior express written consent of their parent or legal guardian. 

We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without their parents or legal guardian's permission, when on-line. Children between 13 and 18 years of age should encourage their parents to review this privacy policy and to contact us if they would like to invoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.  
  
**What safeguards does LSL use to protect my personal information?**

LSL ensures data quality such as the accuracy of information obtained from our website visitors. LSL has also taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. Access to all personal information is strictly controlled. In addition, we take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who collect personal information on our behalf provide sufficient protection of personal information.

Any questions or complaints about this Online Privacy Statement can be resolved by addressing written inquires to Lionhead Studios Ltd, 2 nd Floor, One Occam Court, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7YQ, UK ( Fax: (+44) (0) 1483 401001) marked Attn: Legal Department .
