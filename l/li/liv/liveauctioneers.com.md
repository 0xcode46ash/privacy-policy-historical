##### Business Transfers

We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

#### How You Can Access, Manage, and Correct Your Personal Data

You can update the personal data associated with your account by visiting your [Account Settings](https://web.archive.org/dashboard/profile). You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from LiveAuctioneers in Account Settings. Some of these messages, such as transactional messages or legal notices, are required.

To delete or request a downloadable copy of your personal data from LiveAuctioneers, contact us at [info@liveauctioneers.com](mailto:info@liveauctioneers.com). We may retain certain data as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.

#### Your Legal Rights

You have the following rights under data privacy laws with respect to your personal data:

  * Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  * Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  * Request to restrict processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  * Request transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  * Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  * Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.



To exercise any of your rights, refer to the section “How You Can Access, Manage, and Correct Your Personal Data” in the Privacy Policy or contact us at [info@liveauctioneers.com](mailto:info@liveauctioneers.com)

#### Data Security

The security of your personal data is important to us. We use industry-standard technical and organizational practices and procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, and destruction or damage. Additionally, we limit access to your personal data to employees and third parties who have a business need to know.

#### Data Retention

We will retain your data as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you services. We will also retain and use this data as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligation, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and protect LiveAuctioneers’ legal rights.

We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized, or pseudonymized data which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Online Platform, improve our Services, or comply with legal obligations.

#### International Transfers

LiveAuctioneers is headquarted in the United States and has affiliates and service providers in other countries. Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us and our affiliates and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

References to “personal data” in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to “personal data” governed by European Union data protection legislation. We use the following safeguards if LiveAuctioneers transfers personal information originating from the European Union to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:

  


##### E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield

LiveAuctioneers complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. LiveAuctioneers has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. Our affiliated entities as follows also adhere to the Privacy Shield principles: Jasper52. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

We are responsible for the processing of personal data received under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequent transfers to third parties acting as agents on our behalf. LiveAuctioneers complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, LiveAuctioneers is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We commit to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities and comply with advice given by such authorities with respect to any human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact LiveAuctioneers at info@liveauctioneers.com. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy you will be notified via email (if you have an account where we have your contact information) or another manner through the Service that we believe reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new privacy policy on our Online Platform–or a specific announcement on this page or on our blog).

Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
