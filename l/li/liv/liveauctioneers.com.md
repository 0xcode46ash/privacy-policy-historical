### OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We use your personal information to facilitate the services you personally request. Your contact information and bidding history will be passed onto the Auction Companies during the auction sign-up process for them to make a decision whether you are able to bid in their auction. We also use your personal file information and activity information to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce applicable agreements; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. 

Providing us with your personal information indicates that you agree to our use of any personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services.

We use your information to improve and personalize our Site so as to make it easier, safer, and quicker to use. 

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communication and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced under certain circumstances to disclose personal information to the government or third parties, unaffiliated parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communication, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information collected from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communication will always remain completely private.
