# LiveOffice Managed Messaging Services Privacy Policy

LiveOffice LLC (LiveOffice) is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you.

### Information Collected

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address.

We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

### Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive electronic annual reports or to be added to our supplier diversity database).

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).

If you purchase one of LiveOfficeâ€™s products, we may use this information to provide you with custom information about LiveOffice's offerings in support of your business needs. For example, a technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

### Links to Other Sites

LiveOffice's Web site may contain links to other sites such as LiveOffice vendors and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

### Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those LiveOffice workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

### Contacting Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please use the Contact Us page. We welcome your questions and suggestions about our privacy policy.

### Changes to this Policy

Please check this privacy policy periodically to inform yourself of any changes. Although we reserve the right to modify or supplement this privacy policy, we will provide notice to you on this Web site of any major changes.
