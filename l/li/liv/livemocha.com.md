# Livemocha: Learn Languages and Practice with Native Speakers: Users

Welcome to LiveMocha.com (“Site”), an online service designed to provide language learning content, language learning curriculum, and to facilitate language exchanges and foreign language practice.  LiveMocha.com is owned and operated by LiveMocha, Inc.  LIVEMOCHA, INC is committed to safeguarding your privacy, and this privacy policy explains our data collection, use, and disclosure practices.  If you have specific questions about these practices, please contact us by email at postmaster@LiveMocha.com.

## 1\. Information Collected   

When you register with LiveMocha.com, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your spoken and learning languages, your gender, and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us. 

When you use LiveMocha.com, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, enroll in events and courses, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

You can choose not to provide this information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register and participate in the features offered through the Site.

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. LiveMocha.com may attempt to send invitations more than once. LiveMocha.com stores this information to send email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at postmaster@livemocha.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit the Site.  For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring web site.  We also may collect information about your activity on this Site, such as the courses in which you enroll.  One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help improve your user experience.

Finally, when you visit the Site, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to remember who you are.  For example, if you register on the Site, we may record your username in a cookie for verification purposes.  We also may include other information in our cookie files; for example, if you arrived at our Site via a link from third party site, we may include the URL of the linking page.

Please note that, at this time, the Site is not designed for children under 13 years old.  Accordingly, LIVEMOCHA, INC will not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children under 13 through the Site.

## 2\. Use of Personal Information

We will use personal information about you for the following general purposes:  to provide you with the products and services you request; to respond to your questions and comments; to communicate with you via regular mail and email (or other electronic means) about our programs and services; to measure interest in and improve our services and Site; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and otherwise as described to you at the point of collection. 

Please review “Your choices with respect to the Collection and Use of Personal Information” below.

## 3\. Disclosure of Personal Information

We display your profile information (minus your email address and password) to people browsing for friends, and to support other Site functions.  We also may disclose your personal information to the following entities:

(a)    Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including customer service, business analytics, marketing, and services to us in connection with operating the Site.  These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

(b)   To business partners with whom we may jointly offer a product or service offering. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners;

(c)    When advisable or necessary to conform to legal and regulatory requirements;

(e)   In connection with a change of control or operations, including without limitation in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, restructuring or any other transfer of LIVEMOCHA, INC's assets, or a transfer of the Site operations. 

Please note that when you provide LIVEMOCHA, INC with personal information through the Site, the information will be housed on servers located in the United States.  

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.  For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Site.  This information does not contain any personal information and is most often used to develop content and services that we hope you find of interest.

## 4\. A Special Word About Chat Rooms and Email

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others.  By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

## 5\. Access To Personal Information

You may obtain a copy of any personal information about you that you provide through the Site or otherwise request that LIVEMOCHA, INC update or make changes to such personal information by sending an email to postmaster@LiveMocha.com.

## 7\. Security

While no web site can guarantee security, LIVEMOCHA, INC has implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect personal information.  For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.

## 8\. Children Under 13

As noted above, the Site is not intended for use by children.  Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that the Site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we will delete that information from our records.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at postmaster@livemocha.com

## 9\. Third Party Websites

Web sites to which this Site links do not operate under this Privacy Policy.  We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. 

## 10\. Third Party Advertising

Advertisements that appear on LiveMocha.com are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. LiveMocha.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LiveMocha.com unless you choose to share it with them. 

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by LiveMocha.com and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

LIVEMOCHA, INC may update this Privacy Policy in the future to reflect changes in our privacy practices, our website functionality, or applicable legislation, so please check back often.  We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on the Site.
