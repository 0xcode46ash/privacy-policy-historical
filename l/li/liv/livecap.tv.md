# — Privacy Policy

Effect on [ Jan, 1st ], 2016

Welcome to the web site [www.livecap.tv](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livecap.tv&t=NmFiNjU5NzZkMmIzNmNhYmJmMGQ0YWZiOWYyMjE0ZDg1MDAyNzMyMyxkV3FPTEQ2TA%3D%3D) , and any other web sites, applications, or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “LiveCap Service”), which sites, applications or services are operated or produced by LiveCap Interactive, Inc. (“LiveCap” or “We”). LiveCap values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the LiveCap Service (collectively or individually, “You” or “Users”) and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in your LiveCap account setup, or by using the LiveCap Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice.

This Privacy Policy applies to LiveCap’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name, address, phone number, or email address). It also describes generally LiveCap’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).

The Information LiveCap Collects

User-provided Information : You may provide to LiveCap what is generally called “personal information” in the USA and elsewhere or “personal data” in the European Union (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number, credit card number and billing information) if you register for a LiveCap Service, or upload, purchase, view or download certain content or products from the LiveCap Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the LiveCap Service.

“Cookies” Information: Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.

Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.

This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.

“Automatically Collected” Information: When you access the LiveCap Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies and other types of tracking technologies. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“ IP Address ”), a unique user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language, referring and exit pages, platform type, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the LiveCap Service, the number of clicks, the amount of time spent on pages, the dates and times that you visit the LiveCap Service, and other similar information. Depending on the law of your country of residence, your IP address may legally be considered personal information.

Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the LiveCap Service, such as advertisers or social media networks for which you have approved our access to information (e.g., information from your Facebook account provided by the Facebook APIs). When you access the LiveCap Service through social media networks or when you connect a LiveCap Service to social media networks, you are authorizing LiveCap to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain information from third parties such as social entertainment platforms regarding your use of such services, including about your use of the content you choose to broadcast through the LiveCap Service. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the LiveCap Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When LiveCap Discloses Information

LiveCap does not share your personal information with other organizations for their own marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the LiveCap Service - such as when you publish content, comments or profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.

If you connect to a third party service (such as Facebook or Twitter) through an icon or link on the LiveCap Service or otherwise link your LiveCap account with a third party service, we may share the contents of your post and associated information (such as your user name, the fact that your connection originated from the LiveCap Service, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party. With your one-time consent, we may also send information about the content you watch and your activities on the LiveCap Service to such third parties. Once such information is shared, the use of your information will be subject to that service’s privacy policy and this Privacy Policy will not apply.

LiveCap may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personal information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of LiveCap.

LiveCap may make both personal and non-personal information available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are under common ownership or control within the LiveCap family.

We may disclose both personal and non-personal information to service providers working on our behalf to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfil orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist LiveCap in improving the LiveCap Service and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize them to use the information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.

LiveCap may disclose User information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with US state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or other applicable laws around the world (for example, in the country of your residence); or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner legally required by the requesting entity.

LiveCap also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith and after making reasonable enquiries, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability to LiveCap; protect LiveCap from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations to protect the security or integrity of the LiveCap Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LiveCap, our Users, or others. We will notify you of these disclosures if we reasonably think we can do so legally and without harming the purpose of the disclosure.

You may, of course, decline to share your personal information with LiveCap, in which case LiveCap will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the LiveCap Service. If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us as outlined in the last section of this Privacy Policy titled “LiveCap Contact Information ”; or using the mechanism provided below. In your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify clearly what information you would like to access, change, update, or suppress. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and any information you give us will be protected by this Privacy Policy.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

Advertisers and Analytics Providers

We may use third-party Web analytics services on our site, such as Google Analytics. These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the LiveCap Service. The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the LiveCap Service. Because these opt outs are cookie-based, please note that if you get a new computer or device, install a new browser, or erase or alter your browser’s cookie file, you may need to opt out again.

LiveCap may allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the LiveCap Service. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in personalizing the advertising content delivered to you. LiveCap does not provide your personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks LiveCap to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers.

Our Commitment to Data Security

LiveCap uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical measures designed to protect the integrity and security of your personal information. However, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot therefore ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LiveCap, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

In the Event of Merger or Sale

In the event that LiveCap or some or all assets related to the LiveCap Service are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
