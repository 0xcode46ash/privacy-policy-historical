**Collection And Use Of Your Information**

When you visit our websites, we may collect certain information from you. This information falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you log into our Websites and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate our sites.

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:** We may retain and use for our business purposes (including to contact you) personally identifiable information you provide to us.

**Tracking Information:** We may use technologies to track your use of our websites and tailor your web experience.

**Use of Cookies on Our Websites**

Cookies are small, unique strings of code stored on your computer that make it easier for you to use our site and help us improve site functionality and security. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).

We use our own proprietary cookies, as well as cookies hosted by third party vendors. These cookies include non-personally identifiable information that allows advertisers and content owners provide a more customized web experience. They may be used to tailor ad content on our site as well as on sites you may visit in the future. They may collect data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, and other clickstream data. (These first-party cookies, targeted at our customers and site users, are different from the cookies we deploy through the LiveRamp service, which may capture browser data including but not limited to your IP address, browser version, OS type, etc. We do not however collect information regarding clickstream, browsing behavior, or web page keywords. To learn about those cookies, go to <http://liveramp.com/data-privacy-policy>.)

When you visit our web sites or open an email you have received from us, we or one of our ad partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies, which do not contain personally identifiable information, enable us to send you ads about our services, customize our services and gather analytics about our web traffic. Additionally, emails we send to you may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code helps us understand the time and date that a user has opened an email and when he/she has used a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic, customize our services, and send you ads about our services. You can disable our web beacons by turning images "off" in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.

We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your computer when you visit our sites, and automatically store it in log files. This may include the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

Your browser may permit you to reject or delete cookies, but this may prevent proper working of our website. If you want to opt-out of receiving some advertising cookies, please visit [http://aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/ "http://aboutads.info") or [http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp "http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp")

Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on our behalf, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

**Disclosure Required By Law:** Under certain circumstances personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. If we are ever legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information we have unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.
