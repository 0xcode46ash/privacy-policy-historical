# LiveRamp | Advertising Data Privacy Policy

**LiveRamp Advertising Data Privacy Policy & FAQs**

LiveRamp is helping to create a more personalized experience for the online community. To carry out this vision, LiveRamp helps bring demographic and interest information online into anonymous cookies.  This enables ad networks and content providers to personalize messaging and offers to consumers, and improve users’ online experience.

We believe consumers should have transparency, choice, and control when it comes to their personal information.  Privacy and security are fundamental design requirements in our technologies and services and core to our business practices and operations. The purpose of this privacy statement is to help our clients, partners and members of the public understand how LiveRamp works, and what measures we have taken to protect the privacy of the information we’ve been entrusted with.

**How does LiveRamp obtain the data it uses?**

LiveRamp works with data companies and major brands to put their datasets online, into anonymized, de-identified cookies.  We use our proprietary technology and datasets to do this, which includes data structured around individual email addresses, “mapped” or matched to personally and non-personally identifiable data. We’ve obtained this data from a variety of sources — primarily from reputable data compilers with whom we partner, but occasionally from other companies with rights to share user data, and from our own use of common crawl technology to collect online information that users have chosen to publicly share.  We combine and measure these datasets against each other, to ensure a high level of accuracy.

**Does LiveRamp collect information about users’ web usage?**

No.  LiveRamp cookies don’t collect any data about users’ web usage.   Ours is a “do not track” data model.

**How are LiveRamp cookies placed?**

When a user visits one of our partner sites, the publisher sends us an encrypted or “hashed” unique identifier that allows us to search the LiveRamp database to determine whether that user is in our database.  If a match occurs, we drop anonymous cookies that provide an aggregate profile of the user – reflecting general demographic data about a user (e.g., age range, income range, general interests).   This data may be from our proprietary dataset, or may be from the dataset of a data partner on whose behalf we drop cookies.

**Who uses the cookies that we place?**

The cookies we place may be accessed or used by brands, in order to reach their customers, including those in their loyalty programs.  For example, if you’re a member of a points program for an airline or hotel chain, our cookies may help those organizations to send you special offers.  Other cookies may be accessed by other brands that are simply trying to find a targeted audience for their product — based, for instance, on estimated income, age range, general location or general interests.

**How long do LiveRamp’s cookies last?**

LiveRamp cookies expire 180 days after they are set, unless they are renewed or refreshed (assuming there has been no opt-out). Third-party cookies may have different expiration dates.

**How do we use the data that we obtain from web publishers?**

The hashed data values that we obtain from web publishers are only used to deploy a cookie, as described above.   The web publisher data does not go into an informational database:  we do not want your audience data, or to know what websites your users are accessing.

In other words, we only use web publishers’ data as a way to place de-identified offline data into online cookies – not for anything else.

**How does LiveRamp respect transparency, choice and control?**

We know that transparency and user choice are essential to user privacy on the internet.

We also know that some online users prefer a less personalized or customized online experience.  These users can opt out of the LiveRamp database through LiveRamp’s opt-out, or through a number of other channels, including the Digital Advertising Industry’s opt-out platform at [http://www.aboutads.com](http://www.aboutads.com/ "http://www.aboutads.com").  Simply [click here](https://web.archive.org/opt_out "click here") to access our permanent opt-out tool.

We insist that our partners meet the same high standards.  We require our web publishers to employ robust notice and choice standards, and require our data and advertising partners meet their own respective industry standards, including the NAI Principles, DAA opt-out methods, and DMA Member Principles.
