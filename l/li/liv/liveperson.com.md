# Privacy Policy | LivePerson | LivePerson

At LivePerson, we believe that it is important to protect the privacy of those who use our services and visit and use our website. LivePerson endeavors to be in compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, including the EU Directive 95-46. As such we have obtained "safe harbor" status from the US Department of Commerce which entails adopting the data quality principles set forth in the EU data privacy directive. Please read on for more information about our privacy policy.

####  What does LivePerson do?

LivePerson is a leading provider of technology that facilitates real-time sales and customer service for companies doing business on the Internet. We are an Application Service Provider, or ASP, and we offer our proprietary real-time interaction technology as an outsourced service to our customers (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “ASP Customers”). Our ASP Customers use our services to engage and communicate with visitors to the ASP Customer’s website using our chat, email, voice and other services.  As an ASP, we collect information from end users on behalf of our ASP Customers via our communication services. We also collect information from users of LivePerson’s website at [www.liveperson.com](https://web.archive.org/) (“LivePerson’s Website”). Our methods for collection and use of information depend on whether the user is using LivePerson’s Website (a “LivePerson User”) or accessing our service on one of our ASP Customer's sites (an “ASP User”).

####  LivePerson Users

**What information do we collect from LivePerson Users?**

When the online customer service chat, email or voice communication first begins, LivePerson Users are asked to enter their name and other personal information to facilitate service with an operator.  We maintain dialogue transcripts of chats and emails.

After any chat or email session, the LivePerson User may be asked to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about our service. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. The surveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level).

Personal information such as that contained on a resume or curriculum vitae may be submitted to LivePerson’s Website in connection with a job application.

LivePerson Users in need of technical support are required to complete a form for purposes of defining and clarifying their technical support requests. When submitting a technical support request, LivePerson Users are asked to provide relevant identifiable information such as: email address, URL of their site and a description of the issue. Emails sent to LivePerson support are kept for problem solving purposes and this information is not shared with or disclosed to outside third parties.

We log browser information (e.g., Internet Protocol addresses and browser types) to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic information, and administer and optimize our services. We also log browser information in order to determine whether to deliver our communication service to a user on LivePerson’s website.  By engaging in a communication session or visiting LivePerson’s website, the LivePerson User consents to such logging and processing of IP addresses by LivePerson.  The LivePerson User’s browser may be set to limit or prevent any of the browser information described above from being transmitted.  If so, the LivePerson User’s ability to use any of our communication services with LivePerson may be compromised.

We also collect data through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site.

**How does LivePerson use information it collects from LivePerson Users and will LivePerson disclose such information to outside parties?**

We access the information we collect for certain purposes (for example, to aggregate the information, to monitor the use of the service during certain chats and for other lawful purposes). A LivePerson User's information, including personally identifiable information, will not be shared with anyone other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We do not sell, trade or rent the personal information that LivePerson Users provide.

If you submit a resume, curriculum vitae and/or job application via the LivePerson Websites, we may distribute and use this information throughout LivePerson (subject to applicable law) for purposes of considering you for employment with LivePerson.  We may also keep your information on file for future consideration.  

####  ASP Users

**What information do we collect from ASP Users?**

When the online customer service chat, email or voice communication first begins, ASP Users may be asked to enter their name and other personal information to facilitate service.  By providing such personal information, ASP User consents to LivePerson collecting and processing such personal information on behalf of itself or its ASP Customers.  Also, during the chat or email communication, the ASP User will enter into a dialogue session with an ASP User operator or third party operator.  We maintain dialogue transcripts of chats and copies of email communications.

After any chat, email or voice session, the ASP User may be asked to voluntarily complete an exit survey in order to allow the ASP Customer and LivePerson to obtain valuable feedback. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. The surveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level). The surveys vary by customer so that our customers may obtain feedback specific to their website and business, as well as feedback regarding our service.

We log browser information (e.g., Internet Protocol addresses and browser types) to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic information, and administer and optimize our services. We also log browser information in order to determine whether to deliver our communication service to a user on an ASP Customer’s website.  By engaging in a communication session or visiting the website of any of our customers, ASP User consents to such logging and processing of IP addresses by LivePerson.  ASP User’s browser may be set to limit or prevent any of the browser information described above from being transmitted.  If so, ASP User’s ability to use any of our communication services with an ASP Customer may be compromised.

**How does LivePerson use information it collects from ASP Users and will LivePerson disclose such information to outside parties?**

We access and use the information we collect for certain lawful purposes including, but not limited to, the following: to provide maintenance, support or other services to our customers, to aggregate information and data, to monitor the use of the service by ASP Users and ASP Customers and for other lawful purposes.

An ASP User's information contained in the dialogue transcripts and the exit surveys may be accessed by ASP Customers.  Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregated basis.

Personally identifiable information related to an ASP User will not be shared with parties other than the ASP Customer and, as necessary, third parties performing services on behalf of LivePerson, except as required by law. We encourage ASP Customers to post privacy policies on their sites and to ensure that their use of information will comply with their privacy policy.  

We do not sell, trade or rent the personally identifiable information that ASP Users provide.

####  Information Relevant to Both LivePerson Users and ASP Users

**How does LivePerson protect user information?**

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be fully and absolutely secure.  Our site has security measures in place designed to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We offer secure sessions for chat and email communications and surveys at our clients' option so that data passed between users and operators is encrypted.  To achieve this level of security, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between the user and the operator. All chat and email communications and all recordings of voice communications and all user data are maintained and archived on secure servers. Access to stored data is password protected and passwords are account specific. No customer is permitted to view data for another customer. We also use appropriate firewall technology within our facility to prevent unauthorized access. For another level of protection, all data is backed up daily, and archives are stored off-site in a secure location.

**What about "cookies"**

Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving passwords, lists of potential purchases, personal preferences regarding the use of the particular website and to make sure the user does not see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. Our site uses cookies to enhance the user's experience by allowing us to recognize a user's return visit to our own service.

Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if users would prefer not to receive cookies, they may alter the configuration of their browser to refuse cookies. If they choose to have their browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.

**Opt-Out Policy**

LivePerson gives users options where necessary and practical. Such choices include opting not to engage in chat sessions and opting not to provide identifiable information during chat sessions.

**Safe Harbor**
