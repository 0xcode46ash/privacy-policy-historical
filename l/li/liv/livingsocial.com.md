## Privacy Policy

Who we are and what we stand for:

Thanks for using LivingSocial, or if you’re just getting started, welcome! LivingSocial is all about organizing your different interests, browsing what your friends enjoy, and find others with the same interests as you. We hope we’ve created an experience for you that is useful, enjoyable, and takes your privacy seriously. We respect the privacy of our users and take great care with your information. 

Collected information:

Upon registering to become a member of LivingSocial, you submit information that may be personally identifiable, including e-mail, name, birth date, and gender. You may also choose to submit other information during your usage of LivingSocial such as pictures, interests, and a variety of other ways. We also may use a few pieces of non-personally identifiable information to help improve LivingSocial and your experience, including, but not limited to IP-based location and browser type. At the time of registration, you will be provided with several options to leverage existing social network accounts within LivingSocial. The social networks currently supported include Facebook, Bebo, MySpace, and Orkut. By opting-in and linking an existing social network account with your LivingSocial account, some of the data from that social network may be leveraged within LivingSocial. 

How your information is used:

Your information may be used to provide you with access to LivingSocial’s services and to enhance and customize your experience. Content-driven personal information, such as user-submitted photos and interests, may be used throughout the site. Due to the public nature of LivingSocial, we highly recommended our users select the information they will disclose carefully. Non-personally identifiable information such as IP-based location or browser type may be used in our statistical analysis of how our site is used. We may share your non-personally identifiable information with third-party service providers, including advertisers, in order to improve the products and services provided on LivingSocial. A full description of advertising policies can be found below. Use of non-personally identifiable information may also be used in widgets or applications that exist on social network sites such Facebook, Bebo, MySpace, and Orkut. Information will remain non-personally identifiable unless you opt-in to to using the widget or application in the relevant social network. Finally, we may disclose personal information when we believe we are required to do so by law or to protect the rights and property of LivingSocial, other customer’s rights, its affiliates or the public. If required, we may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies, lawful subpoenas, warrants, and court orders, or any official investigation by a relevant agency. 

Email policies:

You are in control over the types of emails you receive. By default, you will receive emails that we believe enhance the functionality of a product or service (e.g., a friend has recommended a book to you) and are transactional in nature. These emails can be modified via the email settings link. Periodically, we also may have the need to send out site announcements and are generally infrequent in nature and reflect significant user experience changes to the site. 

Your friends:

A key part of LivingSocial is about connecting your friends. You can invite friends through livingsocial.com or through partner sites with LivingSocial widgets or applications, including Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, and Orkut. As part of the invite process, we will share your name with your friend, so they know where the invitation is originating from. 

Children and COPPA:

Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use LivingSocial. If it comes to our attention through usage of LivingSocial that a user is under the age of 13, we will make all reasonable efforts to disable the user’s access to the site and comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
