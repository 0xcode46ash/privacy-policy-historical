**Privacy Policy**   
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors. This privacy policy tells you how we use personal information collected at this site. Please read this privacy policy before using the site. By using the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.   
**What information do we collect ?**   
We do not require that users provide any personally identifiable information to use our services. We don't ask for personal information.   
We may collect and use the following kinds of personal data: information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, operating system, referral source, length of visit, number of visitors and number of page views.   
We never collect personally identifiable information about users such as names, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers.   
Non-personally identifiable information such as IP address or browser type will be collected.   
We collect statistics using Google Analytics, and these statistics include: number of users, page views, countries, languages, browsers, keywords searched. We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html .   
This website does not deliver pop-up or spyware or viruses of any kind.   
**Cookies and web beacons**   
This website or the advertisers on the website may use cookies and/or web beacons to collect data in the ad serving process.   
A cookie is a small text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.   
A web beacon (also called a clear gif or pixel tag) is a 1x1 pixel .gif image that advertisers place on their webpages. When you visit these pages, the web beacons can send your browser type, IP address, and other basic information to a server so advertisers can analyze the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. If you'd like to opt-out of web beacon tracking, you can clear your cookies.   
However these cookies are not used to extract any information from you. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies. We do not track or monitor these "cookies".   
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.   
Our advertisers may send you cookies to collect data in the advertising serving process. Any information collected from users by advertisers using cookies within this website is not subject to this website privacy policy, but rather the privacy policy of the individual advertiser.   
**Google and the DoubleClick DART cookies**   
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).   
We may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Paris, you may see Paris hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does not track personal information about you. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx>   
**Policy amendments**   
We may update this privacy policy from time to time by posting a new version on our website.   
You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.   
**Third party websites**   
The privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy are for this website only. This website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third party websites. If you link to other websites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.
