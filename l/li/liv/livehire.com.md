##  Privacy Policy LiveHire's Privacy policy was last modified on: 23 September 2014

**G'day, welcome to LiveHire!**

This Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/transparency/terms) help guide decisions we make every day in our company, so we can help protect and empower all our Users while we fulfill our ongoing mission to create the first-ever Human Resources Marketplace, where anyone can anonymously find work opportunities and manage their professional lives. 

As you use our Services, we want you to be clear about how we use information, the ways in which you can protect your privacy at all times and how we help you in protecting your privacy. 

Among other things, our Privacy Policy explains:

  * What Personal Information we collect and why we collect it.
  * How we use and manage that information.
  * The choices we offer, including how you can access and update that information.



We recognize our responsibility to protect the Personal Information that Users entrust to us. We take security very seriously and work together with Users, developers and external security experts to design security into our products from the ground up. We believe that your account, your web resume and all your private information is secure with LiveHire, as we protect your identity, privacy and anonymity in the live labour market. 

Your privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to the Platform or a long-term User, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact).

### Privacy

We may use and disclose to any person any de-identified data (not personally identifiable) we obtain from Users’ use of the Platform, including statistical information of your use of our Services. You acknowledge that such data belongs to LiveHire and that we will have the right to use and disclose such data as we determine in our discretion. 

At any time you may opt out of receiving any communications from us, other than as necessary or desirable for the operation of our business (e.g. regarding the security or management of your Account or payment of fees, etc).

At this time, if you are a Worker then information you would be required to submit relates to your Industry and Operations, Profession and Specialties (IOPS), work history, education and qualifications, and personal details including (but not limited to) your name, password, address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, email address, date of birth and gender.

  * **Device information**   
We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number).

  * **Log information**

    * Internet Protocol (IP) address. As an automatic process, our webserver records a log file of IP addresses that access the Platform. We also collect IP address and other system information for purposes of statistical analysis and to maintain the trust and security of the Platform. We will not use IP addresses or other system information to identify a User unless we determine, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary to improve our services or to enforce compliance with our policies or agreements with Users to protect our Service, Platform, customers and others. Notwithstanding this, we gather only that information that is reasonably necessary for us to operate and improve the Platform and otherwise conduct our business.

  * **Unique application numbers**   
Certain Services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that Service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. 
  * **Local storage**   
We may collect and store information, including Personal Information, locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. 
  * **Cookies and anonymous identifiers**   
We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Platform, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with Services we offer through our partners, such as validation services (like ERMS or WorkPro), or Platform features that may appear on other websites. Cookies are used to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track User trends and patterns. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of our Platform may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. 



### Use of Personal Information

We use the Personal Information we collect from all our Services to enable us to provide, maintain, protect and improve these services, to operate our business and develop new services, and to help us protect you, the User, us, and the Platform. We also use this information to offer you specific and relevant information – like search results, IOPS, work opportunities and education recommendations, etc. 

We use Personal Information for our internal purposes (including administration, marketing, planning, product development and research) and to contact you to inform you about updates to the Platform and Services and provide information relating to transactions you may conduct on the Platform. If other Users of our Services already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publically visible information, such as – but not limited to – your name, surname, nickname, photo, images and base location. 

We may disclose your information as required by law. We will never rent, sell or provide your Personal Information to third parties without your consent unless required to provide, update or improve the Services or to enable a LiveHire Affiliate (for example a service provider to LiveHire performed by independent verifiers) to provide their services. Any Personal Information you agree to provide may be received by a third party and may be stored and used by that party according to their privacy policy. 

We may keep a record of your use of the Platform or Services and any communication between you and us. We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your User experience and the overall quality of the Services. We will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with Sensitive Information such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. 

We may combine Personal Information from our Services with information, including Personal Information, from other services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know – or from a LiveHire Affiliate – for example to provide Verification to your Resume data and personal information provided to us. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with Personal Information unless we have your opt-in consent. 

We will request your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set in this Privacy Policy. 

We may process Personal Information on our servers in, and may otherwise transmit or disclose Personal Information to one or more LiveHire Affiliates operating from, many countries around the world and/or in the cloud. We may also store and process your Personal Information on a server or transmit it to a LiveHire Affiliate located either inside or outside the country where you live and you consent to us doing so, even if the privacy laws regarding Personal Information are less stringent than the laws in your country. 

### Accessing, correcting and updating your Personal Information

To request access to Personal Information we hold about you, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact). If that information is incorrect, out of date or incomplete, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When requesting access or changes to your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request. 

We may reject requests that are unlawful, frivolous, vexatious, unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing existing practices), that we believe risk the privacy, health or safety of others, or would be otherwise be extremely impractical (for example requests concerning information on our backup systems or unique ID data on Users). 

Where we provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where in our opinion it would require a disproportionate effort or cost for us to do so. 

Where you correct, update or otherwise provide Personal Information, you represent to us that the information you provide to us is, having regard to the circumstances, accurate, up to date and complete, having regard to the purposes of the disclosure, and not misleading or deceptive. 

We aim to maintain our Services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Platform, our system may not immediately delete residual copies from our servers and/or may not remove information from our backup systems. 

### Information we share

We do not share your Personal Information with any other Person unless one of the following circumstances applies: 

  * **With your consent**   
We will share personal information when we have your consent to do so. For example, details such as your full CV, verification details, Linkedin or Facebook data, referral and reviews, other personal details, and attached documentation are shared when you accept an Employer Contact Request . Each recipient may retain and use your personal information according to their internal privacy policies, terms and conditions. We may also disclose some or all of your Personal Information when this is part of, or necessary for, the Services offered to the Users. For example Employers will gain access to your Personal Information at the acceptance of a Worker Contact Request and may choose to continue to access that information for an extended period of time, provided that they enter in an agreement with us in order to maintain these rights. Disclosure to credit card processing or other payment providers may also be required to enable payment of our fees. We are not liable for the misuse of your Personal Information by any other User or other third party, including an Employer. 
  * **With LiveHire Affiliates**   
We may share your Personal Information with LiveHire Affiliates for the purpose of providing, updating or improving the quality or performance of, our Services. This may include providing access to Personal Information to LiveHire Affiliates to validate, verify, analyse and view records of your Personal Information, employment information and education records. LiveHire Affiliates may be located overseas. 
  * **With domain administrators and Team Managers**   
Users may grant access to their User profile and Account to domain administrators and Team Managers. If your Account is managed for you by one or more domain administrators or Team Managers, such as Recruiters, then they will have access to part or all of your Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to: 
    * access or retain information stored as part of your Account. 
    * receive your Account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal processes or enforceable requests. 
    * restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings. 
    * view statistics regarding your account. 
    * change personal details and passwords. 
Please refer to your domain administrators or Team Manager privacy policy for more information. 
  * **For legal reasons**   
We may share or limit access to your Personal Information if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of, or restriction therefrom, the information is reasonably necessary to: 
    * comply with any applicable legal, regulatory or other administrative or governmental process, enquiry or action; 
    * enforce our Agreement with you or investigate any potential breach; 
    * detect, prevent, or otherwise address any potential fraud, security or technical issues; or 
    * protect against potential harm to the rights, property or safety of our Users, us or the public. 
If we are involved in or contemplate a merger, acquisition, asset sale, corporate restructure or other similar transaction, we may disclose certain information regarding the Platform and the Services, which may include Personal Information, to potential purchasers or investors. Where reasonably practicable we will do so subject to acceptable confidentiality obligations being granted to us. 



### Application

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the Services provided by us, but may not apply to some Services provided by a LiveHire Affiliate to which the privacy policies of that LiveHire Affliliate apply separately, where such policies to not incorporate the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We will work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our Users directly. 

Please note, you may choose to contact us in relation to a particular matter on an anonymous basis or using a pseudonym and, unless it is impracticable for us to do so or we will not be able to respond reasonably to your complaint, we will attempt to resolve your enquiry on such basis.

Revised versions will be available on the Website and will apply to your use of the Website, the Platform and the Services from the date of publication.
