**Secure Shopping**  


As an AOL Certified Merchant, we have agreed to abide by the principles outlined in AOL's Privacy Policy.

All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html). 

**Cookies**  
We use computer "cookies" only to assist us in identifying our valued returning customers and tracking items placed in their shopping carts. We store an identification number in your cookie that is only significant to LiveAquaria.com. No personal information is stored in your cookie. If you attempt to shop and have cookies disabled, we will not be able to remember items you have placed in your shopping cart. 

**JavaScript**  
We use JavaScript for many useful features such as instantly displaying backordered items, recalculating your order total when selecting a different shipping method and for displaying pop-up information for products and assistance throughout our site. Having JavaScript enabled isn't a requirement for using our site. However, these features are designed to enhance your online shopping experience and to make shopping online more convenient for you.
