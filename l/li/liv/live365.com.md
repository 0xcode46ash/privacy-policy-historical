[](https://web.archive.org/)

### 1\. Introduction

Thanks for choosing Live365!

At Live365, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. To do this we need to understand your listening habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.

That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.

### 2\. About this Policy

This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Live365. The Policy applies to all Live365 services and any associated services (referred to as the ‘Live365 Service’). The terms governing your use of the Live365 Service are defined in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms).

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.

The aim of this Policy is to:

  1. Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
  2. Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the Live365 Service; and
  3. Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.



We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please see the ‘How to Contact Us’ Section 13 below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the Live365 Service.

### 3\. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control

You may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency and access controls in our Privacy Center and Privacy Settings to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:

  * Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
  * Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
  * Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
  * Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
  * Right to Object -
    * the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
    * the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
  * Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
  * Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.



If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact us at privacy@live365.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity.
