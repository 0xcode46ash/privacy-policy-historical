                                Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 5th, 2014
We recognize that your privacy is important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes
LiveSchool’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information
when you access the LiveSchool website and blog (“Website”).
By accessing the Website, you consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
LiveSchool reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy, and if we do, any such changes will
be included on this page so current privacy information will always be available to you. The
Privacy Policy will also note the date on which it was last changed.
Personal Information
The only personal information collected by LiveSchool is personal information that is voluntarily
provided by users. We don't collect personal information without your knowledge. We don’t sell
your personal information to third parties. We will use your personal information to fulfill requests
made by you and for other business purposes of LiveSchool and any of its successors. We may
also use your personal information to send you marketing materials or other information about
LiveSchool and its products and services, or LiveSchool’s partners, advertisers, and other
parties, goods, or services that may be of interest to you.
An example of how we may collect personal information is in connection with signing up for an
account. The information you provide in registering for an account will be used by us to give you
the information or service you are requesting. We may also use your name, phone number,
email address, or home address to send you marketing materials and other information about
LiveSchool and its products and services, or LiveSchool’s partners, advertisers, and other
parties, goods or services that may be of interest to you. You may opt­out of receiving any
additional information by following the clear instructions at the bottom of each email to opt out of
future emails.
Transactional emails for the purposes of maintaining your account are not communication of
which you can opt out. If you would like to delete your account and stop receiving emails
pertaining to your LiveSchool account, email support@liveschoolinc.com with the subject line
“Cancel Account.”
Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our website is not intended for children
under 13 years of age. LiveSchool does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our Services. If
you learn that our Services are being used by a child under the age of 13, please contact us at
support@LiveSchool.com. If we become aware that we have collected personal information
from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
information.
Your California Privacy Rights


California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a
year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personally
identifiable information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as
well as the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to those parties. If you are a
California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an
email to support@LiveSchool.com.

We automatically collect and store certain non­personal information concerning the traffic to our
website and web applications, including, for example: the browser software you use and your
operating system; the date and time you access our sites; and the internet address of the site
from which you linked to our website or web application. We use this information as anonymous
aggregate data for business purposes such as to determine the number of visitors to different
sections of a website, to ensure the site is working properly, and to help us make the website
more useful. We also use this information to see where leads are generated from in an attempt
to better optimize our ongoing internet marketing efforts.

information to qualify for entry. Collected data from promotions, contests, or sweepstakes may
be used to process entries, send promotional materials, notify entrants, and may be shared with
other companies in connection with these activities.

Our website and web applications may contain links to other websites and may provide
opportunities to publish certain information to third party websites or social media platforms.
LiveSchool is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of that website, platform, or any
other linked services. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and
web applications, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects or
publishes personal information. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including
those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.

monetary transactions may be facilitated by a third party payment processor, in which case you
and/or LiveSchool would share your information, including information about your financial
accounts, with the processor, for this purpose. We encourage our users to read the privacy
policies of any third parties. LiveSchool is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
any third parties. If you have questions about what third parties are involved with our Services,
