Information that Listen360 Collects / Use of Collected Information**

Listen360 is not in the business of selling or otherwise distributing personal information.  Listen360 only shares information with third parties, such as our clients, as described in this policy or as described at the time the information is collected.  For example, Listen360 may, at the request of a client, ask for a respondent’s contact information so a client can follow up with the respondent about their feedback regarding that client.  We only collect personal information that is either voluntarily provided to us by the person who the personal information relates to (in the case of the Feedback Information and Prospect Information described below) or that is provided to us by our client (in the case of the Potential Respondent Contact Information described below).

The following is a description of the information that we collect (collectively referred to in this policy as the “ _Collected Information_ ”) and how we use the Collected Information.

  * If you are a client, we collect: (a) the name, business address, business phone and fax number, email address and other similar information for the contact person(s) who you designate as the contact for billing and other purposes for your account with us (“ _Account Information_ ”), and (b) information that you voluntarily provide to us with respect to the persons who have had an experience interacting with your business and to whom you direct us to solicit feedback regarding the person’s sentiment with respect to that interaction (generally, unless you direct us otherwise, this information comprises only the email address of the person to whom you want us to solicit feedback) (“ _Potential Respondent Contact Information_ ”).  We use Account Information and Potential Respondent Contact Information solely in connection with our performance of services for the client for whom the information was collected.  We will modify or delete any personal information in Account Information or Potential Respondent Contact Information provided to us promptly after our client’s request to do so but in no event more than 30 business days after the client’s request.
  * If you are a respondent, we collect your feedback regarding your sentiment with respect to the experience you had interacting with our client (“ _Feedback Information_ ”).  We use and disclose Feedback Information only to our client with respect to whom the Feedback Information relates in connection with us performing services for our client.  Additionally, at the direction of our client to whom the Feedback Information relates, we may publicly disclose your Feedback Information in any form of media without identifying you as the author of the Feedback Information other than the initials of your first and last name.  Please see the section below entitled “Feedback Information in Social Media Feeds and Sites” regarding additional ways that we may disclose Feedback Information.
  * We collect contact information voluntarily provided to us (for example, through our “Contact Us” page on our Listen360.com website) by individuals who express an interest in using the Listen360 Services for their business (the “ _Prospect_ _Information_ ”).
  * If you visit any of our Digital Properties, we employ various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and analytics software, that help us perform the Listen360 Services and better manage content on our Digital Properties (the “ _Digital Property Usage Information_ ”).  We use the Digital Property Usage Information to (i) measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics to monitor how the Digital Properties are being used in general, (ii) monitor the performance of the Digital Properties, and (iii) make the Digital Properties easier and more convenient to use.   Please see the following section for a more comprehensive explanation of how collect and use Digital Property Usage Information.

**_  
Web Beacons_** – We use Web Beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about our Digital Properties.  A Web Beacon is a tiny graphic object that is embedded in a web page or email and is usually invisible to the user but allows checking that a user has viewed the page or email.  Web Beacons may be used within the Digital Properties to track email open rates, web page visits or form submissions.  In some cases, we tie the information gathered by Web Beacons to the Collected Information.  For example, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails to potential respondents have been opened.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our services.
