This cookie, by itself, will not identify to us your e-mail address or who you are. If you decide to register for our services, Listen360 may collect additional information to provide you tailored offerings or content. In this case, Listen360 uses cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make your online experience more convenient. Cookies cannot be used to obtain data from your hard drive, obtain your e-mail address, or obtain personal identifying information about you. You may set your browser to notify you when your computer receives a cookie or to prevent cookies from being received by your computer. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality that we can provide you when you visit the Sites. Please refer to the technical information for your Internet browser for details regarding cookies.

  **3\. How does Listen360 use and disclose my Collected Information?**

  We use and disclose your Collected Information only in the following ways and in the manner described in Section 4 below:

* Developing and/or informing you of additional products or services that may be of interest

 

If you are providing us Survey Response Information, we will use and disclose this information in connection with providing services to our customers.

  We may share your Collected Information with third parties and our affiliated companies to:

* Perform services such as mailing, transaction processing and other services on our behalf in connection with our services to you;
* Share the Customer Survey Information with our customers in connection with the services that we provide to them;
* Respond to claims that your Collected Information violates the rights or interests of third parties; and

* If all or part of Listen360 is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, your Collected Information may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, Listen360 will take steps to assure that your Collected Information is used in a manner consistent with the Listen360 privacy policy in effect at the time of the transfer.
* By written agreement, we require those third parties with whom we share your Collected Information to adhere to our privacy standards and to use and disclose the information only for the limited purpose for which it was shared.

 

**5\. Will I receive email solicitations from third parties as a result of Listen360 use and disclosure of my Collected Information?**

  No. Listen360 does not disclose or share Collected Information for the purpose of marketing third party products or services to you.

  **6\. How is my Collected Information secured and protected?**

  We have taken precautions designed to protect the information that you share with us during login sessions from misuse, loss or alteration by using industry standard encryption, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security and you should take steps to protect your information and transmissions such as keeping your login and password secure and making sure you completely log out when you have finished using the Sites. We have security measures in place to allow only the appropriate Listen360 personnel and service providers access to your Collected Information. Our personnel and service providers who have access to your Collected Information are required to protect this information at all times. E-mails that you send to us and information that you send to use through a web submission form outside of a login session are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to Listen360. If your communication is of a sensitive nature or includes confidential information, then you may choose to send it to Listen360 by fax or regular mail instead at the fax number or address, respectively, indicated at the link “Contact Us” from the Listen360 home page. We may store your Collected Information indefinitely for our business records and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

  **7\. Can Listen360 revise or supplement the terms of this Privacy Policy?**

  Listen360 reserves the right to revise or supplement this Privacy Policy at any time. Listen360 will update the Sites to include such changes. The changes will be effective with respect to all Collected Information that you provide and that we gather about you after the revised or supplemented Privacy Policy is posted by a “Privacy Policy” link at www.listen360.com and the changes will also be effective with respect to any Collected Information that we previously gathered. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically to inform yourself of any changes.
