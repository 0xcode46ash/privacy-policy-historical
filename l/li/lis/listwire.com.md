  * To contact you by telephone if we are unable to connect via e-mail for any reason (for instance, if a technological difficulty prevents the teleconference from taking place)
  * To send you a follow-up e-mail after the sessions you register for. This follow-up will provide you with a recap of the session and will include URLs, contact information and other details related to the topics discussed.
