# Privacy Policy | Listrak

### LISTRAK’S PRIVACY POLICY

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices of Listrak, LLC (which is referred to as “Listrak”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). Please note that this policy in no way supersedes, replaces, or otherwise relates to the privacy policies of our customers. We have created this privacy policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your personal information. 

To report any abuse or violations of Listrak’s services, or to contact us with any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, email us at info@listrak.com or call 877.362.4556. 

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Listrak will never use, sell, share, disclose, or rent any internal or customer supplied data to any clients, prospects, or other third parties. Listrak is not an email list rental service. Our clients retain ownership and control of their lists at all times.

### Information Collection and Use

Listrak collects information at several different points on our web site in order to better serve client and visitor needs. For each visitor to our web pages, our web server automatically recognizes and collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information or email address related to permission-based subscription to our email alerts, enewsletters, and promotional emails, and logins to access portions of the site related to their Listrak account.

The information we collect is used to create demographic profiles of our subscribers, clients, and visitors so we can improve the content of our web site and email alerts. No information is shared with a third-party or any other organizations for commercial purposes.

In cooperation with our clients, Listrak collects lists of data including personal email addresses with the purpose of delivering permission-based email campaigns to those lists. Listrak hosts these client lists on our servers. 

Our hosted application works in concert with this privacy policy to ensure that no sharing or disclosure of list data including personal information can occur between clients or third parties. Listrak is contractually bound with each of our clients to maintain the privacy and integrity of their campaign data to include all personal information, tracking data, and analytical data.

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our web pages, and some of our partners and clients, utilize cookies and other tracking technologies, such as a single pixel gif, to record session information. Listrak uses single-pixel gif images to count web page accesses and gather some general statistical information such as if an email has been opened or read. Collected information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

### Links to other Web sites 

Listrak’s web site, or messages created with Listrak, may contain links to other web sites. Listrak is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Third parties may independently collect information about web site visitors when they view ads or other communications from third parties through Listrak products or services. If visitors do not want those companies to collect information about them, they should contact these companies directly.

### Confidentiality and Security

Listrak warrants that all customer data remains the property of our customers. We also will not use, rent, sell, transfer, or otherwise expose the contents of the tracking information resulting from click through, message opened, message read, or eCommerce conversions. Listrak provides an SSL encrypted, password-protected mechanism for viewing and extracting customer data. Listrak maintains all customer data in a carrier-class secure facility protected by firewalls and other security devices. These measures are designed to protect visitor and client information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.

Listrak uses a third party for credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided expect for the sole purpose of credit card processing. We restrict access to this information to only those employees who require the information for business purposes.

### Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM)

Listrak is committed to providing a permission-based model for email marketing. To that end, we carry a strict anti-spam policy for all of our clients. Listrak clients are explicitly prohibited from sending any unsolicited material to recipients who have not expressed their permission to receive communications from them. Additionally, Listrak services may only be used for lawful purposes and may not violate any local, state, federal or international laws. 

These policies are part of our broader reaching Acceptable Use Policy that each of our clients are contractually bound to. Violation of this policy will lead to a speedy termination of all access to the Listrak application, servers, and network.
