#### Information Collection and Use

Listrak collects information at several different points on our web site in order to better serve client and visitor needs. For each visitor to our web pages, our web server automatically recognizes and collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address, aggregate information on what pages visitors access, information volunteered by the visitor, such as name, email, phone and company information, email address related to permission-based subscription to our email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional emails, and logins to access portions of the site related to their Listrak account. 

The information we collect is used to send you requested product or Service information, respond to questions, concerns and customer support inquiries, send you emails, and create demographic profiles of our subscribers, clients, and visitors so we can improve the content of our web site and email alerts. 

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name and company information. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us using the information below. 

#### Information Related to Data Collected through the Listrak Services

Under the direction of our clients, Listrak collects lists of data including personal email addresses of third parties with the purpose of delivering permission-based email campaigns to those lists. Listrak hosts these client lists on our servers. We have no ownership of this information or any direct relationship with individuals whose personally identifiable information may be processed as part of providing our Services.

An individual who seeks access to their data, seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data or wishes to opt-out of communications from a Listrak Client should direct his/her query to the Listrak client he/she interacts with directly (the data controller). If a Listrak client requests that we remove personally identifiable information on their behalf, we will respond to their request within 30 days. 

Listrak may transfer personal information to other companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the Service agreements with our clients. 

Listrak will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide Services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Clients who use the Services offered on our Site may submit the personal information of other individuals at their organization to register them as authorized users and/or Account Associates. It is the client's obligation, as the data controller, to inform its authorized users about the purposes for which information about them is collected and may be used on this Service. Authorized users may update or remove their account information by logging into the Services platform and editing their account information, or by contacting their administrator. 

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Listrak will never use, sell, share, disclose, or rent any internal or customer supplied data to any clients, prospects, or other third parties. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. Listrak is not an email list rental Service. Our clients retain ownership and control of their lists at all times. 

Our hosted application works in concert with this privacy policy to ensure that no sharing or disclosure of list data including personal information can occur between clients or third parties. Listrak is contractually bound with each of our clients to maintain the privacy and integrity of their campaign data to include all personal information, tracking data, and analytical data. 

We may provide personal information to companies that provide Services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer Service and processing payments. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these Services to us and are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential. 

We may also disclose personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. 

If Listrak is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, 

#### User Access and Choice

If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, amend, remove, or ask to have it removed by making the change on your user account settings page, by emailing our Customer Support Team at support@listrak.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you no longer desire our Service, please contact us directly. We will respond to your request within 24 hours.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you Services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Opting Out

If you wish to subscribe to our email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional communications, we will use your name and email address to send them to you. Out of respect for your privacy, if you no longer wish to receive Listrak's email alerts, e-newsletters, and promotional communications, you can easily opt-out using the Unsubscribe link included in each communication, reply to the email requesting to be removed from the list, contact us at privacy@listrak.com, or call 877.362.4556.
