##  Privacy Policy 

Your privacy is important to us. Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade,” “our,” “us” and “we”) has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform users (“you” or “your”) and other visitors to our website about what information we collect about you and about your use of our website. It explains how we protect that information and what choices you have about how it is used. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you will understand clearly both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how we may collect and use information. By using the Limeade website, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a Limeade public forum (such as a web chats, blogs and community forums) is not protected by this Privacy Policy. Third parties not related to Limeade will see such postings. What you've written could be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. Also, in accessing a third party website from a link or search tool on Limeade or in accessing the Limeade website from a link on a third party website, any information you reveal on that website is not subject to this Privacy Policy. You should consult the privacy policies of each website you visit.**

The following describes the information we collect from or about you and the ways we disclose, use and protect that information. Our Privacy Policy is intended to give you a clear idea of how we protect and manage information about you.

**1\. Personally identifiable information we collect:**

_In General_  
Personally Identifiable Information (or Personal Information) is information that can be used to identify or contact you, as well as other personal data, including, without limitation, your assessment results and medical history. Limeade collects, stores, processes and maintains your Personal Information (whether it was provided to us by you while using our services or resulted from the actual use of our services). We also collect non-personal information from you and about your use of our website and the websites of sponsors and referral partners. As an example, Limeade may use “cookies” and/or “web beacons” to collect non-personal information about your use of our website or emails we send to you. Limeade does not use these cookies and web beacons across websites and Limeade does not store any Personal Information in any cookies on your computer. This is described in more detail below.

_Subscription and Registration Profile_  
In order to have access to certain services and content available on our website (such as wellness assessment, goal tracking tools and personal journals), you are required to complete a registration form. We use the Personal Information that you provide through registration to deliver relevant content and respond to questions from you and/or inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy. We may also use this information to send you emails with special promotions or newsletters with content that we think may be of interest to you. You can always opt-out of receiving email newsletters at the time you register or at any other time by clicking on the Email & Privacy tab on the Edit Profile page.

_Limeade Resource Tools_  
We also collect other information, some of which may be Personal Information, which you voluntarily provide to us when you choose to use some of the Limeade services, such as wellness assessments and goal tracking. This may include, but is not limited to, specific information regarding medical conditions, lifestyle, diet, exercise habits, drug and alcohol usage, workplace matters and other relevant Personal Information relating to your wellness. We also collect information you provide voluntarily through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like. 

_Surveys_   
On a regular basis Limeade may request information from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and it is your choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as gender and age). Personal information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice to you and you have the choice to opt-out of such information sharing programs.

_Cookies_  
Limeade collects anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our website and traffic to websites of sponsors and referral partners. For example, we collect non-personal information about your use of our website through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits a website and the activities they conduct while on that website (such as the pages you visited). Every computer is assigned a different cookie by Limeade. The information collected by cookies helps us dynamically generate content on web pages or in emails specifically designed for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website or opening our emails, and for what purposes. We may use non-identifiable cookie information to target certain program notifications to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content, sponsors or referral partners.

Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie, certain functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookie in order to productively use our website.

_Web Beacons_  
In limited circumstances we also may use “web beacons” to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our website. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the User’s browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website or opening our emails. Limeade web beacons are not used to track your activity across websites generally.

_Children Using Our Website_  
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our website is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect Personal Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.

_Corporate Customers_   
In many instances, our services are made available to end-users (like you) through the websites of our corporate customers (e.g., employers, health plans and consultancies). Unless we receive your permission, we do not share any Personal Information about you that we may collect with our corporate customers. However, we may share Aggregate Information (as described below) with such corporate customers. Such information is never disclosed in a level of detail sufficient to permit the identification of any particular individual. 

In addition, you should be aware that Limeade cannot and does not control the collection and usage of Personal Information by our corporate customers through mechanisms that are not within our control or supervision. We can offer no assurance that the privacy practices of such corporate customers will be similar to ours. To the extent that you are accessing our website through an employee or health plan beneficiary portal or other third party website, we strongly encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such organizations prior to providing information to us or them that you consider to be sensitive or personal in nature.   

**2\. What organizations are collecting information:**

_Third Parties_  
Sponsors and partners (including our corporate customers) identified on the Limeade website or in e-mails, special promotions or newsletters we send you may also use their own cookies or web beacons when you click on their link to their website or service. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website or server of our sponsor or partners or another third party acting on behalf of the sponsor or partner before re-directing your browser to its proper destination. This re-direction process will not be apparent to you.  
We do not control these third parties’ use of cookies or web beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our website to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites.

_Public Forums and Programs_  
This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you participate in a Limeade **public forum (such as web chats, blogs and community forums)** or provide Personal Information used in the production and broadcast of a program attended by third parties. As a service to our users, Limeade features bulletin boards and similar forums where users can share information or where users can post questions for experts or other community members to answer. You should be aware that any information shared in a bulletin board, online discussion, or other public forum is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum.

**3\. How the information we collect is used and with whom it may be shared:**

_Disclosure of Your Information_  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, Limeade will not disclose any Personal Information it gathers from you on our website. We may release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information to a third party, we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.

_Disclosure to Limeade Partners_  
In order to provide you with the services on our website, we may need to share your information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as incentive fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. They may also collect information on our behalf. In this use, a limited amount of your registration information is provided to these partners for purposes of fulfillment. This information is restricted in its use through contractual obligations with these companies and not used for any other purpose than to provide services to you on behalf of Limeade.

_Disclosure to Linked Sites_  
In addition to the third party websites that you may access as described above, for your convenience there are links to websites operated by companies other than Limeade (“Third Party websites”) that are not contractors who provide content or services through our website. These links may be found referenced within content on our website, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors and partners. Limeade does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party websites without obtaining your consent. Limeade does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. If you choose to link to one of these Third party websites, you should review the privacy policy posted on this other website to understand how that Third Party website collects and uses your Personal Information.

_Disclosure of Aggregate Information_  
Limeade may provide to third parties non-personal information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted and that is combined with the non-personal information of other users (“Aggregate Information”). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our website and the services they utilize while on our website. Depending on the circumstances of each instance, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We also may not limit the third parties’ use of the Aggregate Information, except that we do require third parties to whom we disclose Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable by combining it with other databases or otherwise.

**4\. What internal privacy and security procedures are  in place:**

While we do not engage in the practice of medicine or provide medical diagnoses or recommendations about the course of treatment for your particular circumstances, and do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, products, procedures, opinions, or information that may be contained in or linked to our website for your particular circumstances, we may in certain circumstances be subject to the rules and regulations applicable to “covered entities” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and it is our general policy to maintain your Personal Information in accordance with the HIPAA security rule and with Truste. 

All data is maintained in secure locations with access limited to authorized personnel. We do not sell or rent personal data to other companies. We delegate the task of physically safeguarding our repository of user data to the SolidSpace data center at 111 North Chestnut Street, Winton-Salem, NC 27101. The data center implements standard physical access security precautions such as locked access points. 

We encrypt sensitive data such as Personal Information data using SSL or VPN whenever it is transmitted over the Internet. However, we cannot completely ensure the privacy of e-mail communications to and from our website because they are not encrypted and, therefore, not secure. Inside the data center, electronic access is secured using standard Microsoft Windows operating system user/password authentication. Key passwords are rotated on a semi annual basis, and also when employees leave the company. In addition, employees are contractually bound to maintain the privacy of the data. 

In order to mitigate the possibility of loss in the event of an earthquake, flood, or tornado, the data center is physically located in a spot where those hazards are relatively unlikely. In addition, database backups are made regularly and encrypted versions of same are transmitted over the network and retained in a different location. In the event that it is necessary to recover previously backed up data, contact us at privacy@limeade.com. 

In the event of a hardware failure, contact SolidSpace, at (888) 340-0020 or support@solidspace.com. The data center is staffed weekdays between 8am (Eastern Time) and 6pm (Eastern Time), with designated on call person after hours. The computer vendor, Dell, will provide replacement parts within 3 days. Immediate failover is implemented for selected critical hardware such as the web servers. 

Compliance with security rules is periodically audited by our Chief Technology Officer and we continually assess the adequacy of, and where appropriate improve, our control and procedures.

Users are able to self administer key privacy settings via the website in order to keep their Personal Information private. If a user contacts notifies Limeade of incorrect Personal Information on the website, it will be corrected within 2 business days. 

We also work diligently protect your information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Limeade employees and our third party service providers must abide by this policy and those who violate it are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or other legal action as permitted by law.

Like other Internet sites, Limeade cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from individuals who might attempt to bypass security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet. Although we will make every reasonable effort to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that thieves could find a way to thwart our security systems.

**5\. What choices are available regarding collection, use distribution and correction of the information:**

_Right to Know and Opt-Out and Opt-In_  
We reserve the right to send you specific administrative notices about your registration or subscription or to contact you if required by law.

During program registration and at various times as you use the website, you may have the option of receiving emails or newsletters directly from third parties, participating in research or marketing surveys and participating in other activities. You may exercise these options by placing a check mark beside a statement that expresses a preference for receiving these communications or participating in these activities. In order to provide you with enhanced functionality and services, we may seek your permission to share your Personal Information with contractors and/or Third Party websites. You are not obligated to opt-in to such information sharing programs, although doing so will assist us in optimizing your usage of the Limeade website.

Additional information about our other services and products will be sent to you only if you have expressly chosen to receive such information. If you do not wish to receive website newsletters or additional information you may remove yourself from communication lists easily by following instructions within the newsletters.

You can always contact us in order to delete any of your Personal Information from our systems. You should be aware that, if our website was made available to you by a corporate customer that is sponsoring your usage of the website, your eligibility to receive promotional benefits from such parties, if any such benefits are offered, may be adversely affected by your election to remove your Personal Information from our systems. You must contact the sponsoring organization directly for further information.
