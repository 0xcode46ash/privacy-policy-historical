## Does Limos.com Share Personally Identifiable Information?

Information about our Customers is an important part of our business. We share customer information as described below:

The Limos.com, Inc. corporate family: We share information received through Limos.com and Limousinesonline.com within our corporate familyâ€”to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family may use this information to send you marketing communications if you've requested their services.

Limousine Company Suppliers (LC's): We share information with our third party LC's so that they may provide quote information, may communicate with Customers directly to provide service information (typically to answer Customer questions, describe the LC's services or reservation request) and provide the limousine service itself. When you request a quote, a reservation or ask a question of an LC, we share your "Customer Criteria" with the LC in order for the LC to provide you with the above information about their limousine service. Your "Customer Criteria" includes your name, your communication preference (email and/or phone call), any email or phone number you provided, your limousine ride type, vehicle preferences, dates/times and location of service and any special requests you submitted. Our LC's are prohibited by our Terms of Service agreement from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

Third Party Service Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf which may involve sharing information. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, processing credit card payments, operating our Jobs page, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but pursuant to our agreements, they must not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information

Legal Enforcement: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Limos.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

Public Forums: Our Web sites make discussion forums available to Customers where Customers can comment on and opine with respect to matters regarding the general categories in the limousine services industry.
