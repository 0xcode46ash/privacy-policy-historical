|  Privacy Policy  |   
|  |   
  |  Viperion Corporation ("VC") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (http://www.limos.com) and the related websites: http://www.limo-search.com and http://www.limousinesonline.com (such three sites being collectively referred to herein as the "Sites"). Please note that the Sites contain links to other websites. VC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites 

**Collection and Distribution of Information  
** In order to become a member of the Sites, a limousine company is required to complete a membership application, which includes information such as name, address, type of service offered, service area and credit card. This information is used initially to determine if a company qualifies for membership. 

If a limousine company's application for membership of the Sites is accepted, the company will be admitted into the Sites' Directory service ("Directory") and the Sites' limousine company finder service ("Finder Service").

In Directory, contact information (including a complete company profile and company website) for limousine companies in a buyer's geographic area is listed on a randomized basis. The buyer may send up to eight (8) selected limousine companies a service request containing details as to the limousine service requested by the buyer and details concerning the buyer. The recipient limousine companies are free to respond to the request by contacting the buyer.

In the Finder Service, the buyer submits a request containing details regarding the requested limousine service and details concerning the buyer directly to VC.  VC forwards this request to up to 15 matching limousine companies (selected on a random basis) in the buyer's geographic area. The recipient limousine companies are free to respond to the request by contacting the buyer.

The limousine company's credit card information is used to assess the annual nonrefundable access fees and the per lead fees which are required to be paid by limousine companies in order to participate in the Limos.com service (members are also sent an itemized statement of charges). The current fee is 99 cents per lead, USD.  VC actively engages in affiliate, partnership & alliance activities which could result in member companies being advertised on a network of sites outside of Limos.com and Limos.com's control.

VC does not sell, redistribute, or license the consumer information submitted by limousine companies or prospective buyers on the Sites. Nor does VC sell, distribute, or license the information contained within its databases, including its member list and consumer inquiries. 

All information obtained and submitted herein is only used in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

**Cookies  
** The Sites use cookies to keep track of your limo preferences, or "shopping cart". We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

**Public Forums  
** This Sites make a discussion forum available to its users where users can comment on and opine with respect to matters concerning the limousine industry. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in these areas, or in any other manner that is intended for display on the Sites, that information will be public information, and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond VC's control.

**Security  
** The Sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We operate an SSL technology to protect sensitive and/or financial information such as credit card numbers.  Credit card numbers are not stored on web or application servers. 

**Contacting the Web Site  
** If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of the Sites, or your dealings with any of the Sites, you can contact
