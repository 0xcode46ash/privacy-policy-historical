**LimeWire Privacy Policy** **Information Collection and Use**

LimeWire LLC ("LimeWire") is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. LimeWire collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

t o p **Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. At this time, LimeWire does not use cookies on our website. If and when we decide to incorporate cookies into our website, their use will in no way be linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

t o p **Log Files and IP addresses**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked by Lime Wire to personally identifiable information. However, users should be aware that both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information. 

t o p **Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

t o p **Links**

This web site and the Lime Wire Software contains and generates links to other sites and IP addresses. Please be aware that Lime Wire is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site or link to outside IP addresses and to read the privacy statements of each and every website and IP address that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site and by Lime Wire Software.

**Gnutella Network**

When you connect to the Gnutella network with the Lime Wire Software, certain information about you is available to others on the Gnutella network. Your IP address will automatically be sent to other Gnutella nodes so that they can make connections to you. However, no personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address) will be sent along with your IP address. Also, when you initiate a search or broadcast somebody else's search, your IP address will be sent to other members of the Gnutella network, along with the relevant search criteria. Because of the decentralized nature of the Gnutella network, it will be difficult for people receiving this information to determine whether you have initiated a particular search or whether you are simply passing it along for someone else. However, Lime Wire makes no guarantees as to the anonymity of searching the Gnutella network using the Lime Wire Software. Lime Wire maintains no record of the searches broadcast by any particular IP address; however, other people may be able to determine the origin of particular searches through analysis of the aggregate activity on the Gnutella network or through other means. 

t o p

Further, since the Gnutella network is a peer-to-peer file-sharing network, all information on the Gnutella network is information that is being shared voluntarily by other Gnutella network participants. If you elect to share information with the Gnutella network, this information might be viewable by anyone else on the Gnutella network. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SEEN BY OTHERS INTO YOUR SHARED PATHWAYS. LIME WIRE DISCLAIMS ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY UNINTENDED SHARING OF PRIVATE INFORMATION. BY USING THE GNUTELLA NETWORK AND/OR LIMEWIRE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE ASSUMING THE RISK THAT ANY INFORMATION ON ANY COMPUTER, SERVER OR DEVICE (INCLUDING A NETWORKED COMPUTER, SERVER OR OTHER DEVICE) YOU USE TO CONNECT TO THE GNUTELLA NETWORK MAY POSSIBLY BE HACKED, COPIED, DISCLOSED TAMPERED WITH OR ALTERED AGAINST YOUR WISHES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS PLACED IN A SHARED PATHWAY. LIME WIRE WILL TAKE REASONABLE TECHNICAL PRECAUTIONS AGAINST SUCH INTRUSIONS, BUT SUCH ATTACKS CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY PREVENTED ON A PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK SUCH AS GNUTELLA. 

t o p

BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU LINK TO AN EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS THROUGH THE LIME WIRE SOFTWARE AND/OR THE GNUTELLA NETWORK, YOU ARE DIRECTLY LINKING YOUR COMPUTER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER, SERVER, OR OTHER DEVICE. YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY HARM OR DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER, SERVER OR OTHER DEVICE (INCLUDING A NETWORKED COMPUTER, SERVER OR OTHER DEVICE) AS A RESULT OF LINKING TO AN EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS. 

t o p   
**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify registered users by way of an e-mail or instant messaging or similar method, and/or by posting a notice on our website.
