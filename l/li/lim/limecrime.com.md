**Information We Collect**

Personal information is collected when you sign in to Limecrimemakeup.com or limecrime.com, upon registration with Lime Crime, when placing an order, or when contacting us via phone or email. Additional personal identification information such as user name, password, billing information, and contact information may also be collected in order to offer you Lime Crime products and services. This information will be used to fulfill your orders, process your transactions, facilitate your use of our website, market our products and services, respond to your requests, assist you with future shopping, and improve Limecrimemakeup.com / limecrime.com. Choosing not to provide us with information will limit our ability to respond to your shopping needs. In addition, information such as your IP address and the site that referred you to ours will be gathered automatically. Because of the nature of the Internet, data may pass through any country and any jurisdiction, including jurisdictions where privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.

Unless you opt out of receiving promotional materials, we may send you information by email to the address you provided. From time to time we may notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or other information that may interest you. You may also receive notifications of special promotions, new products, or additional services from our third-party associates. If you would like to opt out of receiving correspondence, please send your request toÂ info@limecrimemakeup.com.

We do not rent or sell your personal information to parties not associated with fulfilling your order, unless sharing this information is necessary to provide you with Lime Crime products or is required by law.
