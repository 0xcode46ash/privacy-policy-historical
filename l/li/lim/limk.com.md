#### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Limk collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Limk’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Limk’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Limk may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Limk also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.

#### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Limk’s websites choose to interact with Limk in ways that require Limk to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Limk gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Limk are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Limk collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Limk. Limk does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

#### Aggregated Statistics

Limk may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Limk may monitor the most popular links or screen the links help identify spam. Limk may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Limk does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

#### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Limk discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Limk’s behalf or to provide services available at Limk’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Limk’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Limk will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Limk discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Limk believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Limk, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of an Limk website and have supplied your email address, Limk may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Limk and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Limk takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Limk uses cookies to help Limk identify and track visitors, their usage of Limk website, and their website access preferences. Limk visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Limk’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Limk’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

#### Business Transfers

If Limk, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Limk goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Limk may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

#### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Limk may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Limk’s sole discretion. Limk encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
