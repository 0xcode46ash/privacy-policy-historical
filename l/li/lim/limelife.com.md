##  LIMELIFE PRIVACY POLICY 

LimeLife is committed to protecting the personal information collected about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.

LimeLife provides this general audience site for users of all ages. Section 3 of this Privacy Policy contains specific details regarding personal information collected from children.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the Site, and does not apply to information that may be collected by LimeLife offline and is incorporated into our LimeLife [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630011157id_/http%3A//www.limelife.com/terms_of_use.php).

Your use of the LimeLife, Inc. ( **“LimeLife”** ) web site (the **“Site”** ), and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of California. LimeLife reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, update or modify this Privacy Policy and/or our [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630011157id_/http%3A//www.limelife.com/terms_of_use.php), at any time by posting such change, update or modification on the Site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. Please check this policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes will mean you accept those changes. Use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.

##  Information Collected and Use 

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features and content ( **“Services”** ) to enable users to navigate and enjoy the Site.

##  Personal Information 

In general, you can visit the Site without revealing any information about yourself that could identify you personally, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address, and telephone number(s) ( **“Personal Information”** ). LimeLife will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for any purpose without your consent. Following are the instances when we may collect and use your Personal Information:

  * Registration — When you register with us through the Site we may ask you for some Personal Information. LimeLife may use your Personal Information to send you information about LimeLife or our products, or to send you our newsletter or other information that may be of interest to you. During the registration process you are given the opportunity to opt-in to the receipt of such information from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information from us, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication or you may also update or delete your registration profile. (See “Access/Removal of Your Personal Information”, below.) 
  * Promotions — If you choose to participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests and promotions we may also collect your Personal Information to administer your entry. We may also use Personal Information from you to contact you regarding the selection of prizewinners and to award prizes. 
  * “Daily Dose” Subscription Service — When you subscribe to Daily Dose we will collect Personal Information from you to administer the Service, confirm your subscription and deliver you the content you have requested. We may also ask for your cellular phone carrier. This Service is governed by the [ Daily Dose Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630011157id_/http%3A//www.limelife.com/daily_dose_terms.php). 
We also collect information that cannot be used to identify you personally that you provide as part of registration and your entry into all sweepstakes, contests or promotions (e.g., without limitation, gender and zip code) ( **“Aggregate Demographic Information”** ). We combine your Personal Information with the Aggregate Demographic Information to provide you with a better experience and improve the quality and value of the Services. 


##  Traffic Data 

When you use the Site, our system automatically gathers information about the nature of your usage of our service. This type of data may include: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer or handheld device; (iv) type of web browser; and (v) telecommunications carrier ( **“Traffic Data”** ). Traffic Data is anonymous and you will not be personally identified from this information.

##  Cookies and Action Tags 

Like many websites LimeLife may use cookies on the Site. A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people’s names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to “remember“ things about the user’s visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. LimeLife may also use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may also use cookies and action tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) to collect anonymous information about your visits to our website and other websites in order to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads. They do not collect Personal Information.

##  Information Sharing and Disclosure 

LimeLife may engage a trusted third party to perform functions on our behalf (such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail communications, analyzing data, and providing customer service). These third parties may have access to Traffic Data and Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.

If a promotion, sweepstakes or contest has an outside sponsor, some of your Personal Information may be shared with the sponsor. When necessary to deliver a prize, delivery information about the winner of a promotion, sweepstakes or contest may be shared with a third party.

LimeLife may share your Personal Information you provide with LimeLife subsidiaries and related companies. In addition, LimeLife may disclose Personally information (i) when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (ii) to verify or enforce compliance with the Terms of Use and applicable laws; (iii) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, or (iv) to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change.

##  Children's Personal Information 

The Site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ( **“COPPA”** ). LimeLife does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Site. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the Site, LimeLife will not collect, store or use any Personal Information of such user. Further, in the event that LimeLife receives Personal Information that LimeLife discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, LimeLife will promptly delete such Personal Information in a secure manner.

##  Security 

LimeLife takes security very seriously. To prevent unauthorized access and maintain accuracy, LimeLife has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Personal Information under our control.
