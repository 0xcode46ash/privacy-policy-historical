Examples of non-personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, log files, web beacons, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Site, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the Site. We may collect non-personally identifiable information while you use the Site.

**Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** We may use the non-personally identifiable information to generate user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners, and that we may use to enhance your experience using and generally improve the Site. If we provide any such information to others, we will provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information to generate statistics that we may provide to you and to other Users of the Site. We also may provide non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services related to the Site for us.

We may use different types of technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information, including cookies and single-pixel GIFs. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive to identify your computer to our servers. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, we will use cookies to recognize your computer when you visit the Site so that we can provide you with a better experience and improve the quality of the Site. If you wish, you can configure your browser to disable cookies. If you disable cookies, however, it may impair the functionality of the Site, and we encourage you not to disable cookies.

**Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.** Little Passports may use non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of Little Passports' services; for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, by assessing and maintaining security, by increasing ad placements on web sites that are generating more web traffic, by presenting you with information that we think you would be interested in seeing, or by allowing you to log in or access your profile information automatically. We may also use the information to count and recognize returning users.

We may use non-personally identifiable information collected to determine user demographics, interests, and behavior and may market Little Passports products by sharing non-personally identifiable information with potential customers or partners. Little Passports also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for us. We may also utilize service providers to assist us in aggregating customer information. We may then share such aggregated non-personally identifiable information with prospective marketing partners, advertisers and others.

Links to third parties may be displayed on the Site. Links to third-party websites, including third-party advertisers, may be displayed on the Site. If you choose to click on a third-party link, we may provide non-personally identifiable information to the owning third-party. Also, any such third-party may use cookies or other technologies to collect information when you are visiting their web sites. The information third parties collect is governed by their individual privacy policies. Little Passports does not take responsibility nor can guarantee the content of such third-party privacy policies. In addition, Little Passports may use third-party advertising companies to display advertisements on the Site. These companies may leverage information about your activity on the Site in order to help them provide more relevant ads to you.

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).** PII is any piece of information that can be traced back to a specific individual user and so might be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual. When you use various services or features on the Site, we may ask you to provide PII. For example, if you choose to register at the Site, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, password and/or username, and if you choose to use other services on the Site, you may be asked to provide additional information, such as your street and/or mailing address, gender, credit card, name, telephone number, and age ("User Information"). 

Use of Personally Identifiable Information. Little Passports will not knowingly share PII with third parties except as set forth in our Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use. We may share information with future successors and/or assigns. We may also share PII with third parties who provide Little Passports with administrative services, such as, but not limited to, authorization of credit card and check transactions, order fulfillment, contest administration and fulfillment, and co-branded or joint product and service promotions. We may also share your information with service providers who warehouse product, personalize product and perform order fulfillment services. These service providers are granted access to some or all of your personal information only as is and to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us. Such service providers may use cookies on our behalf in order to perform services for us. If any PII is knowingly provided by Little Passports to such service providers, all such PII will be so provided only under a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the privacy provisions contained in this Privacy Policy. Moreover, we may release information, with or without notice to you, when necessary to comply with the law or a court order or an investigation. We also may release information to law enforcement to protect our rights, property, or other interests, including those of our users or to prevent illegal activities or violations of our Terms of Use.

Little Passports reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users. By providing Little Passports with your email address you consent to our using such email address to send you notices in lieu of postal mail.

If you or we have provided any third party with your information, you will have to contact such third-party directly with any opt-out request.  


### CHILD PROTECTION

IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, Little Passports requires a parent's or guardian's permission before we will collect your personal information. Registration on the site does not currently require you to provide any PII to the website, and so we may accept your registration on the website without your parent or guardian’s prior consent. Even so, your parent or guardian may request that your account be removed from our system at any time. Little Passports may not and will not require a child to disclose any more information than is necessary for such child’s participation in the activity that requires such information.

### NOTE TO PARENTS

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide our visitors with information about our website, which we hope will promote informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protect our users' privacy.

Little Passports recognizes that some younger visitors may not understand some of the information contained on our website or how the site operates. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to provide.

Before collecting personal information from your child, we will send you an email to get your consent to our collection of such information. We make every attempt to inform your children of this policy wherever this information is collected on the Website. However, please note that we do not have the internal mechanisms to confirm the accuracy of the statements they provide to us. We will never require a child to disclose any more information than is necessary to register and use the Site or the activity for which your child is registering.

Currently, registration on the Site does not require your child to provide any PII to the website, and so we may accept your child’s registration on the website without your prior consent. Nonetheless, you may request that your child’s account be removed from our system at any time. Before we collect PII from a child under the age of 13, we will send an email to such user’s parents or guardian requesting their consent to our collection of PII from their child. Parents and guardians will be given [48] hours to refuse such consent. If the parent or guardian refuses to provide their consent, we will delete that child's information from our database. If you do not respond within the requested time period, we will send a second follow-up email requesting your permission for your child to use the site. We will not collect any additional information from your child without your consent.

We will maintain your child’s user account in accordance with this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and any applicable laws at all times. Please read our Terms of Service for more information on the content and materials that Little Passports allows to be posted on our websites.

If your child’s information is deleted from our system and your child subsequently wishes to re-register on the system, your child will have to submit his or her information and you will have to give your consent pursuant to the procedures set forth above.

You have the right to review your child’s personal information, to have it deleted from the Website, and to limit further collection and use of your child’s personal information. To do any of the above, please send us an email at [customerservice@littlepassports.com](mailto:customerservice@littlepassports.com) that details your request, and we will be happy to comply. Before disclosing child-specific information, we may verify your identity through means such as the following: obtaining a signed form from you via postal mail or fax, receiving an email from you accompanied by your digital signature, or receiving an email from you combined with a unique identifier such as a password. If you suspect that your child has offered personal information in error and/or you wish us to remove their information from our database, we are happy to do so. Please contact us at [customerservice@littlepassports.com](mailto:customerservice@littlepassports.com) or at the mailing address below and be sure to include the following:   
your child's name and email address   
your name and email address   
the name of Little Passports   


Little Passports, Inc.  
222 Sutter Street, Suite 750  
San Francisco, CA 94108  


### Security

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Be aware, however, that the Internet is not 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. We cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet, and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of such information. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. You also acknowledge that many portions of the Site are password protected. Do not share your passwords with anyone. You are solely responsible for any actions taken on the Site under your account.

### Compromise of Personal Information

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
