## Use of Information Obtained by Lithium

### Information Users Submit to Lithium

Information collected by Lithium from each Client Community is used solely to provide the Services for that Community, to provide related Services to the Client who manages that Community, and as otherwise agreed in a contract between Lithium and the Client. Other information gathered is solely used to: (i) respond to a user's request for additional information on Lithium Services; (ii) provide, develop, enhance and support related Lithium Services; (iii) fulfill Lithium’s legal obligations and defend Lithium’s legal rights, as needed. We may also use a user's email address to send promotional or marketing materials on related Services, such as updates on the Lithium product line, but this is only after the user is a Client, Service is requested by the user, or Lithium has some other pre-existing business relationship with the user. We use your IP address and browser-type information in the general administration of our website. 

In addition, we use the information that we gather from other social media sites to: 

a) provide context to a brand, such as information about an individual’s past interactions with that brand, and the individual’s public profile information, to improve the quality of the brand’s interactions with that consumer who is reaching out to them over social media,

b) assess each individual’s general topics of interest (but excluding sensitive topics such as political or religious views),

c) measure their influence on social media by assigning a numerical value based on our proprietary algorithm which looks at frequency/ dates of activity, responses of other individuals to that activity, and the occurrence of certain key words and/or brand names, and,

d) allow brands to compare themselves to other brands in their industry by seeing aggregated statistics of the numbers of individuals who promote or detract from each brand based on the individuals’ public social media activity.

Through our Lithium Social Media Management platform, we provide this information on individuals to the customer support and service representatives of the companies who are Lithium customers, the “brands”, so that those representatives can provide support and service to their consumer customers more effectively, by triaging communications to address more urgent requests in priority order, and by understanding the interests of their consumer customers to provide more targeted support. We also provide aggregated statistic to the brands for competitive analysis purposes. 

Through our Lithium Community and Lithium JX Community platforms, we make social impact scores available for individuals who participate in the community to create more effective and interesting social interactions within the Community. 

In the collection and use of information from other social media sites, we rely on our legitimate interests in providing services to our customers, and assisting them to provide better service to their customers, under applicable data privacy regulations, and balance those interests with the data privacy concerns of individuals. If you would like more information about our legitimate interests analysis, or have concerns that you would like us to address, please contact [privacy@lithium.com](mailto:privacy@lithium.com). 

In regards to Lithium Services, Lithium collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.
