## Changes in Our Privacy Notice

This Privacy notice may change from time to time, so please review it frequently for any updates or changes. If we make material changes to this notice we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or we will place a prominent notice on our web site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

### Access to Your Personally Identifying Information (pii)

Lithium acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Upon request Lithium will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information collected via this Site. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information collected via this Site by emailing us at _privacy@lithium.com_. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. 

We are unable to delete information accessed or provided through the Services if we do not control such information, such as information that originated through a social media network and is consequently controlled by such social media network, except to the extent that a copy of that data exists on our systems and with the permission of the data controller. 

In regards to Lithium Services, Lithium has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Lithium’s customer (the data controller) in regards to Lithium Services. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. 

### Security of Your Personally Identifying Information

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifying information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Please keep in mind, however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or any method of electronic storage is perfectly secure. If you have any questions about our security practices or security on our website, you can visit our security information page at [_lithium.com/security_](http://www.lithium.com/security) or email us at _privacy@lithium.com_

### Choices and Opt-out Options

Users have the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their personally identifying information used for certain purposes such as receiving promotional or other marketing material from us during the registration process for downloading a whitepaper or signing up for our webcasts. Additionally, users who no longer wish to receive our updates or newsletters may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the mailer or by emailing us at marketing@lithium.com. Please include the term “OPT-OUT” in the subject line immediately followed by your email address. 

### Data Retention

We will retain your contact information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide your Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide services, contact us at _marketing@lithium.com_. Please include the term “OPT-OUT” in the subject line immediately followed by your email address. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### US-EU Privacy Shield, US-Swiss Privacy Shield, & EC Standard Contractual Clauses

In the course of performing its Services, Lithium and its subprocessors may access and/or transfer personal data to (or from) areas outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), pursuant to either, at Lithium’s sole option: (i) the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses (“Clauses”) or (ii) the EU-US Privacy Shield program and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield program (collectively “Privacy Shield”). 

The following Lithium products are Privacy Shield certified, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland: Conversations, Intelligence, Experiences, and Vault (collectively, the “Privacy Shield Certified Products”). For the Privacy Shield Certified Products, we have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield programs, please visit [__](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)_<https://www.privacyshield.gov/>_.

For the Privacy Shield Certified Products, we will adhere to the requirements of the Privacy Shield with respect to personal information (as defined below). As a condition to using the Services, customers are required to obtain all necessary individual consents in order to collect and use personal information. 

For purposes of this Privacy Shield disclosure, “personal information” means data that is (a) transferred from the European Union or Switzerland, as the case may be, to the United States; (b) recorded in any form; and (c) about, or pertains to, a specific individual who is identified in, or is identifiable from, the data. “Sensitive information” means personal information specifying medical or health conditions, personal sexuality, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, ideological, philosophical, or trade union-related beliefs, views or activities, trade union membership, information specifying the sex life of the individual, information on social security measures, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions, which are treated outside pending proceedings. Sensitive information also includes personal information received from a third party where the third party treats and identifies it as sensitive. 

Lithium strictly prohibits the entry of Sensitive Information into Lithium systems, except with the express prior written consent of Lithium in each instance.

If Lithium relies on Privacy Shield as a basis for transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and if Privacy Shield is deemed invalid by a competent authority or otherwise superseded, then any such transfers of EEA personal data outside the EEA shall be conducted pursuant to the EC Standard Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses”) and Lithium will execute a copy of the Clauses at customer’s request. 

### Enforcement

Lithium is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”). In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield, Lithium is potentially liable.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield, Lithium commits to resolve complaints about privacy and our collection or use of personal information. European Union and Switzerland citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Notice should first send us an email to _legal@lithium.com_. 

Lithium has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield principles, to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (the “ICDR”), an international dispute resolution provider. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [__](http://www.icdr.org/)_[www.icdr.org](http://www.icdr.org/)_ for more information and to file a complaint. 

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
