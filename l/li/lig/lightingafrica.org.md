**I.                     Information collection and use   
**In connection with the use of the Site and the Services, we collect certain personal and non-personal information from you.  We use this information to fulfill your requests; improve and manage the Site and the Services; personalize your experience on the Site; contact you; offer you products and services that may be of interest to you; if you so elect, to permit other registered users of the Site to contact you as discussed in Article VI below; and in connection with the various features of the Site that may permit you to input, post or provide information.  We collect personal and non-personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us (for example, in the course of registration) and when you visit the Site.  The information we collect from you depends on your use of the Site.

Depending on how you use the Site, we may collect certain personal and non-personal information from you in the following ways:

**Registration:**   There are many aspects of the Site that can be enjoyed as a visitor, but you need to register in order to utilize certain features and access certain content in the Site and to take advantage of many of the Services on the Site.  Registration is entirely optional. In the course of registration, you are required to provide us with certain personal information such as your e-mail address.   The information required to be provided in connection with registration, such as your name, is not made available to other users of the Site, unless you elect to do so.

**Business Information:**   Registered users of the Site may elect to also fill out an extended profile with business information to help us customize features for you.  You may also opt to publish this business information in the Member Directory on the Site so other users can find you.  Filling out the business information form and publishing in the Member Directory are entirely optional.  If published on the Site, this information will be displayed to other users of the Site and other related country-specific websites.  Registered users may also elect to create a personalized web page for their business.

In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.
