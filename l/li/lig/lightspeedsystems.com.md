# Privacy Policy – Lightspeed Systems

### Privacy Policy

This site is owned and operated by Lightspeed Systems Inc. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Lightspeed Systems, we want to make your online experience satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

In brief, Lightspeed Systems:

  * Gives users a choice to "opt in" for services.
  * Offers "opt-out" options in its communications.
  * Collects personal information only by voluntary means.
  * Includes a verification procedure, such as an email confirmation, whenever possible.
  * Uses provided information only to serve our customers.
  * Does not share information with third parties other than Lightspeed Systems service partners unless the user expressly agrees.
  * Provides an easy way for customers to contact us and resolve problems promptly.
  * Protects customer information with appropriate security technology.
  * Does not probe for exploitable vulnerabilities of your network.
  * Does not knowingly solicit information from children under 13 years of age.



**INFORMATION LIGHTSPEED SYSTEMS GATHERS AND TRACKS**

Lightspeed Systems gathers information about websites and information about users of Lightspeed’s websites.

We gather information about web sites because our software solutions include an integrated Internet Content Database, which is used to help manage student and employee access to Internet resources. The entries within this database are divided into distinguishing categories which help network administrators comply with Federal and State laws and community/school district standards for "appropriate" Internet access.

To provide and maintain this database, it is imperative that we minutely examine, accurately evaluate and consistently categorize the content and nature of any and all websites that may be accessed by the students and staff of those institutions. Our methodologies for building and maintaining this public database of categorized entities (domains, businesses, free and fee services, informational websites, etc.) includes a thorough, automated and systematic review of ALL available public-content domains, including webservers, webpages, content files and linked websites addressed within those domains. We do not attempt to access and examine the content of secured addresses, and simply categorize the parent domain based upon the available ‘public’ content.

Though this process performs intense examination of internet entities, we are not probing for, nor are we interested in, exploitable vulnerabilities of a network. We are merely determining the nature of the domain/organization as it is presented through publicly accessible content, and categorizing it accordingly.

If you are interested in the detailed results of our categorization efforts as related to particular network domains, webservers and websites, we invite you to query our archive of categorized URLs at [http://archive.lightspeedsystems.com](http://archive.lightspeedsystems.com/).

The balance of this privacy policy discusses the two types of information Lightspeed Systems gathers about users of its sites.

  1. Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to: receive our electronic newsletters and RSS news feeds; participate in our support wiki, message boards or forums; request support, trial versions of software, price quotes, and other product information; email a friend, and participate in polls and surveys.
  2. Information Lightspeed Systems gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs. **Under no circumstances does Lightspeed Systems divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.**



**Optional Voluntary Information**

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

  1. **Electronic newsletters policy**  
We offer free electronic newsletters/messages to users about best practices, usage tips, product upgrades, product updates, new products, and services, and to provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you. Lightspeed Systems gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter. 
  2. **Lightspeed Wiki policy**  
Users of Lightspeed Systems’ free wiki site must register separately for these services in order to leave comments, create pages, create RSS feeds, view product roadmaps and make suggestions--although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a name, organization, username, password, and email address. 
  3. **Product registration**  
Lightspeed Systems products ask you for certain personally identifiable information as part of the installation/registration process (including but not limited to your name, organization, email address, credit card information, connection type and number of computers). This information is necessary in order to conclude the transaction, and for applicable products, to be eligible to receive technical support. 
  4. **Technical Support**  
If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as your name, organization, email address and information about your computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. In the course of providing support, your data may be transmitted to service providers that are under contract to Lightspeed Systems and have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure. 
  5. **Polling**  
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Lightspeed Systems may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 
  6. **Surveys**  
Lightspeed Systems may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content and product development to our audience. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 
  7. **Partner Application**  
If you request participation in the partner program online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction such as company name, contact names, email addresses, and company profile. 



**Usage tracking**

Lightspeed Systems tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of its sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Lightspeed Systems does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

Lightspeed Systems tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use such information to determine whether we’re providing the sorts of information users expect to find. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall and whether the site is meeting expectations. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Lightspeed Systems uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to actively participate in various interactive aspects of our sites.

**USE OF INFORMATION**

Lightspeed Systems uses any information voluntarily given by our users to effectively respond to inquiries, and to enhance users’ experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and product information and to enable users to participate in the Lightspeed Wiki. Lightspeed Systems never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties.

Also, in the course of supporting your Lightspeed Systems product, your data may be transmitted to service providers that are under contract to Lightspeed Systems and have agreed to abide by the provisions of this privacy policy. Such transmissions of your data are encrypted and secure.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.

**SHARING OF THE INFORMATION**

Lightspeed Systems and its service partners will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

**SECURITY**

Lightspeed Systems operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password-protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

**OPT-OUT POLICY**

We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * **Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.**
  * **Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.**



**YOUR CONSENT**

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Lightspeed Systems. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
