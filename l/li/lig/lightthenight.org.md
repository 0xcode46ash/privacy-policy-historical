# Privacy Policy - Light The Night

**Scope  
**This statement applies to all websites operated by or on behalf of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS).

**BBB OnLine Privacy Program  
**Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau’s BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program’s strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at www.bbbonline.org

All BBBOnLine Privacy Program participants are required to work with the program's dispute resolution process. The Privacy Program will only accept complaints regarding the misuse of personally identifiable information by a website operator. For more information about the Privacy Program dispute resolution process visit [www.bbbonline.org/privacy/dr.asp](http://www.bbbonline.org/privacy/dr.asp)

**Registration**  
Registration can be made to the Society Web sites through barkers on the sites, and through the registration page available on the main Society Web site ([www.leukemia-lymphoma.org](http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/)). It is not necessary to register or submit any personal information in order to use the Society Web sites. All sections of the Society Web sites are available and fully functional for users who do not chose to register, or who register but do not log into the Society sites when visiting them. The Society does however provide a range of Web site personalization options, for which a user must first register including personal fundraising pages for selected events through a 3rd party vendor.

Any and all user information provided to the Society Web sites through our personalization/registration tools can be viewed, edited, or deleted by that user at any time..

**Information Use  
**The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society collects information from users through several points on the Web site such as registration to the site, making a donation, order free informational materials, and signing up to post on the Society bulletin boards and online event fundraising. The primary reason for The Society to collect personal users' information is to facilitate the Society's Web site personalization options for them, and to facilitate Web site features that require user input, whether this information is submitted directly by the site user, or collected by use of technologies such as cookies, as discussed below.

Personal financial information in the form of a credit card number and expiration date are only collected if a site user wishes to make an online donation through the Society Web sites. This information is not maintained by the Society when entered online. All online transactions are securely transmitted using SSL encryption.

User information submitted through the Society Web sites is only used for the purposes for which it was collected.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about that user. The Society uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

The primary function of cookies for the Society is to facilitate use of our Web sites by our users, and to enrich your online experience with us.

Persistent cookies are used to store the user's registration identification information from their basic registration, to facilitate their logging in to their personalized view of the Society Web sites. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our sites. See the Profile section.

Session cookies remember what chapter you are registered into or visiting online and who you are if you go from one Society Web site to another in a session. This way you do not have to separately log into the various Society Web sites as you go from one to another of them during that session.

If users reject cookies, they may still use our sites, and all the informational resources provided through them. Their registration-based personalization options and the capacity of their browser to keep track of what chapter they are visiting online as they go from one of our sites to another, is lost if the user rejects cookies.

The Society uses a tracking utility provided by a 3rd party vendor to track usage of specific web pages and other resources provided through our web site. The vendor sets cookies as a method for compiling site usage information but these cookies are only used to compile demographic models of site usage and are not tied to the user's personal information.

**Referral Service  
**The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society provides options for site visitors to send messages to friends including the option to send ePostcards, pages or eNewsletters or to notify a friend of a donation. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. The Society stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society at [admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org](mailto:admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org) to request the removal of this information from our database. Data obtained through the "Notify a Friend of a Donation" feature is only used for notification purposes.

**Communications from the Site**

**New Registration Emails  
**All newly registered users may automatically sent a welcoming email containing useful information orienting the user to Society Web site services. This email may also include the email address login and the password that the user registered with, as a reminder to help the user access their new registration and their personalized view of the Society Web sites. In some cases, the email is sent from a partner site that is providing additional services such as personal online fundraising pages.

**Newsletter  
**If a user wishes to opt-in subscribe to our e-newsletter, we ask for contact information required for basic registration to the site, consisting of a working email address, a zip code and a password.

**Sharing**

**Legal Disclaimer  
**Though the Society makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

The Society does not share personally identifiable information with third parties except as required as above by law.

**Third Party Intermediaries**

  * The Society uses various 3rd party transaction services to process online donations.

  * The Society provides the option of receiving certain of its online booklets, brochures, and fact sheets by mail through request forms on our Web sites. These materials are shipped by the US Postal Service.

  * Additional services for Light The Night Incentives, ordering from the Society e-store also utilize 3rd party vendors for ordering, fulfillment and customer service.




These companies/organizations do not share or use personally identifiable information that may be obtained from these transactions for any secondary purposes.

**Links**

The Society Web site provides select links to other sites. Determination of which outside links to include on the Society Web sites is made by healthcare and clinical research professionals, to ensure that only links to sites that meet our standards for accuracy and reliability are included. Please be aware, however, that the Society is not responsible for the policies or privacy practices of Web sites maintained by other organizations. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites, and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information that they might visit. This Society privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Society Web sites.

**Notification of Changes  
**If the Society changes its privacy policy, changes to this privacy statement will be posted, with prominent links to the new policy positioned on the Society homepage ([http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org](http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/)), and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. The Society will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy  
**Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13.

**If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact us by email at [admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org](mailto:admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org) or by postal mail at:
