**Children**

The Line Rider Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from children under 13 years of age beyond an e-mail address used only once for verification purposes. While children under the age of 13 can create/save tracks, and view Line Rider movies, they are not permitted to post in the forums. Line Rider movies are not stored directly on our servers, but are linked to third party video sharing sites such as YouTube. We strongly encourage parents to review the Privacy Policies and Terms of Use of these sites before allowing your children to view them. While we do our best to ensure that only Line Rider videos are posted in our Movies page, we do not take responsibility for what our users link to. In the event that we find inappropriate or non-Line Rider related content it will be promptly removed.

We ask for an email address during the registration process to guard against malicious computer programs which may try to sign up automatically. The email is deleted from our records immediately following the verification process. We will not use the email address to contact you or share with any third parties.

Line Rider may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by inXile Entertainment Inc.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with inXile Entertainment under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help inXile Entertainment communicate with you about offers from Line Rider and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of inXile Entertainment 's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

We transfer information about you if inXile Entertainment is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, inXile Entertainment will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

Line Rider displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement. 

Line Rider advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

**Third Party Advertising**

Advertisements that appear on Line Rider are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. inXile Entertainment does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Line Rider unless you choose to share it with them.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by inXile Entertainment and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

**Changing or Removing Information**

Access and control over most personal information on Line Rider is readily available through the profile editing tools. Line Rider users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Line Rider account may do so by contacting us via email at [info@linerider.com](mailto:info@linerider.com)  . Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Line Rider.

Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Line Rider, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Line Rider user) you generally cannot remove such communications.
