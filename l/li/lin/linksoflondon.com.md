**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small file stored on your computer by a web site to give you a unique ID. Cookies help make it easier and faster for you to use our site because it can remember if you've visited the site, and they help us provide you with the information you need about your gift reminders or account details - when and where you need it.   
A cookie generated by our site contains no information about you. It contains only a numeric ID that, for example, allows you to retrieve your account details or shopping list. The cookie lets you enter your email and password so you don't have to enter those details again, or it lets you save products to a wish list if available.   
In keeping with our privacy policy on customer information, we analyse data gathered via cookies only in aggregate, not at the individual customer level.
