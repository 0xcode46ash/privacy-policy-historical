# Privacy Policy | Links of London

**Data Security**

  
 **How will you protect my data online?**

Your privacy as an individual and as a customer is important to us, so we don't use the information you provide on this site to learn any more about you other than what is required to fulfil your orders or offer you services such as new alerts or reminder services. Any personal data gathered by us in your use of this site will be recorded electronically and only used in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. When data is gathered and stored by Links of London in the USA, it may be transmitted between the USA and the UK in order to affect delivery of your goods and provide our full customer service to you, as well as to compile accounting and other records.

 **How do you protect the information you hold about me on your internal systems?**

We protect your privacy in several ways:  
Access to customer account information is limited to those who need access for the performance of their job.  
We use full login and password controls on our system.  
All calls are recorded and monitored for training and security purposes.  
Confidentiality and database access controls are reviewed periodically and updated as required to further protect our personal data.

 **Do you use cookies?**

Links of London use cookies in order to create an enjoyable and easy online shopping experience for you.

Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you and are used only to determine your browser and user preferences for our site.

 **Payment Security**

We know that security is a major concern to many of our customers. We have put a very secure system in place so you can feel completely at ease when shopping with us over the Internet.

To securely receive your payments over the Internet we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which is the standard Internet practice and means your details are protected. You can see that you are in a secure environment through the 'padlock' symbol on Microsoft Internet Explorer or 'key' symbol on Netscape Navigator. SSL works with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 and later versions/ Netscape Browser versions 2.0 and later versions. We feel it's important to have this level of security available, so anyone using lower version browsers should contact us by phone to place an order. 

Please don't try to send orders via email, as we cannot guarantee any secure transmission of details. We will take all reasonable care to keep your order secure, but in the absence of our sole negligence we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party obtains unauthorised access to any data (including credit and account details) you provide when accessing or ordering from the site.  If you're still worried about security over the Internet, then please contact us by phone.

 **Our Mailing List**

Links of London uses your email address as a convenient way to contact you about your order or any reminder service you have. From time to time, we may update you on relevant Links of London site or new gift news, but only with your permission. We will not pass your details on to any other relevant third parties that we think you may be interested in if you have requested us not to do this.

  
 **Can I be removed from your mailing list?**

Links of London will send you special offers and promotions by email. If you do not want to receive offers and promotions by email, simply click on the unsubscribe link in any email. 

  
 **Why did I receive your brochure when I didn't request it?**

We will never add your email to our mailing list without your consent. We may have received your details from a third party company with which collaborated with but we will always include a clear opt in feature to our mailing list.

  
 **Will you pass my data on to third parties?**

Links of London will never pass on your email address to a third party for marketing purposes.  
We respect your privacy and are committed to protect it.
