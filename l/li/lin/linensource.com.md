**How do we safeguard your information?**

Protecting the safety of your personal information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. When you enter your personal information on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. As an additional security check, you may want to look at the URL or Location line of your browser to ensure that the first characters of the address changes from ?http? to ?https?. If you are not comfortable shopping online at our websites, please feel free to place your order with us at the number listed on the websites.

_Secure Shopping_   


Where our websites permit you to enter credit card or other billing information, we use industry-standard encryption technologies to encrypt that information while it is being transmitted. In addition, we make commercially acceptable efforts to stay up to date with best practices regarding the protection of information in connection with transactions occurring over the Internet.

_Phone Orders_   


Some versions of popular web browsers and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. If your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our websites. If so, you may place orders by calling us toll-free at 1-800-431-2620.

We follow industry practices to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, but no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet. Also, please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information such as credit card numbers.

* * *

**Links To Other Websites**

Please remember that this Privacy and Security Policy applies only to the linensource not to the other Orchard Brands family of related companies. The other Orchard Brands family of companies have their own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy and Security Policy. In addition, our websites may include links that take you to other websites for outside business partners, vendors and advertisers. These third party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over such websites, and are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or information-gathering practices of other entities or websites.

* * *

**Children's Privacy**

Our websites are not directed towards children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age on our websites. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of 13 on our websites, we will delete the information from our records.

* * *

**California Privacy Rights**

In certain circumstances, California law entitles California residents to request us to provide, free of charge and no more than once per calendar year, a list of the categories of the residents? personal information disclosed by us to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, together with the names and addresses of all such third parties and a description of such third parties' businesses, if not already reasonably apparent from the third parties' names.

**Conflict in Terms**

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read privacy policy with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our privacy policy into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary"; it is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the privacy policy upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our privacy policy. For this reason, you should rely on our privacy policy as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
