# Lincoln Center

Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. ("LCPA") knows that users of its web site care about the personal information they provide to us. This privacy policy, which is part of our overall Terms and Conditions of Use, is designed to provide you with information about how we collect, store and use personally identifiable information obtained through our web site. We refer to this information as "personal information." LCPA reserves the right to revise this privacy policy from time to time.

## How Information Is Collected

When you register for My Lincoln Center or wish to utilize certain of our web site services, we will ask you for information such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, certain demographic information and (if needed) credit card information. As discussed below, we use this information to register you as a unique user, let you access personalized services, and for other purposes.

### Cookies

Like most web sites, our site uses "cookies." A "cookie" is a text file, invoked by standard browser software, that we place on your hard drive to enable our systems to, among other things, recognize your browser, track transactions, and allow you to navigate our web site without having to re-enter information. The information gathered by cookies is not made available to other organizations. We may also automatically receive and store certain other types of information, such as the type of web browser you use or the pages you link to from the LCPA web site.

Certain of our programs, such as My Lincoln Center, use personal information to send updates and notices to registered users via e-mail. If you provide your mailing address or telephone number, LCPA may also use your personal information to contact you by mail or by telephone regarding special offers from LCPA, updated information about LCPA or the LCPA web site, and new services offered by LCPA. If you wish to be removed from this contact list, you may do so by contacting LCPA directly. (See the "Whom To Contact If You Have Questions" section below).

## Sharing Your Data With Third-Parties

LCPA may engage reputable third-party vendors in order to help us manage our web site and allow us to better service our visitors and customers. These may include third-party vendors engaged to analyze, for marketing purposes, the information collected on our web site. We take reasonable efforts to ensure that these parties only use the data to perform the services for us and protect the data at least as much as described in this policy.

We may occasionally make personal information available to select other organizations, including but not limited to, non-profit arts organizations, affiliated organizations, agents working on our behalf, companies or organizations with whom we have a contractual or sponsor relationship, or in connection with an asset transfer. We may also provide aggregated data to these and other organizations. Although we may make reasonable inquiries to determine that such other organizations maintain web site privacy policies comparable to ours, we are not responsible for the enforcement of such policies.

LCPA's site may contain links to third-party web sites. Once you leave LCPA's web site, this privacy policy will not apply to such web sites.

## Administration Of Our Web Site / Compliance With Law

We may disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms and Conditions of Use or to protect the safety, property or other rights of our users or the public. In addition, we may disclose or access account information for administrative and other purposes that we believe are necessary to develop, maintain, and improve our products and services. We also may disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.

## You Can Review And Change Your Personal Information

## Security Used To Protect Your Information

We take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of customer information via a variety of access controls, including password protection, electronic firewalls, and data encryption. However, no mode of transmission or method of storage can be completely secure, so LCPA cannot guarantee the security of such information.
