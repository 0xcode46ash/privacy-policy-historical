### Linksys Privacy Policy

We at Linksys are committed to honoring your privacy and we want you to know how we protect your information (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, email, and telephone number). That is why Linksys has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information.  
We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. Our Four Pillars of Privacy demonstrate that commitment: 

  1. We do not use any information about where you personally go on our site or on the Web, and we do not give it out to others.
  2. We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names. 
  3. We may use information about the kinds of products you buy to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out your individual purchase information to others.
  4. We restrict employee access to customer information in order to safeguard your personal information.

  
**What information does Linksys receive and how does Linksys use it?**  
In general, you can visit www.linksys.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the products people buy and the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us to learn how our customers as a group purchase our products and use our Web site. We use this information in the aggregate so that we can improve the products and services Linksys provides you. We may also share this statistical information with our partners and other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information.  
**May I choose the information I disclose?**  
While we need certain information to register you as a unique customer and let you access Linksys support services, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion.  
**May I choose the communications I receive?**  
We will occasionally send out an email newsletter to Linksys customers to highlight savings opportunities, new products, and new technologies. You can elect not to receive communications from us, either when you register or by noting your preference in response to communications from us.  
**What kind of security is used to protect my information?**  
We store all customer information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. The data is accessed only for the purposes stated in this privacy statement.  
**Who has access to my information?**  
Linksys does not share personally identifiable information with other companies (apart from those acting as our agents in providing our services to you, who agree to use if only for that purpose).  
**Does Linksys place cookies on my computer?**  
No, in most cases Linksys does not use cookies, which are small bits of data stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. The Linksys Online RMA system does use cookies however.  
**What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?**  
We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.  
**What about other companies affiliated with Linksys?**  
You may separately agree to provide your information to other companies who provide content and/or promotions for various parts of our services in order to use their services, order their products, or receive offers form them. If you agree to provide information to these companies, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.  
**Who can I contact if I have any questions regarding my privacy?**  
Personal data privacy is a new and evolving area, and Linksys is evolving to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible, and miscommunication is possible. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us directly at [privacy@linksys.com](mailto:privacy@linksys.com). As we honor your privacy, we will respond to your inquiries in a prompt and professional manner. **Thank you for your support of Linksys and its policies.**
