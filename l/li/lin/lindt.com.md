**_Use of cookies, web beacons and Google Analytics_**

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. 

We also use "web beacons" to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies or similar technologies from third party service providers. 

Our Sites may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Sites and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other websites you used prior to coming to the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the 

_[Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html "Google Analytics Terms of Service")_

Google may use the data collected on the Sites to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Sites, please review

**_How do you keep Personal Information secure?_**

Lindt takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect information transmitted via our Sites. Our Sites are scanned regularly for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your use of our Sites as safe as possible. 

Nevertheless, because no Sites are impenetrable, we cannot guarantee that information that users of the Sites may transmit or otherwise supply will be totally secure. 

**_How long do you keep Personal Information?_**

We hold onto different types of data as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you requested, or for another legitimate purpose such as complying with legal obligations. Because the needs vary based on different data types, retention periods may vary significantly. 

For example, we may keep information about you and how you use our Sites as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm as described in the **_How We Use Information_** section. 

**_Links to third party websites_**

For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on our Sites that link to other websites not under our control. We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Notice does not apply to, the privacy practices of those sites or of any companies that we do not own or control.
