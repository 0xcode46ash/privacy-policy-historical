LinuxLinks.com's Statement of Privacy

Our policy respects and protects the privacy of our visitors. We have a strict policy never to disclose information about our visitors to external organisations unless we have written permission to do so. 

Information that is provided to advertisers consists of aggregate statistics that we collate. This includes geographical and psychographic information. 

When links are submitted to our site, we request that the sender provides us with their real name and email address. These specific details are never passed to external companies. In addition, LinuxLinks.com itself respects the information provided and undertakes only to contact the sender if there is a specific need. 

Links to Other Sites

The links database largely consists of pointers to external sites which we have no control over. These include the banner advertisements that are run on the site, together with text links found in our Category pages. The external sites may collate information about you with the use of 'cookies'. 

While LinuxLinks.com strives to protect its users personal information, we do not guarantee that information disclosed online is not distributed by these external companies. Visitors provide information at their own risk.
