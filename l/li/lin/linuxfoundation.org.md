# Privacy Policy - The Linux Foundation

### From The Linux Foundation

Our organization is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We provide certain services and opportunities for users of our website. 

In order to provide these services to you and to develop a better site, we require that you submit some of your personal information. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. 

When you register to receive information or complete an information form, we collect information from you. This information is necessary in order to tailor our subsequent communications to you, fulfill your requests regarding information and projects, and to contact you about our developments and activities. 

We will not sell, rent, or share your personally identifiable information with others, unless we have your permission or are required by law. We will not share aggregate data with our sponsors, members or other parties. 

A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

We may use cookies to identify what pages are being used and which ones aren't. This helps us analyze the webpage traffic and improve our site. We may allow other companies that are present on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Other companies do not have access to our cookies. 

We want to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. If you are uncomfortable with cookie technology, you may adjust your web browser accordingly. 

We may amend this policy occasionally. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you. 

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our use of personal information on this site, please contact us at [info@linux-foundation.org](mailto:info@linux-foundation.org "mailto:info@linux-foundation.org").
