### Information collection

_Registration_

Your name and email address are collected at registration. Special Memberships which give users annual access to features and tools of the LINKME service may be offered in the future and in this case credit card information may also be collected at the time of registration. 

_Profile information_

Profile information is compiled by submitting your CV. No other data or time commitment is required unless you do not have a CV and then some effort is required in order to manually submit your skills and experience 

_Information about your contacts and other third parties_

In order to invite others to connect with you directly via the LINKME Website, you can enter their names and email addresses. Before sending an invitation, you must ensure that the account holder for each email address you enter agrees that you can give the address to us and that we can send them your invitation including a message composed by you. LINKME will not use this information until they provide their information personally to LINKME other than as a means for you to manage your contacts. If you otherwise provide any personal information about other individuals to LINKME (e.g. in your CV), you must tell those individuals why you are providing their personal information to LINKME and that they can contact us for further information (see 'Questions or Comments' below). You must not provide us with information about anyone who objects to you providing it. 

_Cookies & log files_

The LINKME Website uses cookies to track sessions. Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser provide a more seamless browsing experience. Cookies may also be used to record non-personal information such as the date, time or duration of your visit, or the pages accessed, for website administration, statistical and maintenance purposes. Any such information will be aggregated and not linked to particular individuals. The default settings of browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer always allow cookies, but users can easily erase cookies from their hard-drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note that some parts of the LINKME Website may not function fully for users that disallow cookies. 

### Information use

The LINKME service is provided to assist users to network with other users in order to make contacts to assist them in their professional development. The service is also designed to reduce the time and effort it takes to find new employment opportunities by allowing those users, who nominate that they wish to participate, to have their details, skills and experience searchable by applicable employers and recruiters. 

LINKME may communicate with users via email. LINKME users may also communicate with other users via email. LINKME from time to time may ask users to update their profile / CV information by submitting updated information or CV's. LINKME may also send news to users about new features and updates to the LINKME service. LINKME complies with the 

Spam Act and allows users to unsubscribe from receiving commercial electronic messages from LINKME. 

LINKME may not be able to do the things described in this section without your personal information. For example, we may not be able to contact you or facilitate your connection with other users.

### Information sharing

_Third party searching_

LINKME values user choice and therefore allows users to change their preferences about sharing information with third parties for the purpose of employment opportunities. 

Networker to Networker interaction is anonymous until users choose to reveal their details to each other. Only anonymous excerpts of user information are shown to networkers for the purpose of validating searches on specific user attributes. 

Note: Users will always know the identity of those users whom they invited in the first instance - They had to know them to invite them. 

_Partnering_

LINKME may partner with other service providers in order to evolve or expand the LINKME service offering and these services will only be marketed to users via the web site or email if nominated by the user. 

_Communications between users_

Many emails you initiate through LINKME, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your name in the subject line of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you are directly connected. 

Other communications that you initiate through the LINKME website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if you choose to disclose that information. 

Other sharing and use

LINKME may also use and share information:

  * with LINKME’s related bodies corporate;
  * with LINKME's suppliers on condition that they only use it for the purpose of providing services (such as information technology, legal or accounting services) to LINKME;
  * in connection with an acquisition or potential acquisition of an interest in LINKME;
  * to the extent that we are required or authorised by law to do so; and
  * for administrative purposes including research, planning, service development, security and risk management.
