**Data Security**

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In an effort to protect your personal information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with 256 bit encryption. If your browser supports SSL (most current browsers do), it will automatically encrypt the information you provide to us on the secure pages on our site, before sending it over the Internet.

When visiting a page on our site that includes any of your personal information, the bottom of your browser window will display, an icon of a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending upon your browser). This indicates that you have successfully connected with our secure server.

To authenticate the security of your connection before submitting any of your personal information, you can double click on the icon to display our digital certificate.

Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, we suggest that you contact us by phone, or fax your order to us.

**Data Collection**

When you choose to place an order with us, you are invited to log in, so that we can identify who you are. As a newcomer, it will be suggested that you register for future identification. The registration page asks you to enter your name, a user ID, a password, and your e-mail address. You can update this information at any time by clicking on the "my account" link at the top of every page and selecting "Account Information." to update in the next page.

When you decide to place an order, you are asked to complete an order form. The order form requires your name, billing and shipping address etc. You should also include other information fields such as your telephone number, to allow us to contact you regarding your order if necessary. This information is collected to make your shopping experience with us as smooth and pleasant as possible. It is used only for the benefit of Linkdelight and you, our customer.
