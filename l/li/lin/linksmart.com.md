# Linksmart's Legal and Privacy Policy

LinkSmart, Inc. (“LinkSmart”) is a technology company offering software products and services to the web publishing industry. We help publishers of web content analyze and optimize reader traffic and engagement through contextual hyperlinking. We provide this privacy policy so we may inform you about how our technology (“Technology”) processes information on behalf of the website owners that use our services (our “Clients”). This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website (“Website”), www.linksmart.com. If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@linksmart.com](mailto:privacy@linksmart.com).

### COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITES

#### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

The Website is directed to our Clients and prospective Clients, who are the owners and proprietors of websites. The Website is not directed to consumers. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via the Website. PII is information that may be used to identify a particular person or entity, and includes, by way of example, name, business name, email address and website URL. Generally speaking, we only collect PII on the Website when you choose to provide it to us and use that information for the purposes that you’ve provided it. The following are some specific use cases:

  * LinkSmart’s Contact Us Form – The LinkSmart Website contains a “contact us form” for Clients and prospective Clients to request additional information about LinkSmart’s products and services. The contact us form requires web publishers to give contact information (such as name and email address.) LinkSmart uses this information to contact such Clients and prospective Clients about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest, and to help us provide excellent customer service to our Clients.
  * Client Contracts – We generally require our web publisher Clients to provide PII as part of their Client registration process. We generally use this information to contact the Client if there’s billing or order processing issue, and to help us process invoices.
  * Testimonials – Some of our Clients agree to allow us to use their name and comments on the Website as part of testimonials. If you’ve agreed to have your name appear in a testimonial on this Website, you should be aware that any PII displayed there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this Website.



#### NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) from visitors to this Website. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system.

#### COOKIES

Cookies make using our Website easier for our Clients by, among other things, saving their login preferences.

You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please consult the technical information relevant to your browser for instructions. If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of the Website may not function properly or may be considerably slower.

### COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION VIA OUR TECHNOLOGY

#### OVERVIEW OF THE TECHNOLOGY

Our Technology is primarily designed to facilitate the monitoring, management, and delivery of inline contextual links and links to partner websites. The Technology identifies and, if chosen, highlights certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites. And when a user clicks on those words or phrases, our Technology links to other pages on the website or websites. For a complete description of how our Technology works, please click here (www.linksmart.com/features). LinkSmart aims to monitor and deliver links to Clients that align with your current interests called “LinkSmart Insights,” “LinkSmart Traffic Director,” and “LinkSmart Links +.” Our Technology identifies your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online, along with the links that you have clicked on. There is no PII transmitted or used whatsoever. The goal is simply to monitor clicks and to deliver links to publishers that are more relevant, interesting and useful for you. We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help report on links, and make the links to content you see more relevant to you, enhance system performance, develop and deliver new products and features, and for reporting purposes.

### TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA OUR TECHNOLOGY

#### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We don’t collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via our Technology.

#### NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We currently collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via our Technology, including but not limited to your IP host address, pages viewed, keywords and links clicked, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer’s operating system.

#### COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

Our Technology leverages cookies for the purpose of associating a visitor with their session on a Client website. This data is non-personally identifiable.

### CONTROLLING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

#### INFORMATION SECURITY

The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Website. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

We generally do not rent or share information collected via the Website or Technology with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share such information with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us. We may share Non-PII collected on the Websites or via our Technology with unaffiliated third parties. For example, we may disclose that ‘links pointing to x page’ receive more clicks than ‘links pointing to y page.’ This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. LinkSmart may also disclose user information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding. Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
