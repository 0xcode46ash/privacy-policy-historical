## Data collected through our contact forms

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998) and according to the Which? Web Trader Code of Practice.

We collect information about you for two reasons: firstly, to process your order; and secondly, to provide you with the best possible service. We will e-mail you only with details of the status of your order, order confirmation and information about updates to our service (assuming you don't opt out of this last option in the account preferences section of our website).

From time to time, we would like to send you information about our services and those of our partners by email. You are free to choose whether you would like to receive such correspondence, and should indicate your preference in the "Account Preferences" section when logged in to the site.

The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * Your name
  * Address
  * Phone number
  * Email address
  * Credit/debit card details



Credit/debit card details will be collected but, unlike other details, will not be held on our database.

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

We will make every effort to keep the information we hold about you accurate and up to date. You can check this information on the control panel once logged into lingo24.com and are free to make changes yourself or may request changes be administered by ourselves by using [this email form](https://web.archive.org/contact_us.html).
