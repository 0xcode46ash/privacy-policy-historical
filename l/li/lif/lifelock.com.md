# Identity Theft Prevention â€“ Identity Theft Protection

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.lifelock.com&sealid=101)Welcome to LifeLock. Keeping your non-public personal information secure and confidential is one of our top priorities. This LifeLock Privacy Policy describes our information practices. Please take a moment to read this LifeLock Privacy Policy carefully to learn how we handle your personal information.

This policy may change from time to time. By accessing our web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Each time you enroll, access or use our services or our web site, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, you should check this Privacy Policy when you visit our web site, and from time to time while you are enrolled for our service. Online customers may check our website regularly for updates to this Privacy Policy. You may also obtain a paper copy of the current version of our Privacy Policy by calling us at 1-800-LifeLock (543-3562) or writing us at LifeLock, 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, AZ 85281.

We take reasonable steps to (i) give you, a member of LifeLock or a user of our web site, clear notice when we are requesting or collecting information from you, and (ii) advise you of the types of information we collect about you, the general purposes for which that information will be used or disclosed, and the categories of users to whom we provide the information. Furthermore, we take reasonable steps to maintain accurate records, provide you with access to your personally identifiable information, and to safeguard the non-public personal information we collect about you through physical and electronic systems.

## How we collect non-public personal information

While enrolling for services, we will ask you for the following types of information: contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address); sensitive information (such as date of birth, driver's license number, and social security number); personal information to verify your identity, and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed fees for our services, and to fulfill our obligation to provide services to you, including communicating with third parties as necessary to provide those services, such as identification verification companies, consumer reporting agencies, payment validation companies, law enforcement agencies, or others.

We also receive information from you when you send us email, applications and other forms, when you enroll for our services, or when you call us. We may also collect information about your transactions with us, such as what products and services you ordered, as well as your transactions with any third parties with whom we put you in communication.

## Cookies

For visitors or members using our web site, we **may** also collect information about you through cookies on our web site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

We use log files on our webserver as well as third-party and internally developed Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology to capture and analyze this data.

## Links to Other Sites

The LifeLock web site contains links to other sites, including a third party referral program site. Our Privacy Policy only applies to information we collect from you while you are at and while you are actively in a session on our website. LifeLock does not share your non-public personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from ours in significant ways. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those web sites and the companies that operate them. In addition, web sites to which we link may use cookie technology to gather and store data about their visitors.

Any information collected in our store is collected by our merchandise supplier on their servers.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
