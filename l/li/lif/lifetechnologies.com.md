# Invitrogen - Privacy Policy

Â  | 

Invitrogen Corporation is concerned about your privacy. We want you to understand what information we collect about you and how we use that information. In addition, we want to ensure that you are aware of your rights regarding such information, and know how to contact us. Your use of our web site is subject to the following Privacy Policy. Invitrogen reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting to this web site, but such changes will not affect information about you obtained prior to the effective date of the change.

###### How we collect information about you:

When you register with Invitrogen via this web site, or when you communicate with Invitrogen via other means, you will be asked to provide basic contact information (i.e., name, address, phone number, e-mail address). If you send us correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties such as businesses send us correspondence about your activities in connection with your use of our web site, we may retain that information. If any third parties provide information to us about you, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, Invitrogen uses "cookies" only where necessary to enhance your web visit (a cookie is information stored in a file on your computer that is used to identify you when you log on to a web site).

###### How we use information about you:

Invitrogen uses information collected by cookies to make personalized features and other services available to you, and to ensure that our web site content meets your needs. From time to time, Invitrogen uses contact information obtained via this web site and other means to send e-mail and postal mail supplying customers with the most recent product information. If you order products via our web site, Invitrogen may contact you by e-mail to send you information about your order ( _e.g_., order confirmations, shipment notifications, etc.). Invitrogen may also contact site visitors via e-mail regarding their account status, and changes to any relevant agreements or policies. Invitrogen does not use its employees' personal information collected through the employment relationship for non-employment-related purposes.

###### How information may be disclosed:

Invitrogen does not provide the information you supply to us or that we collect via cookies to outside mailing lists. Invitrogen may share information about you with Invitrogen's subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and agents/representatives (for example, consultants).

Invitrogen respects your rights and is concerned about your privacy. We take steps to safeguard the information you provide to us. For example, all web pages transmitting personal or financial information are encrypted using the industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. However, you should be aware that technical and legal circumstances beyond our control prevent Invitrogen from ensuring that your information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described herein. For example, among other things, we may be required by law, regulation or court order to disclose information to government representatives or third parties under certain circumstances. Unauthorized parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions despite our commercially reasonable security efforts to protect your information. Further, corporate restructuring, sale of assets, merger, divestiture and other changes of control or financial status affecting Invitrogen may require disclosure as an incidental result of a transfer of assets by operation of law or otherwise. Therefore, Invitrogen and affiliates do not promise, and you should not expect, that your private information shall remain private under all circumstances.

###### We respect your rights:

If you do not wish to receive certain communications from Invitrogen or our affiliates you may have the ability to opt out by declining the service offered when registering or informing us that you no longer wish to receive such communications. You may also request to be removed from our database. We will comply with all such requests unless such communications are necessary for the administration of your account, required by law, or necessary to protect our rights.

You may at any time request access to a summary of the information you provided at registration, and may request corrections or updates to that information. Invitrogen will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to all such requests, but reserves the right to limit such requests to two per year per individual. Further, our response to any such inquiries or requests may be limited to information under our direct control. You may at any time print, download, or request a printed copy of this Privacy Policy.

This site contains links to the web sites of other organizations. Invitrogen is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites, and unless otherwise specified, does not imply any relationship, sponsorship, or affiliation between Invitrogen and these linked sites, or adoption or approval of the content of such sites.
