As is true of most websites, our Site gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts may be used by LifeStorage and our marketing, analytics and other service providers. These technologies are used to analyzing trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our Site user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

**Flash LSOs**

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as Flash to collect and store information.

The security of your information is important to us. When you provide sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number or a Social Security number) on our online registration or order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted security standards to protect your information during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
