### Tracking Technologies

#### Log Files

As is true of most websites, our Site gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts may be used by Life Storage and our marketing, analytics and other service providers. These technologies are used to analyzing trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our Site user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

### Security

The security of your information is important to us. When you provide sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number or a Social Security number) on our online registration or order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted security standards to protect your information during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/company/contact-life-storage/).

### User Access and Choice

If your contact or other information changes, you are responsible for correcting or updating your information by making the change on your member account information page or by emailing our Customer Support via our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/company/contact-life-storage/) form.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as otherwise required to process payments for your subscription for the Life Storage Services. We may also retain and use your information as we deem necessary to comply with our business or legal obligations, and to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.

### Site Referrals and Career Opportunities

The Site may allow you to use our referral service to tell a friend about the services offered through the Site or to refer a friend to a job posting on the Site. If you choose to use this service, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site or to view a job posting available on or through the Site, depending on the referral service you select. Life Storage uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Some of our pages, such as the Life Storage Career Opportunities pages, are provided by our service providers, even though these pages preserve the look and feel of the Site. Please be aware that if you apply for a job through the Site or refer a job posting to a friend, you are providing your information or request to third parties and not to http://www.lifestorage.com.

### Links to Third Party Sites

The Site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Life Storage. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the Privacy Policy of any website you visit.

### Blog / Forum

The Site may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your information from our blog or community forum, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/company/contact-life-storage/). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Social Media Widgets

The Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you visit on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing it.

### Notification of Privacy Policy Changes

Life Storage reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make a material change to our privacy practices, we will indicate on our Site that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new policy.
