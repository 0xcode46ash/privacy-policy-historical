# Privacy Policy - Life, Hope & Truth

LifeHopeandTruth.com is owned and operated by the Church of God, a Worldwide Association, Inc. (hereinafter the “Church” or “COGWA”). The Church is committed to protecting your online privacy. We feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via this website. You can visit http://lifehopeandtruth.com without revealing any personal information.

###  1\. How we collect and use personal information

The Church will allow visitors to create accounts and enter personal demographic information for the sole use of the Church. That information will not be sold or shared with third parties. By creating an account, visitors give permission to the Church to store and use said data.

###  2\. IP addresses

We collect and log the IP address of all visitors to LifeHopeandTruth.com. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. IP addresses allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with one another. We collect IP address information so that we can properly administer our system and gather aggregate information about how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing. To maintain your anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We will use IP address information, however, to personally identify you in order to enforce our legal rights or when required to do so by law enforcement authorities.

###  3\. Newsletters

We require you to provide a valid email address to participate in our email newsletter program. Your email will not be sold or shared with third parties. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future newsletters, we include detailed “unsubscribe” instructions at the bottom of each newsletter email.

###  4\. How we use “cookies”

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that some websites store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit them. Like many other websites, LifeHopeandTruth.com may use cookies to provide us with information relating to the sources of our site traffic. Collecting this information, however, does not allow us to personally identify you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so that you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Our site requires that both cookies and JavaScript be enabled. If you reject cookies from our site, some parts of the site may not work properly for you.

###  5\. What we provide to third parties

The Church does not provide any third-party access to your IP address and email address. This website may contain links to sites operated by third parties. The Church has no control over the privacy policies and practices of such third-party sites. If you have any concerns, you are urged to review the terms of those sites for more information about the policies applicable to those sites.

###  6\. Email communications

Email communication that you send to us will be routed to the person who is most able to address your inquiry. We make every effort to respond in a timely fashion once communications are received. Once we have responded to your communication, it is discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry. If you choose to use your own email system to communicate with us, we cannot control the security of your message. If you wish to keep your communication private, please use our “Contact” link (available at the bottom of every page).

###  7\. Complaint process

If you believe your privacy rights have been violated or if you have another complaint or problem, you may email us by clicking the “Contact” link at the bottom of any page.

###  8\. Changes to our privacy policy

We will occasionally update this privacy policy. You will see the word “updated” followed by the date next to the “Privacy Policy” link near the bottom of all pages on the site. If the “updated” date has changed since you last visited, you are encouraged to review the policy to be informed of how this site is protecting your information.
