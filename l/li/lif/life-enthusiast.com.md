Canadian orders are shipped by Canada Post.

## Security - Credit Card Safety

Are You Safe? Yes you are! When you place an order with us, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. This means that no prying eyes will be able to see your personal information while it is in transit to us, because it will be encrypted. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption software is the industry standard - it is the best encryption method available today for confident and secure online commerce transactions. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. All payment information is kept on a stand-alone computer behind a firewall.
