# LiftMaster Privacy Policy

**Privacy is very important to Chamberlain®.**   
It is Chamberlain's policy to respect the privacy of users who visit our Web site. To ensure this, the following policy statement explains how we collect information from you as well as how it is used. 

**Passive Collection of Information**   
While you are on our site, we automatically track information related to your use of the site. This information may include, among other things, URL tracking information, user's browser, user's IP address, files downloaded or viewed by the user and user's path through the Web site, date, time and frequency of accessing site and length of time spent reviewing certain features. We may also track usage through cookies. A cookie is a small data file written to a user's hard drive. Cookies may be used, among other things, to allow automated log-in and may contain information such as a Login ID or other information about preferences or Internet use. Since the cookie will remember who you are, it may save you time and effort in terms of filling out forms on the site that you frequently use.   
**  
Personal Identifying Information  
Special Offers**   
Within our promotions area, and at other locations on the site, we sometimes run contests or other promotions in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as e-mail addresses), demographic information (zip code, age, or income level) and information about their driving habits. The visitor's contact information is used for internal purposes, and will be added to the Chamberlain special promotions mailing list in order to provide the visitor with information about Chamberlain products and special offers from Chamberlain, and to third-party companies regarding products or services that may be of value to you. Also on the site, we provide you with the opportunity to sign up to be added to Chamberlain's special promotions list and receive promotional material from third party companies. 

**How Chamberlain Uses Information Collected**  
Chamberlain uses the information we collect to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage of our site, to improve our content and offerings on the site and to customize the content and layout of the site. 

If a visitor registers for promotions or sweepstakes we use the information collected in order to deliver information (including information about products or services) that may be of interest to the visitor. We may use visitor information to deliver information that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We may use e-mail addresses, mailing addresses or phone numbers, to contact users regarding administrative notices. We may use the contents of e-mails sent to Chamberlain for the purposes of promoting Chamberlain products and the site. 

**Disclosure to Third Parties**  
Chamberlain may disclose information in the aggregate to advertisers or other third parties for marketing and promotional or other purposes. When we receive your permission, we also share user information with our co-sponsors, business partners and service providers. We work with these companies to offer products or services which we believe may be valuable or useful to our visitors. Such third parties may use the information shared with them to provide these services and for marketing, advertising or other purposes, subject to their respective privacy policies. 

Chamberlain reserves the right to disclose user or visitor information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Chamberlain's rights or property, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Chamberlain may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

**Children**  
The Chamberlain site is generally not intended for use by children. We may have features on the site which are designed to educate children through a fun activity, such as our coloring book regarding garage door safety. These features do not involve the collection of information regarding children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any personal information about children under the age of 13 or market to them. That being said, Chamberlain may not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. 

**Security**  
Chamberlain uses reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of information that it collects. Chamberlain limits access to such information to authorized personnel only. Chamberlain uses reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the personal identifying information in its possession, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). Information collected by Chamberlain is stored on secured servers. 

**Other Sites and Third Parties**  
This policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information Chamberlain collects on this site. Chamberlain does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites or third parties to whom you may link from our site. 

**General**  
Chamberlain cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our site for illegal activities. Therefore, Chamberlain responds to subpoenas, warrants or other court orders regarding information concerning any users. We will, at our discretion, disclose information if we believe we are required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect us from legal liability or believe we need to do so to protect someone's safety or the integrity of the site.

Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as resonably possible and will become effective immediately. Therefore, please check this page periodically.
