# Privacy Policy | Lifescript.com

**PRIVACY POLICY  
Last Revised: October 23, 2017**

Lifescript ("Lifescript," "we”,“our” or "us") owns and operates websites ([www.Lifescript.com](http://www.lifescript.com/),[www.Lifescriptadvantage.lifescript.com](http://www.lifescriptadvantage.lifescript.com/),[www.ParentSociety.com](http://www.parentsociety.com/),[www.DealsforMommy.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20171230142303id_/http%3A//www.lifescript.com/aboutlifescript/terms_of_use/www.DealsforMommy.com)and[www.Prospectiv.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20171230142303id_/http%3A//www.lifescript.com/aboutlifescript/terms_of_use/%20www.Prospectiv.com)-collectively the "Sites"), publishes informative newsletters on a variety of health and wellness topics, sends daily special offers, connects consumers with trusted partners, allows trusted partners to send users newsletters and offers, and offers other advertising related products and services (collectively,“the Services”). This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how Lifescript, Inc. collects, uses, and discloses personal information in providing the Services. It also describes the choices we provide regarding your personal information. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. **We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. If we make any material changes to the way in which we use your personal data, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this page prior to the change becoming effective.** We encourage you to review this Policy frequently to make sure that you understand our privacy practices.

 **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We collect personal information in a variety of ways. We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, and any other information you chose to provide, such as your age, gender, zip code, health-related information, interests, and preferences. We may collect this and other information when you create a profile, register for our newsletter(s), use the Sites, leave comments or post content, respond to surveys, participate in promotions or contact us by email or other means for any reason.

We may also collect information about how you use the Services. This data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Services.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and to improve site functionality.

 **User Access and Choice**

Upon request, Lifescript will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, ask to have it removed from a public forum, directory or testimonial on our Sites or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at [service@lifescript.com](mailto:service@lifescript.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

 **TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES & THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS**

Technologies such as cookies or similar technologies are used by Lifescript and our marketing partners, affiliates, advertisers, third-party advertising service providers and analytics providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Sites, tracking users’ movements around the Sites, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to serve targeted offers to you. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We use cookies for a variety of purposes including authentication, remembering user settings and preferences, shopping cart purposes, maintaining user registration information and session tracking. The information in these cookies may be linked to your email address, which we may share with our partners in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of the use of information about your web browsing for interest-based advertising purposes by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, please go to[http://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20171230142303id_/http%3A//www.lifescript.com/aboutlifescript/terms_of_use/%20http://www.aboutads.info/choices). For more information about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.

The collection of information by marketing partners, advertisers, third-party advertising service providers and analytics providers is governed by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our service providers, you should contact the service provider directly for more information.

 **THIRD PARTY COMMENT SYSTEM.**

We use a third party online comment system called Disqus. Disqus is not acting as our agent. Disqus is a third party application that allows visitors to post comments on our certain of the Sites and connect those and other comments across multiple sites. When you post a comment, Disqus will collect information about your visit to this and other Web sites, including information you post and your IP address. If you register with and use Disqus, Disqus may collect and use other information from and about you.

When you use the Lifescript Services, certain information you post on publicly available portions of the Site may be shared with other users and posted on other portions of the Site, including without limitation your comments to articles, name, profile details, images, and messages to other users on the Site. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information when posting comments or other information or content to the Site or through the Lifescript Service, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others. We recommend that you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public online forums. To request removal of your personal information from our public online forums, contact us at[privacy@Lifescript.com](mailto:privacy@Lifescript.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We may disclose personal information we’ve collected to unaffiliated third parties for any legally permissible purpose including, but not limited to, the delivery of targeted offers and advertisements. We may also disclose personal information to unaffiliated third parties, including advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies for any legally permissible purpose including, but not limited to, the delivery of targeted advertising. These third-parties also may use that information to deliver advertisements, or for other promotional purposes, on other websites, as well as on other websites that participate in these third-party advertising service providers’ advertising networks, which may be tailored to match the perceived interests of the users.

We may also share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site and the Lifescript Services, and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we use the services of a third party verification company to ensure that the names and emails submitted to us are valid. Our vendors, consultants and service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

We may disclose de-identified information we’ve collected to unaffiliated third parties for any legally permissible purpose including, but not limited to, the delivery of targeted offers and advertisements. We may also disclose anonymized data to unaffiliated third parties, including advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies for any legally permissible purpose including, but not limited to, the delivery of targeted advertising. These third-parties also may use that information to deliver advertisements, or for other promotional purposes, on other websites, as well as on other websites that participate in these third-party advertising service providers’ advertising networks, which may be tailored to match the perceived interests of the users.

In certain situations, Lifescript may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to lawful requests, any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Lifescript, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Lifescript or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site or the Lifescript services.

Information about our users, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Lifescript.
