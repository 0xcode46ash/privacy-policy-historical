**LifeScript Health Profile Questionnaire**

The LifeScript Health Profile Questionnaire asks members for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or health history). We use contact data from our surveys to personalize supplements for our members when members place orders.  We collect additional contact and billing information (like their mailing address and credit card numbers) for order processing purposes only.

The goal of LifeScript is to give you the best possible shopping experience.   To do this we may choose to work with strategic business partners who offer new products or services.  LifeScript WILL NOT SELL your information to third parties.

This site has security measures in place to protect you from the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control.  LifeScript has encrypted the Health Profile Questionnaire, Health Profile Report, and Order Information sections of this site with a 128-bit Security Certificate from Thawte Consulting, Inc.

If at any time LifeScript is required by law or by a legal process to release customer information, we must cooperate fully.
