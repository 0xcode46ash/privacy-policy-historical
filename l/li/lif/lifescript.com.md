 **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain or may be tied to personal information. For example, we may collect information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number, and other contact and demographic information such as age, gender, zip code, health-related information, interests and preferences. We may collect this and other information when you create a profile, register for our newsletter(s), leave comments or post content, respond to surveys, participate in promotions or contact us by e mail or other means for any reason.

We may also collect "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

When you visit the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above.

 **COOKIES AND CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS).**

We automatically collect certain forms of anonymous information through the use of “cookies” and “clear gifs.” Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a website to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site and in e-mails to collect certain information about your use of and activity with our Site and emails.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we or a data provider we may engage may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to[http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices)

Except as otherwise noted in this Policy, we do not tie the information gathered by cookies and clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

 **FLASH LSOS.**

Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:<http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118>[

 **THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS.**

We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other Web sites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number). They do this using cookies, clear gifs or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.

This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for information you choose to provide in connection with these third party ads. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of the advertisers to learn about their use of your information.

 **THIRD PARTY COMMENT SYSTEM.**

We use a third party online comment system called Disqus. Disqus is not acting as our agent. Disqus is a third party application that allows visitors to post comments on our site and connect those and other comments across multiple sites. When you post a comment on our site, Disqus will collect information about your visit to this and other Web sites, including information you post and your IP address. If you register with and use Disqus, Disqus may collect and use other information from and about you. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Disqus' collection or use of your information.

You understand that when you use the Lifescript services, certain information you post on publicly available portions of the Site may be shared with other users and posted on other portions of the Site, including without limitation your comments to articles, name, profile details, images, and messages to other users on the Site.

We may also share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site and the Lifescript services and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we use the services of a third party verification company to ensure that the names and emails submitted to us are valid. Our vendors, consultants and service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to lawful requests, any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Lifescript, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Lifescript or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site or the Lifescript services. Information about our users, including personal information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Lifescript.

 **WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE?**

We have worked to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. You should also note that e-mail is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured e-mail.

Please note, however, that you may not “opt-out” of receiving service related communications such as account-related e-mails from Lifescript. When you register to receive newsletters from Lifescript, you are also registering to receive information or offers from us on behalf of our advertising partners. If you do not desire to receive such offers or information, you may opt out at any time. To do so, simply go to “Manage Your Newsletters”, where you may modify the information or offers you receive.

Furthermore, any information which may be posted on a user generated content forum or which you may post on a user generated content forum, including your personally identifiable information, by definition will be publicly disclosed and available to all users of that forum, and is therefore no longer private.
