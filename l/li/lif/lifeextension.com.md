## Collection of Data

_Personal Information_

We may collect and maintain any personal information you enter on our Website or provide to us in some other manner. For example, when you make a purchase from Life Extension or request a catalog, we collect information that you volunteer such as your name, payment card information, billing address, email address, mailing address, phone number, and other information necessary to process your order or send you a catalog.

Please note that when you buy a blood test from Life Extension, your results will be sent to a third party for processing. Life Extension may use results from blood lab tests and/or clinical research studies may be used for research, informational and educational purposes from time to time. Any data used for these purposes will be anonymous, and we will not link blood test results with any specific individual.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information via the Website, such as Website usage activity and preferences, also known as profile or demographic data, the IP address assigned to the computer visiting the site, the type of browser used by a visitor, the web page from which you came, and the operating system running the user's connections to the service. This data is not linked to you. This helps us make the Website as useful as possible.

The Website uses small files called “cookies,” which are pieces of information that your browser receives from websites and stores on your computer's hard drive.  Use of this technology helps us recognize you when you visit our website and thus allows us to personalize your online experience. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you'll return to a specific website with the same settings you used on a previous visit. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are currently on our Website, or that we may put on our Website in the future.

## What We Do With Data

The information we receive allows us to tailor our product offer and improve your shopping and browsing experience, making your experience easier and more enjoyable. It also enables us to process your purchases, confirm your orders, customize the content and layout of our pages, notify you about updates to our Website and products, and provide you with marketing information. 

## How We Share Data

We may enter into relationships with advertisers or other companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. In order to do so, we may share information like your name and postal address so you can receive the materials. We won’t disclose other information, such as your credit card account number, telephone number or email address. We just want you to continue to stay healthy and live better! 

We may also disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person and violations of LifeExtension.com's Terms of Use. Finally, we may transfer information, including any personal information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change regarding our Website. 

## Security

We take reasonable and appropriate measures to help prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information by carefully limiting access to the database in which your personal information is stored. Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances. 

## How We Respond to “Do-Not-Track” Signals

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time. You may visit [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
