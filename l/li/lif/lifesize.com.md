Depending on the type of Recorded Cloud Content, Lifesize customers may configure the duration of such storage and may delete such Recorded Cloud Content as they choose.

Lifesize’s corporate headquarters is located in Austin, Texas, and employee information and recruitment data is retained there and in other Lifesize locations worldwide.  Once a person has commenced employment with Lifesize, we compile a personnel file relating to their employment, and we provide more details about how we retain personal information at that time.

All service providers are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and process your information only on our behalf and subject to our instructions.
  * We may share redacted or anonymized information freely, but only after we redact it to ensure that recipients cannot use the data to identify you or link the data to you.
  * We may have to disclose information for purposes of protecting your or our legal rights or as required by law or to comply with orders from courts and government entities.  We may also be required by mandatory law to disclose your personal information to governmental authorities such as law enforcement agencies in countries where we or third parties acting on our behalf operate.
  * We may disclose information to another business entity should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity; or to any organization involved in a merger, transfer, or sale of our assets or business.

  * We may disclose information to protect and defend the rights or property of Lifesize, including its Site, or if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.



Before we disclose your personal information for reasons other than as described above, we will first obtain your consent, for example via e-mail, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out, or otherwise.  In the event that we disclose your personal information to a third party, we will require such third party to protect and maintain your information in compliance with our policies.
