# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

* * *

## The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on to the Lift iPhone application and to the Lift website. Primarily we collect information from users in order to create profiles, track progress toward habits, prompt users regarding their habits, calculate the aggregate efficacy of habits, and show progress of people from a user's social graph. The information we collect includes, but is not limited to: name, location, twitter account, facebook account, contacts, email, and progress toward habits.

* * *

## The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself to create profiles for other people to find out more about you and to show progress toward habits. Lift does not currently have the ability to hide your information from other users (although this will almsot definitely be something that we add).

We send notifications directly to your email address. Your email address will not be visible to other members of Lift unless you contact them directly. You may control notification settings through your account settings.

We plan to support data portability including CSV export and APIs. These options are meant to allow for programs outside of Lift to access your data under the same rules as above. They are also meant for you to access and export your own data.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our application.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without getting your opt-in approval.

* * *

## Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our application from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our application is structured to attract anyone under 13.

* * *

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by visiting your account settings. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information through our account management tools or by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
