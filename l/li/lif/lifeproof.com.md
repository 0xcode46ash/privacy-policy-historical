Voluntary submissions include requests to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, from participation in polls, surveys, warranty validation, and the like.

This information allows us to better contour our content to user needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience.

##  Usage Tracking

LifeProof may collect user traffic usage characteristics throughout its website. However, we do not correlate this data with individual user information. LifeProof may analyze usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from data contained in the user's browser.

LifeProof may collect and catalog search terms that users employ in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. We may use tracking information to determine the areas of our site most important to users based on the characteristics of usage of those areas. We will not track what any particular individual users read, but rather the performance of each page. This may help us to build a better web-based experience for you.

Additionally, LifeProof may place a "cookie" in a user's browser files. Cookies are very small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes.
