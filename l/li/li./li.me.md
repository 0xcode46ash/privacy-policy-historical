### The Types of Information We Collect

We collect two basic types of information from You when You use or interact with any of Our Websites, Apps, Services or Features: personal information and non-personal information. 

  * Personal information includes all information that relates to You personally and either identifies, or may be used to identify, You personally. We may collect the following types of personal information from You depending upon how You interact with Us or use or interact with Our Websites, Apps, Services or Features, including Your:
    * name; 
    * e-mail address; 
    * telephone number;
    * postal address;
    * credit card;
    * billing and contact information; 
    * demographic information; and
    * location information (collectively, “ **Personal Information** ”). 
  * Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify You (collectively, “ **Non-Personal Information** ”).



### Personal Information We Collect from You

Lime needs to collect Personal Information from you in order to provide you with Our Services, as well as to improve Your customer experience. You may provide Us or Our agents with Personal Information in several ways, including, for example, when You: 

  * Register for an account, create a user profile, or provide payment information;
  * Manage Your account;
  * Use one of Our Websites, Apps, Services, or Features;
  * Register for an event We sponsor;
  * Authorize Us to collect Your social media information;
  * Upload content to one of Our Websites or Apps;

  * Submit an application to work at Lime. 



### Location Information We Collect from Our Websites, Apps, Services and Features

With Your consent, We collect information about Your location from Our Websites, Apps, Services and Features. For example, while You are renting a Bike, We collect information about the location of the Bike, the routes taken by the Bike, and the rental status of the Bike. We also collect information about Your location that You provide to Us or enable Us to collect on Our Websites, Apps, Services or Features. We also collect Your device’s source IP address, which may disclose the location of Your device at the time You access Our Website or App. While You can always decide not to share information about Your location with Us, You must agree to provide certain types of location information, including, for example, the location of any Bike while You are renting it, if You want to use Our Services. 

### Personal Information We Collect From or Through Social Media Platforms

When You interact with any page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, We may collect the Personal Information that You make available to Us on that page or account, including Your account ID or “handle” and that the social media platform permits Us to collect, and We will do so in compliance with their privacy policy. If You publish Your social media profile on Our Service, We may collect Personal Information that You make available as part of that profile.

### Personal Information We Collect from Other Sources

We also may collect Personal Information from other sources or from Our offline interactions with You to, among other things, enable Us to verify, update information contained in Our records and to better customize the App or Website for You. We may also collect Personal Information about You from credit reporting agencies to, for example, determine Your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage.

### Personal Information We Collect Through Surveys, Sweepstakes or Promotions

From time to time, We may provide You with the opportunity to participate in surveys, sweepstakes or other promotions, some of which might be sponsored or conducted by a third party. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes and promotions are completely voluntary. If You choose to participate, We will request certain Personal Information from You. If there is a third-party sponsor involved in the survey, sweepstake or promotion, please make sure to review the sponsor's privacy notice.

### Personal Information about Third Parties We Collect Using the Tell-A-Friend Feature

We may from time to time conduct a referral service to introduce people You know to Our Apps and Service. If You choose to use Our referral service to tell someone about Our Apps and Service or a discount on the Apps and Service, We will ask You for Your contact’s name and email address. We will automatically send Your contact a one-time email inviting him or her to visit Our App. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of Our referral program. Your contact may contact Us at [legal@li.me](mailto:legal@li.me) to request that We remove this information from Our database.

### Personal Information about Minors

Our Website, Apps, Services and Features are intended for persons 18 years of age or older. Although Bikes may be used by minors who are at least 16 years of age, such use is under the sole responsibility of, and strict management by, the minor’s parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors. If it comes to Our attention that We have collected Personal Information from or about a minor, We will delete it without notice. If You have reason to believe that We have collected Personal Information from or about a minor who is under 18 years of age, please contact Us by sending an email to [legal@li.me](mailto:legal@li.me).

### Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Like many websites and mobile applications, We use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on Your computer or equipment when You visit certain online pages that record Your preferences and actions. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve Our Apps and Websites and make it easier and/or relevant for Your use. Like many apps and websites, We use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to record Your preferences, track the use of Our Apps and Websites and Your interaction with Our advertisements. We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, improve the Websites, Apps, Services and Features, and make it easier, and more relevant, for You. We also use cookies to: 

  * remind Us who You are and to find Your account information in Our database when You access a Website, App, Service or Feature so You do not need to log in at every visit, which helps Us to provide You with service tailored to Your specific needs and interests. A cookie is created when You register for a Service;
  * determine the browser You are using so the Website, Apps, Services and Features and Websites work properly;
  * assist Us with sending You e-mail newsletters;
  * generate analytics regarding Your use of Our App or Website; and
  * estimate Our audience size by determining whether Your visit is Your first. 



We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. We do not use flash cookies, web storage, web beacons or other technologies that track Your browsing history across multiple Apps or Websites. 

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on Our Apps. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help Us analyze how users interact with and use the Websites, Apps, Services and Features, compile reports on the related activities, and provide other services related to Website and App activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as Your IP address, time of visit, whether You are a return visitor, and any referring Website or App. The Websites, Apps, Services and Features do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies You. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google click [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

We may partner with third party advertising companies to better provide advertisements about Our goods and services that may be of interest to You. These third-party advertisers may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about You when You use the Websites or Apps. They may collect information about Your online activities over time and across different Websites, Apps, or other online services. They may use this information to provide You with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. These online advertising partners do not have access to, or the ability to use and Personal Information from Us without Your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track Your Internet usage across other websites and applications over which We have no control. We restrict their further use of any Personal Information they might receive from Us, they may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify You, without Us knowing or having the ability to control. 

Third-party ad serving companies and other unaffiliated advertisers also display advertisements on Our Websites, Apps, Services ad Features. As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on Your computer or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as Your IP address, browser type, the server Your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with Your server, and whether You responded to a particular advertisement. For a listing of the third party companies We may allow to place cookies to serve ads on the Websites, Apps, Services and Features, click [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/privacy-policy/third-party-ad-partners/). We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect, and We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those third parties. Please visit the sites of those businesses at the links above to review their privacy policies. We may add or change the list of third party ad servers from time to time and We encourage You regularly to check this section for changes. You can learn more about online advertising at [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers). 

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on Our Websites, Apps, Services and Features are members of programs that offer You additional choices regarding the collection and use of Your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit the collection and use of Your information by these third parties by visiting the applications for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youradchoices.com/aboutus.aspx), as well as the webpages for [Facebook’s ad preferences tool](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/) and [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php). 

You can also learn about Your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through Your device settings. For more information about how to change these settings for Apple, Android or Windows devices, see:  
Apple: <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228>;   
Android: <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/> ; and  
Windows: <http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out>  
Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that You will not receive advertising while using Our Websites, Apps, Services or Features or on other applications, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude You from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.  
Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Lime’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that We provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

If You delete Your cookies or if You set Your browser or device to decline these technologies, some functions of the Websites, Apps, Services or Features may not function at all, or may not function as designed.

### Consolidating Your Personal Information

We may use the information from one portion of one of Our Website, Apps, Services, or Features for other portions of Our Website, Apps, Services, or Features, and We may combine Personal Information gathered from multiple sources, including Personal Information We collect off-line or receive from third-party sources to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of Your customer records, into a single customer record or analysis or report. We follow this Privacy Notice with respect to all of Your Personal Information regardless of how it was collected.

### Emergency Situations

We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on Us or the Apps or Websites; (b) protect and defend Our rights or property, the Website, Apps, Services, Features or Our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of Us, Our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Websites, Apps, Services, Features or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.  


### The Steps We Take To Keep Personal Information Secure

We are concerned about ensuring the security of Your Personal Information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of Your information from Your device to Our servers. We store Personal Information that We have collected in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our security procedures mean that We may occasionally request proof of identity before We disclose Your Personal Information to You. We try Our best to safeguard Your Personal Information once We receive it, but please understand that no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.   


### How Can We Transfer Your Personal Information?

As We offer Our Services in many locations globally, We may transfer your Personal Information to or from these locations for the purposes of providing you Services. The exact location of where your personal data will be transferred depends on the location where you receive Service. A list of these locations is on Our website at [https://www.li.me/locations](https://www.li.me/locations?hsLang=en-us). 

Many of the countries to which Your personal information may be transferred for these purposes that are located outside the EU do not benefit from an adequacy decision issued by the EU Commission regarding protection afforded to personal information in that country. Details of these specific countries can be found here: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en.   
These transfers are made either as they are necessary for the performance of a contract to which you will be a party, or for pre-contractual measures. Alternatively, adequacy of data protection is ensured by standard data protection clauses that we have in place with the relevant recipient. A copy of these standard data protection clauses may be requested by emailing [legal@li.me](mailto:legal@li.me). 

In addition, the information We collect from you may be transferred to, and stored by, IT vendors who operate on our behalf, particularly to those located in the United States. We also transfer information to a number of providers of business application – such as CRM and marketing applications – as well marketing service providers.  These providers are primarily located in the United States.

The United States does not benefit from a decision issued by the EU Commission regarding protection afforded to personal information. Adequacy of data protection is instead ensured by standard data protection clauses we have in place with that third party. A copy may be requested by emailing [legal@li.me](mailto:legal@li.me).

### How Long We Keep Personal Information

Lime keeps Your Personal Information for no longer than is reasonably necessary or required by law. How long We keep it depends very much on the type of information and purpose. Following termination or deactivation of Your account, Lime, its Clients, Affiliates, or its service providers may retain information (including Your profile information) and user Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes. 

The criteria We use to determine the retention period for certain categories of data is as follows 

  * the length of time that You have an account;
  * how frequently You rent with Us or when You most recent rental occurred;
  * whether there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require Us to retain the data for period of time;
  * whether there is any ongoing legal claim that relates to any rental You have made with Us, or that is otherwise related to Your relationship with Us;
  * whether any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period;
  * whether the Personal Information is considered to be a special category of Personal Information, in which case a shorter retention period generally would be applied; and
  * what the expectation for retention was at the time the data was provided to Us.



If You have any questions about termination or deactivation of Your account, please contact Us directly at [legal@li.me](mailto:legal@li.me).  


### Linking To or From Another Website or App

The Websites, Apps, Services or Features may contain links to other websites or apps operated by third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Notice for Lime do not apply to information gathered through these third-party websites and apps.

### Governing Law

### Assignment

We may change Our ownership or corporate Lime while providing the App. We may also sell certain assets associated with the App. As a result, please be aware that in such event We may transfer some or all of Your information to a Lime acquiring all or part of Our assets or to another Lime with which We have merged. Under such circumstances We would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Notice, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, We cannot promise that an acquiring Lime or the merged Lime will have the same privacy practices or treat Your information the same as described in this Privacy Notice.

### Your Privacy Rights

You may have – in accordance with applicable data protection laws – the following rights when it comes to Our handling of Your Personal Information:

  * **Right of access** – You may have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information We have about You and to request supporting information explaining how the Personal Information is used.

  * **Right to object** – where We are processing Your Personal Information based on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) You may challenge this. However, We may be entitled to continue processing Your information based on Our legitimate interests or where this is relevant to legal claims.

Please get in touch with Us as set out in the _Contact_ section if You would like to exercise any of these rights or in case You should have any concerns about how We process Your Personal Information. You are also free to lodge complaint with the supervisory authority, should You feel that We process Your Personal Information in a way that is against applicable law.

### Your Choices and How You Can Opt-Out

We believe You should have choices about the collection, use and sharing of Your information. Although You cannot opt-out of all data collection when You visit Our Website or Apps or use our Services or Features, You can limit the collection, use and sharing of Your personally identifiable information. 

**Provision of Personal Information:** If You do not want Lime to collect Your Personal Information, please do not provide it to Us. Please understand that if You choose not to provide certain Personal Information to us, Your choice will restrict Your ability to access some content and use some of the functionality of the Websites, Apps, Services and Features. 

**Emails and Other Communications:** If You would like to change the types of communications You receive from Us, including opting out of promotional communications from Us, You may do so at any time by updating the communication preferences specified in Your account profile through the App or Website.

If You choose to decline cookies, certain features of Our App or Website may not function properly or remain accessible to You, including the App or Website itself. In addition, You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. Note that if You choose to remove cookies, You may remove opt-out cookies that affect Your advertising preferences. For more detail on Your ability to opt out, see Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies above.

Please note that while You may opt out of online behavioral advertising and other targeted advertising served by participating companies through App You may still see other types of advertising on the App, it just may not be as relevant or targeted to Your interests.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information** : If You have an account with Lime, You may review and change Your information by logging into Your account and editing Your profile. Be advised that We may not be able to delete Your Personal Information without also deleting Your user account.
