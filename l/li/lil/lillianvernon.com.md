The Kind of Information We Collect and How We Use It

**Personal Information**

We collect the personal information that you provide us while on the Site, such as your name, address, email, phone number and other data we need to complete your order, request or registration. 

When purchasing from the Site, you have the option to log in as a "Registered User" or shop as a guest. Although optional, registration allows us to personalize your shopping experience. Registration also offers a number of convenience features such as stored billing and shipping and credit card information, and allows access to member-only areas. 

We may use third party contractors to help us operate our business and the Site, such as personal shopping assistance, order processing and shipping, and assisting in organizing, processing and administering our data. We may share information about you with these third party contractors for those purposes. We provide our service providers only with the information they need to perform their services, and they are permitted to use the information only for that specific purpose or as required by law, unless any additional use of information is separately permitted under this Privacy Policy. 

We may also use your email address to send you emails about hot products, specials and online promotions. From time to time, we may also use your email address to send you information about selected third party products, services or offers we think may be of interest to you. Each email you receive from us provides a link to unsubscribe to future mailings by following the unsubscribe directions that appear at the bottom of each email. If you do not want to receive emails about our offers or products or those of these selected third parties, just Contact Us, call 1-800-901-9291, or write to us at: Customer Service Department, Lillian Vernon Corporation, 100 Lillian Vernon Drive, Virginia Beach, VA 23479-0002. If you are a Registered User, you can also choose not to receive marketing emails from us or these selected third parties by simply logging in and going to your Personal Profile.

We may also use your name, postal delivery information and phone number to contact you offline, such as to send you Lillian Vernon catalog mailings.

To enhance your experience with the Site, we must use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place on your computer to store your preferences.

However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on the Site. We also may use cookies to display to you products, programs, or services that you may find of particular interest. We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs" or "pixel tags") to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used in conjunction with cookies that conform to our cookie policy.
