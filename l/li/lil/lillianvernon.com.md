If you still have privacy concerns that you feel are not addressed in this information, please contact a Lillian Vernon Online Customer Service Representative at [custserv@lillianvernon.com](mailto:custserv@lillianvernon.com) or 800-545-5426.

What kind of information do you collect about me when I visit the site?

Every time you visit [www.lillianvernon.com](http://www.lillianvernon.com/), our web server automatically recognizes only your domain name and only collects basic information to help us best serve your current and future shopping needs. This data includes the number of pages you visit, types of products purchased and any feedback on site improvement or merchandise offerings.

When you purchase from Lillian Vernon Online, order a catalog or register to be a preferred customer, we only collect the information that you provide us: name, address, email, credit card and any other data we need to complete your order or request. Details in your profile ensure that we're only sending you the type of email updates you want to receive. We never share this information with outside parties.

When I place an order, how do I know that my name, address and credit card are not being disseminated around the Internet?

Our site is equipped with Secure Socket Layer technology. This means that when you access [www.lillianvernon.com](http://www.lillianvernon.com/) using a secure browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, the personal data you send us (name, address, phone number, credit card information, etc.) is encrypted for your protection during the transmission process and can only be decoded by Lillian Vernon.

I've heard a lot of talk about the use of "cookies." Can you explain what this is and how Lillian Vernon Online uses them?

"Cookies" are nothing more than small pieces of data that are stored in the memory of your browser and/or hard drive. These "cookies" are used to help identify you when you visit our site. This allows us to make your visit more personalized and convenient. "Cookies" also allow you to place items in your shopping cart, return to continue browsing and come back to check out at a later time.

How do I know that my email address will not be given out to other companies?

We do not collect the email addresses of visitors to our site unless you specifically provide it to us at the time of your order or when you register as a preferred Customer to be kept up-to-date about special sales, promotions and tips. Lillian Vernon Online uses your email to communicate with you regarding an inquiry or order. If you would like to ensure that we never make your email available to an outside party, please send an email to [custserv@lillianvernon.com](mailto:custserv@lillianvernon.com). If you have registered with more than one email address, this message needs to be repeated for each one. Should you wish to make any changes to your [personal profile](https://lillianvernon.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001), you may do so at any time.

When you registered with Lillian Vernon Online, you may have indicated that you wished to receive emails on new products and special promotions. If at any time you want your name removed from all future mailings, simply follow the instructions that will be included with any email you receive. But before you leave, think about all the great values and special offers you'll be missing! Thank you.

Once you make a purchase from our online store, your name becomes part of our customer file. As a valued Lillian Vernon customer you may receive catalog mailings from us in the future. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an email to [custserv@lillianvernon.com](mailto:custserv@lillianvernon.com), or call 800-545-5426 or write to us at: Customer Service Department, Lillian Vernon Corporation, 100 Lillian Vernon Drive, Virginia Beach, VA 23479-0004.

You may also receive mailings from other carefully screened companies with whom we sometimes share our catalog mailing list. If you prefer not to receive these mailings, please send an email to [custserv@lillianvernon.com](mailto:custserv@lillianvernon.com) or write to us at: Customer Service Department, Lillian Vernon Corporation, 100 Lillian Vernon Drive, Virginia Beach, VA 23479-0004.

In the event Lillian Vernon Online amends its Privacy Policy in the future, these changes will be clearly posted on our site so you can be kept informed of how, where, when and why we collect information and how we use it. If you have any additional questions, please contact a Lillian Vernon Online Customer Service Representative at [custserv@lillianvernon.com](mailto:custserv@lillianvernon.com) or 800-545-5426.
