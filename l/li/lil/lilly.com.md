## Data Privacy at Eli Lilly and Company

Eli Lilly and Company has established a comprehensive privacy program, including a global privacy office and a chief privacy officer, designed to help us respect and protect your data privacy rights. This statement includes both Lilly's European Union - U.S. Safe Harbor Privacy Statement and the Website Privacy Statement. 

## U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement

For personal information of employees, consumers, healthcare professionals, medical research subjects and investigators, customers, investors, and government officials that Lilly receives from the European Economic Area, Lilly has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. Lilly's Safe Harbor certification can be found at [http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list](http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe%2Bharbor%2Blist).

## Eli Lilly and Company Website Privacy Statement

Eli Lilly and Company respects the privacy of visitors to its websites, as a result, we have developed this website privacy policy. This website privacy policy applies only to the operation of websites that directly link to this policy when you click on "privacy statement" in the website footer. 

Through this website Lilly will collect information that can identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other similar information ("Your Information") when it is voluntarily submitted to us (however, see discussion below about "IP Addresses" if you have a broadband connection). We will use Your Information to respond to requests you may make of us, and from time to time, we may refer to Your Information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our websites, products and services. We may also use Your Information to contact you and/or provide you with general health information (like information on certain health conditions) as well as information about our products and services. We may also enhance or merge Your Information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes. 

Any other information transferred by you in connection with your visit to this site ("Other Information" - that is, information that cannot be used to identify you) may be included in databases owned and maintained by Eli Lilly and Company or its agents. Lilly retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them. Other Information we collect may include your IP Address and other information gathered through our weblogs and cookies (see below). 

This site may use a technology known as **web beacons** \- sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow this site to collect **web log** information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a "webserver"). The webserver automatically recognizes some non-personal information, such as the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 2000), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.

This website may use a technology called a **"cookie"**. A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the site and help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the site.

This website uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the website. 

You should be aware that this site is not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual under the age of 18. 

Areas of this website that collect Your Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL); however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection (found in Internet Explorer release 3.0 and above). 

We may share Your Information with agents, contractors or partners of Eli Lilly and Company in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for, or with, Eli Lilly and Company. These agents, contractors or partners are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for Lilly, or services for the collaboration in which they and Lilly are engaged (for example, some of our products are developed and marketed through joint agreements with other companies). We may, for example, provide your information to agents, contractors or partners for hosting our databases, for data processing services, or so that they can mail you information that you requested. 

Eli Lilly and Company reserves the right to share Your Information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law. In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state or company security is at issue (such as with the World Trade Center terrorist act in September, 2001), Eli Lilly and Company reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and customers with appropriate governmental authorities. 

We may also provide Your Information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this website to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat Your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

As a convenience to our visitors, this Website currently contains links to a number of sites that we believe may offer useful information. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies. 

To be removed from our contact lists, please write to Lilly at the following address:

P.O. Box 6245  
Indianapolis, IN 46206-6245 

Please note that you may continue to receive materials while we are updating our lists. 

We may update this Web site Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do update it, for your convenience, we will make the updated policy available on this page.
