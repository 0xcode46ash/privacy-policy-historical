# Terms and Condition

##### _PRIVACY POLICY_

We are committed to protecting your privacy and your personal information. This also applies to services and products offered by Licious, as well as any other applications, content or features that we may from time to time offer on our website.

By ordering from Licious.in, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. As we continue to develop our website and employ emerging technologies to improve the services we provide, this policy may change. We encourage you to refer to this policy to understand our current privacy policy. This policy last was updated on 1st June, 2015.

By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Privacy Policy is deemed to be incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Service Agreement.

###### _EMPLOYING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY_

We want you to be aware that certain online tools exist to help us serve and recognize you when you visit our website. For your convenience, to help us personalize your experience or better serve your needs, we may receive and store certain types of information when you visit our website. These are called ‘cookies.’ The cookies may be placed on your computer when you visit our site. Our web server automatically recognizes non-personally, identifiable information only, e.g., domain type, browser version, and service provider for each of the visitors on our site. Cookies do not provide any personal information but they allow us to understand how users navigate to and around our website, view product pages, access content and make purchases. We use cookies placed on your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser during your visit and when you return to our site. For instance, when you are ready to purchase an item, a cookie allows our site to ‘remember’ you have added the item to your shopping cart.

Our company contracts under an agreement of confidentiality with Google Analytics, a service provider that provides data collection and reports regarding our customers' activities on our site to help us better understand consumer patterns for Licious.in. Google Analytics may use cookies on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity so that we may continue to refine the site, improve it and better serve you. Google Analytics may store member ID, city, state, zip code, and email addresses on our behalf. Google Analytics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it back to us through a secure web connection. Under no circumstances may Google Analytics use your information other than in connection with providing services to us to make our site more useful and efficient. Licious.in does not permit Google Analytics to collect credit card, username or password information.

###### _HOW IS MY INFORMATION USEFUL TO LICIOUS.IN?_

The information we collect from you is also used to provide emails relevant to you. In addition, we may use such information to register you, confirm your order, your delivery information, respond to your customer service inquiries or requests and communicate other benefits and features. When you provide us with personal information about other people, (for example, you may provide us with a name and address for a merchandise gift recipient), we use that information for the purposes of processing the delivery and, in some cases, to communicate with the intended recipient with information pertaining to the status of the delivery. We rely on you to obtain the intended recipient's consent to our use of their personal information for these limited purposes.

###### _ARE THERE ANY THIRD PARTY INVOLVEMENTS?_

All orders are processed through the Licious Shopping Cart via PayTM and M Swipe. Credit card information collected on this website is stored on both Pay TM and M Swipe’s secure sites and are available to Licious.in for up to 30 days. Delivery and e-mail information is also stored.

Your information collected for PayTM and M Swipe’s secure online payment system is governed by PayTM’s privacy policy and M Swipe’s privacy policy. PayTM and M Swipe would request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and delivery address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used by PayTM and M Swipe for billing purposes and to fulfil your delivery. If they have trouble processing an order, they will use this information to contact you by e-mail.

We contract with third parties to serve ads on our behalf across the internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is an industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, e-mail address, or any personally identifying information about the user.
