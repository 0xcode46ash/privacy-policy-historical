# Privacy Policy | Your Security and Privacy | Liberty Travel

Liberty Travel, Inc. ("Liberty") wants you to know how we address privacy issues on the libertytravel.com web site (the "site"). Liberty provides the "Privacy Policy" to explain how your personal information will be treated by Liberty. Liberty reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of this Site following such modifications will be conclusively deemed acceptance by You of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Liberty will provide reasonable notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed on our web site; Please watch for such notices as individual email notice may not be provided.

The term "Third Party" used in this Privacy Policy means any entity other than Liberty.

I. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM SITE USERS

  * Liberty may collect and/or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of computer, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with Liberty or the Site via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, and contest entries (including name, address, e-mail and other personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding page views.
  * When a visitor performs a search within the Site, Liberty may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. Liberty may also record limited information associated with every search request made by the visitor and use that information to, among other things, solve technical problems with the service and to calculate overall usage statistics.
  * Liberty may place Internet "cookies" on visitors’ hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, screen preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, Liberty may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available; however, this may impair certain features of the Site.



II. USE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED

Liberty may use personally identifiable information in a number of ways, such as:

  * To communicate with you about your account, or to communicate information about the Site.
  * To build higher-quality, more useful services, such as by analyzing usage trends, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Site.
  * To provide you with prompt and effective customer service.
  * To support the operation of the Site (such as account maintenance and record-keeping), troubleshoot problems, resolve disputes, and to enforce our Terms and Conditions.
  * To inform you about services related to Liberty. You will have the option of opting out of further communications of this type by sending an email to:[unsubscribe@libertytravel.com](mailto:unsubscribe@libertytravel.com?subject=Unsubscribe) (Please refer to Section VII below.)



III. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED

Liberty may disclose personally identifiable information about you to Third Parties as follows:

  * With your consent.
  * To facilitate a transaction or communication with a Third Party that you have initiated.
  * To Liberty’s agents and advisors (such as our accountants or attorneys). We only disclose the personal information necessary for them to provide their services to you or to us, and only under strict confidentiality restrictions.
  * As Liberty believes necessary to: (a) comply with law (including court and government orders, and civil subpoenas); (b) enforce or apply Liberty's Terms and Conditions and Rules and Regulations and other agreements; or (c) protect the rights, property, or safety of Liberty, our users, or others.
  * If you partake (or we reasonably suspect that you are partaking) in any illegal or potentially illegal activity. We may disclose personal information even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, to the extent we feel is necessary to inform and cooperate with law enforcement agencies or other appropriate authorities.
  * In aggregated form, i.e., information about multiple users collectively without identifying any individual user, such as the total number of visitors to the Site in a given week.
  * Due to circumstances beyond Liberty's control. Despite the precautions we take to protect your personal information, the unfortunate fact is that there is simply no such thing as a perfect security system. Also, we have no control over the security of the Internet in general. As a result, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never gain access to your transmissions or information, or that personal information will never be disclosed in ways not covered by this Privacy Policy.
  * In connection with a transfer, reorganization or otherwise, to a successor-in-interest to Liberty’s organization or its other material assets.
