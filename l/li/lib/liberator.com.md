# Privacy Policy

**Your privacy is Protected.**

**When you make a purchase from Liberator, you provide us with personal information such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information, email address, and an order. We keep a record of this information which is covered by our privacy policy and is held in the strictest of confidence. All information submitted via our website is secure and private. From the time you visit our site until the package arrives at your door, and even afterwards, your entire transaction will be completed discretely and privately.**

**Your Information Is Only Used When Necessary  
** When you place an order with Liberator, we ask you to provide us with various types of information. These are used to verify credit card ownership and process your order. We do not sell your information to any third parties.

**Your Name and Billing Address  
** This information is collected in order to verify that the person placing the order is the person who owns the credit card. This process is performed by an address verification system which uses the numeric value of your street address and your zip code. These two numbers are entered into the system and verified against the address where your credit card bill is sent. We do not send out marketing materials via postal mail, and you will never receive anything at this address unless it is also your shipping address where you would like to send your order.

**Your Shipping Address  
** Your order will arrive at this address. It can be the same as your billing address.

**Your Email Address  
** Your email address is used to send order-related emails such as order updates and confirmations, online shipping confirmations, and customer service inquiries. You also have the option to receive our Liberator Newsletter, or you may choose to opt-out.

**Your Phone Number  
** We ship via UPS which requires a recipient contact number. You may be contacted by phone in case we need to reach you about your order in the event that there is a delay in manufacturing or shipping your order. Additionally, our customers do not always have access to email, and a phone number is used as an alternate method of communication. When it is necessary to contact our customers regarding their order, we try to provide email correspondence as often as possible. However, on occasion, phone contact is the easiest method. We will not solicit you or call for any reason other than in regards to your order.

**Your Credit Card Information  
** We require your credit card number, expiration date, and security code in order to process your transaction. Your card is charged only after the order is shipped. We do not store this information in our system.

**Your Age  
** We ask you to confirm that you are 18 or older to order products from our website. We do not sell our products to minors.

**We Protect Your Privacy  
** At Liberator, we take great care in safeguarding your privacy by offering discrete packaging and billing. When you submit your information to us, it is encrypted and secure, and you will not receive any promotional materials from us if you do not wish to receive them.

**Discrete Packaging  
** We ship all of our packages in nondescript brown cardboard boxes that are sealed with reinforced tape. The return address on the label is listed as OneUp Innovations, and there is no indication of the contents of the package. Your privacy is our utmost concern.

**Billing  
** If you use an American Express card to make your purchase, the charge will be billed by “OneUp Innovations”. If you use a Visa, Mastercard, or Discover, it will be billed as “OneUp Innov / Liberator”.

**Opt-Out  
** When you make a purchase with Liberator, you are required to provide your email address. This allows us to contact you with order updates and confirmations, online shipping confirmations, and customer service inquiries. Below the email address line in the order form you will notice the option to receive the Liberator Newsletter is automatically selected. The Liberator Newsletter provides you with information on sales, special offers, weekly promotional events, exclusive email discounts, and new products for sale. To opt-out of the Liberator Newsletter, simply uncheck the box. If you do elect to subscribe to our newsletter, please know that it is 100% US CAN-Spam compliant and you may unsubscribe or change your subscription preferences at any time. The Liberator Newsletter only uses your email address and does not store your name or any of your other personal information. If you choose, you may also submit additional information to our newsletter database such as your birthday, your partner’s birthday, and your anniversary, in order to receive gift reminders and special discounts.

**Security  
** Liberator is secured with VeriSign which supports the industry standard 128-bit SSL encryption. When you make a purchase with Liberator, you can be assured that your information is safe and secure.
