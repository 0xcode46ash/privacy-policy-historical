# Liquid Audio: Privacy Policy

| 

Liquid Audio is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our information gathering and dissemination practices. This document will be updated to remain consistent with new products, services, processes, and Internet privacy legislation. 

Please read on to understand how your personal information is treated when you use our products and services. 

What information do we gather? How do we use it?

**Liquid Player & Passports**

When you use the Liquid Player to preview or purchase music, we collect and store the song names you're previewing to ensure proper royalty payments to the musicians and song owners. We also gather the Liquid Player's version, your computer's IP address, machine type and operating system type and version for quality control. In addition, our Web servers gather the referrer URL, Web browser name and IP address to understand Web site usage ("traffic analysis") to improve the site.

When you use the Liquid Player to purchase music, we also gather your unique passport ID. Passports are used to ensure that your music is secure and to protect artists' intellectual property rights. We use two types of passports: Full passports and FastTrack passports. Full passports allow you to download tracks and move them between multiple computers. FastTrack passports allow you to download and listen to music on one machine. A Passport is a file stored on your computer. 

When you register for a Full passport or when you register for a Liquid Player Plus upgrade, we collect and store on our servers your name, email address, address, city, state, ZIP/postal code, country, phone number. This information is stored in the Passport. We use your email address to send you an email message confirming your purchase and upgrade to the Liquid Player Plus. In addition we gather and verify your credit card information. We submit this information to one of our payment-processing partners for verification. The payment-processing partner keeps the credit card number after processing. This allows them to maintain error and transaction logs that make it possible to synchronize credit card information with customer names. Our payment-processing partners do not share this information.

Liquid Audio does not keep your credit card information on our servers. The credit card information is stored in a protected manner inside the Passport kept on your machine. Do not give your passport to other people! During the registration process, the Liquid Player will ask you for a password to keep your Passport private. We will ask you for a phrase to help you recall a forgotten password. This phrase is stored on our servers to assist you in recalling your password. We also store information that allows us to see who changed or issued the passport. 

When you register for a FastTrack Passport, we gather your name, email address, post code, and country. We collect this information in order to restore a lost Passport, and for fraud detection. 

At registration time, we also remember if you've chosen to receive periodic communications from Liquid Audio. 

**Liquid Affiliate and Liquid Commerce Web sites**

Liquid Audio is a music distribution company. Retailers and music sites use our technology and extensive music catalog to sell music downloads as part of their online product selection. Others use our technology to offer their music catalog to you so that they may sell music downloads.

When you purchase music through one of our Affiliate or Commerce Web sites, we gather your name, credit card information, your email address, billing address, zip and country code, a list of purchases, and whether or not you have opted in or out of receiving information about artists or other marketing information. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. We submit the information that pertains to payment processing to one of our payment-processing partners for verification. The payment-processing partner keeps the credit card number after processing. This allows them to maintain error and transaction logs that make it possible to synchronize credit card information with customer names. Our payment processing partners do not share this information. When you shop with one of our partners or affiliates and enjoy one of its services, we may ask you for your physical address, your gender, your age, and to select a password. If we develop co-branded products or services with our partners or affiliates, they may collect personally identifying information from you, in which case, that partner's or that Affiliate's privacy policy shall apply to their collection and use of data about you. We also gather system information, such as your IP address, referrer address, Web browser name and version, and OS. It is your responsibility to keep your password secret and to change it frequently to maintain its security. If you feel your password has been compromised in any way, Please contact [Liquid Audio Support](mailto:privacy@liquidaudio.com). When you sign up to preview some of our products and services, we collect your email address. We use this information to identify you and, if applicable, your shopping cart, for normal traffic logging and analysis, and to gather demographic information. 

**Will Liquid Audio disclose the information it gathers to outside parties?**

Liquid Audio does not sell or rent your personal information to others. We return your name, email address, billing address, zip and country code, a list of purchases, and whether or not you have opted in or out of receiving information about artists or other marketing information to some of our partners and Affiliates and some of our partners and Affiliates may co-own this information. However, if, upon registration, you opt out of receiving marketing information, we will not, and our partners and Affiliates will not, send marketing information to you. We provide aggregate statistics about our customers-sales, traffic patterns, and related site information-to reputable third parties (such as artist rights agencies and our affiliates). But these statistics include no personally identifiable information. 

**What about "cookies" or other information?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Liquid Audio cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to look up address information you've provided to us in the past. This reduces the amount of information required for your subsequent purchases. In general, browsers accept cookies by default. You can, however, change your browser's settings so that cookies are disabled. Without cookies enabled, you can use most of the features in our partners' Web sites-including the ability to place items in your shopping cart and purchase them. 

**How Does Liquid Audio allow customers to modify the information it gathers?**

Please contact [Liquid Audio Support](mailto:privacy@liquidaudio.com) if you wish to correct or update information Liquid Audio has gathered. For digital rights reasons, Liquid Audio does not provide a way for you to delete your personal information online. 

**Summary**

Liquid Audio is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to assign ownership to and protect your Liquid Tracks, as well as for payment processing, traffic logging and analysis, and rights reporting. If you feel that you have experienced a violation of this policy, you should contact [Liquid Audio Support](mailto:privacy@liquidaudio.com).
