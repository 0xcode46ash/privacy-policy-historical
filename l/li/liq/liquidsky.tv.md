PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Liquidsky Software, Inc. Terms of Use
(the “​Terms​”). This Privacy Policy explains how LiquidSky and its affiliates and subsidiaries

The “​Services​” mean the services, including the SkyComputer and Sky accelerated web
browsing and any other service, mobile application, or website offered by LiquidSky. This
Privacy Policy applies only to the Services and does not apply to Third Party Services. Providers
of Third Party Services may have their own privacy policy, and their collection, use, and
disclosure of information will be governed by those policies.

HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
We may disclose the information we collect from you through the Services:


Our affiliates​ We may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries.
Service Providers​ We may share your information among our vendors, service providers, and
other third parties that perform services on our behalf. We contractually require these service
providers to safeguard the privacy and security of the Information they process on our behalf
and to use or disclose it only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with
legal requirements.
Other Users​ If you use the Services to play games, some information about your use of the
Services is publicly accessible to other users of the Services (such as through leaderboards or
multi-player gameplay). For example, other users may be able to view your username, profile
photo or avatar, and bio (if you choose to provide a bio), games played, and hours logged
playing. In addition, you have the option of sharing additional information using certain features
within the Services. For example, you may chat with other users or share gameplay video or
screenshots with third-party websites or applications or through communications features such
as SkyLounge. We are not responsible for how you share this information through these or
similar services. These third parties may use or share your information in accordance with their
own privacy policies. We strongly suggest you review the third parties’ privacy policies if you use
the relevant features.
Advertising and Analytics Partners​ ​We work with third party advertising partners to show ads
that we think may interest you, and third party analytics partners to evaluate and provide us with
information about our visitors’ use of the Services. These third parties collect information from
you when you visit our Services and other online services. Some of our advertising partners are
members of the​ ​Network Advertising Initiative​ or the​ ​Digital Advertising Alliance​. If you do not
wish to receive our personalized ads, please visit their opt-out pages to learn about how you
may opt out of receiving personalized ads from member companies. ​European users can also
go to​ ​http://www.youronlinechoices.com​. Please note that even if you choose to remove your
information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements. Additionally, many network advertising
programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your
online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted
advertisements you may receive. The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its
member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
Third Party Applications​ We may enable you to share information from our Services to third
party applications or services. You understand and agree that a third party application’s use of
information collected from you (or as authorized by you) is governed by its privacy policies and
your settings on the relevant service.

are required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii)
in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii)


when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect against or respond to
physical, financial or other harm, injury, or loss to property; or (iv) in connection with an
investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers​ We reserve the right to transfer information we have
about you to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in

HOW WE HOLD AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

for the security of information you transmit to the Services over networks that we do not control,

which it was collected, unless otherwise required or authorized by applicable law.

that your child or any child under your care has provided us with information without your
consent, please contact us at the contact information listed below.

If you are visiting from the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data
collection and use, please note that we may transfer your information ​to recipients in countries
other than the country in which the information was originally collected, including the United

share the information previously collected from you through the Services, we will give you the
opportunity to consent to such changes before applying them to that information.
