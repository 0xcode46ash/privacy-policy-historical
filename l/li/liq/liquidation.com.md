Liquidity Services, Inc. has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 

We log your IP address, browser type, access times, and referring site to help diagnose potential problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your user account. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your username so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. For our site to function properly, you need to have cookies enabled. 

Our third party advertising companies may employ the use of a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help them better manage content on their site by informing what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are NOT tied to users' personally identifiable information. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as their name and email address) and business information (such as business type, expected volume and transactions). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user our Buyer Alert email. This information is never sold or rented out to third parties. Users can Opt-in or Opt-out of receiving the newsletter during registration. Later, users who no longer wish to receive these emails may opt-out; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (for instance to verify registration information, or collect payment for transactions). Business information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration. Third parties may be used to verify the identity of the user. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

This site contains links to other sites. Liquidity Services, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

As a service to the user, the site offers a feature that allows a user to send auction details to a person via e-mail. The e-mail address of the recipient is used to send the auction details only and is not used or saved by Liquidity Services, Inc.. 

As a service to the user, the site offers a feature that allows the user to send us feedback. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard your comments. Your personal information is only shared with explicit permission. 

Auction information collected during the posting and bidding process is considered public information. The site also offers a Question and Answer message board. Any information collected in this message board is considered public information; see "Public Forums" below. Although the site facilitates communications between buyer and seller, no information about either user is exchanged. 

During the transaction process, financial information (credit card or bank information) is collected from the buyer to pay for the transaction. The site uses a third party to verify and process credit cards. All information exchanged with the credit card processor is encrypted. In addition the site will collect address information from the buyer to facilitate shipping of the goods. This address information may be exchanged with our third party shipping partners to manage the shipment of the goods from seller to buyer.
