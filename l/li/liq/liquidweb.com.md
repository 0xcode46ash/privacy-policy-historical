# Privacy Policy | Liquid Web

Liquid Web is an information technology service provider. Headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, we provide web hosting solutions including dedicated servers and virtual private servers to our customers. Liquid Web has data center locations in Ann Arbor, MI, Phoenix, AZ, and Amsterdam, NL. Our customers are responsible for the information they or their end users store in our hosting environment as well as compliance with Liquid Web’s acceptable use guidelines and applicable laws related to the stored information.

Liquid Web respects the privacy of every individual who uses its website. This Privacy Policy describes how Liquid Web collects, uses, maintains, and discloses the information that is collected from you, the user of its website. This Privacy Policy does not cover Liquid Web’s use of information collected through means outside of the use of Liquid Web’s website.

 **SCOPE OF POLICY**

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information that customers provide to us in connection with the purchase of our services and the creation or administration of a Liquid Web account.

 **INFORMATION COLLECTION**

Liquid Web collects “personally identifiable” and “non-personally identifiable” information about you when you access our website, purchase our services, or communicate with us using tools on our website.

phone number, credit card information, login credentials, and/or other such information that you would provide to register to use Liquid Web’s services.

 **“Non-personally Identifiable Information”** is information that does not determine your identity like web server logs, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, or personally identifiable  
information that has been removed or hidden (e.g. aggregation). We may also collect nonpersonally identifiable information as anonymous information. Liquid Web does not intentionally collect or maintain, and does not want you to provide, sensitive information such as race or ethnicity, medical condition, or religious beliefs.

 **COOKIES, BEACONS, TAGS, AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Liquid Web uses cookies, beacons, tags, and other tracking technologies to enhance your experience with our services.

You can change your cookie settings (www.aboutcookies.org), but your modification may limit your use and functionality of some of the features on our website. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers), however, we have no access to or control over these cookies. You may also opt out of targeted advertisements by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, however, opting out of targeted ads will not completely remove you from being targeted as you will continue to receive generic ads.

Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this personally identifiable information. Your information will be used to notify the winners, award prizes, and monitor or improve our website.

Further, if we use a third party to conduct the surveys and contests, we will not share your personally identifiable information without your prior written notice and choice. The third party will also be  
prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. Liquid Web may be liable for the appropriate transfer of personal data to third parties.
