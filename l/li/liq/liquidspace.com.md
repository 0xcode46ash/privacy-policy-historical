# Privacy Policy| LiquidSpace - Find a Great Space to Work Now.

By using, accessing or participating in the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy  
Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth  
in the Terms of Use (located at <http://liquidspace.com/terms/>). We reserve the right  
to change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we do this, we will post a notice that we  
have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site for at least 7 days after the changes  
are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Privacy Policy the date these terms were  
last revised. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective the earlier of (i)  
the end of the foregoing 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service  
after any such changes. If you do not agree to abide by this or any future Privacy Policy,  
do not use, access or participate in (or continue to use, access or participate in) the  
Service.

## The Information We Collect

When you use the Service you provide us with two types of information: (i) information  
you submit via the Service and (ii) information regarding your use of the Service  
collected by us as you interact with the Service.

When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information  
is gathered for all LiquidSpace visitors. In addition, we store certain information from  
your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer  
tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are  
logged in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a  
simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature;  
however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features  
(e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Site.

Through the registration process you may provide us with your name, company  
affiliation, email address, telephone number, physical address, and other information that  
may be requested during the registration process on the Site. If you wish to create an  
account that requires payment of a fee, or use services offered via the Site that require  
payment of a fee, a valid credit card number or other payment information may be  
required. By submitting your payment information, you authorize LiquidSpace to access  
and use this information in order to provide you with and accept payment for the Service.

When you use the Service you may submit information and content to your Profile, send  
messages, perform searches, submit reviews, and otherwise transmit information to other  
Users. We store this information so that we can provide you the service and offer  
personalized features.

We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures  
contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies  
of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users  
have copied or stored your User Content.

If you use the Mobile Software, your location may be tracked on the mobile device on  
which the Mobile Software is installed. LiquidSpace will not collect, transmit or  
otherwise use this information without your permission. As a Member, you can control  
when Venue Owners or other Members can see your location through your privacy  
settings.

## Minors

LiquidSpace does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age  
of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not  
attempt to register for LiquidSpace or send any information about you to us, including  
your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may  
provide any information to or on LiquidSpace. If you believe that we might have any  
information from or about a minor under 18, please contact us at  
[privacy@liquidspace.com](mailto:privacy@liquidspace.com).

## Use of Information Obtained by LiquidSpace

Once you register with LiquidSpace, you may create your Profile. Your Profile  
information, as well as your contact information, are displayed to other Users. We may  
occasionally use your contact information to send you notifications regarding new  
services offered by LiquidSpace and its partners that we think you may find valuable.  
LiquidSpace may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through  
the general operation of the Service. Generally, you may opt out of such emails, although  
LiquidSpace reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out  
of all voluntary email notifications.

Profile information is used by LiquidSpace primarily to be presented back to and edited  
by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others. In some cases, other  
Users may be able to supplement your Profile, including by submitting comments and  
reviews. Information from your Profile may be available to third party search engines.  
This is primarily so that potential users may be able to find you.

LiquidSpace may use aggregate data (based partly on IP addresses) collected through the  
Service to analyze Service usage and system performance. This data may be used by  
LiquidSpace and shared with third parties in any manner.

## Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

You may choose to provide information about you, your company or organization or, if  
you are a Venue Owner, your Venue to other Users and to the public by providing such  
information on public areas of the Site (“Public Information”). Public Information  
consists of information that is posted by you on areas of the Site accessible by other  
Users and/or the public, such as Venue descriptions. Public information does not include  
information you submit to Us but do not post on areas of the Site accessible by other Users and/or the public, such as billing and payment information (“Non-Public  
Information”).

We share your Non-Public Information with third parties only in limited circumstances  
where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, legally  
required or, permitted by you. For example:

  * We may provide Non-Public Information to service providers who help us bring  
you the services we offer, such as hosting the service at a co-location facility,  
sending email updates about LiquidSpace, removing repetitive information from  
our User lists, processing payments, or to provide search results or links. In  
connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers  
may have access to your Non-Public Information for use for a limited time in  
connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the  
processing of any of your Non-Public Information, we implement reasonable  
contractual protections limiting the use of that Non-Public Information to the  
provision of services to LiquidSpace.
  * We may be required to disclose Non-Public Information pursuant to lawful  
requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable  
laws. Additionally, we may share account or other Non-Public Information when  
we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property,  
to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using  
the LiquidSpace name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing  
Non-Public Information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government  
agencies.
  * We may offer to provide services jointly with other companies on the Service, and  
we may share Non-Public Information with that company in connection with such  
offer or your use of that service.
  * If the ownership of all or substantially all of the LiquidSpace business, or  
individual business units or assets owned by LiquidSpace that are related to the  
Site, were to change, your Non-Public Information may be transferred to the new  
owner. In any such transfer of information, your Non-Public Information would  
remain subject to this Privacy Policy.



When you use the Service, certain information you post or share with third parties  
(including other Users), such as comments, reviews or other information, may be shared  
with other Users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of  
information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose confidential  
information in your Profile or when posting comments, reviews or other submissions, this  
information may become publicly available.

Your posting of Public Information to public areas of the Site constitutes your consent to  
share such Public Information publicly. Please be aware that Public Information will be  
accessible by both Users and the general public. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall  
restrict LiquidSpace’s right to use Public Information.

## Links

LiquidSpace may contain links to other websites. We are of not responsible for the  
privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage Users to be aware when they leave the  
Site to read the privacy statements of other web sites that collect personally identifiable  
information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by LiquidSpace  
via the Site.

## Third Party Advertising

Advertisements that appear on LiquidSpace are sometimes delivered (or “served”)  
directly to Users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address  
when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your  
computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known  
as “1×1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising  
content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time  
they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to  
personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where  
individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine  
which advertisements are clicked. LiquidSpace does not have access to or control of the  
cookies or other technologies that may be used by the third party advertisers. Third party  
advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on LiquidSpace unless you  
choose to share it with them.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by LiquidSpace and does not cover the use  
of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

## Changing or Removing Information

Users may modify or delete their Profile information by logging into their account.  
Removed information may persist in backup copies but will not be generally available to  
other Users. Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share  
information with other Users (e.g., sending a message to another User) you generally  
cannot remove such communications from the Site.

## Security

LiquidSpace takes reasonable precautions to protect Users’ Non-Public Information.  
Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email  
and instant messaging are not secure communications, we cannot guarantee the security  
of any private information sent to us by email or instant messaging services.

## Data Transfer

By using the Service, you are consenting to have the data you submit to or through the  
Service transferred to and processed in the United States.
