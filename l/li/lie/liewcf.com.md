Your IP (that is to say, your computer’s individual identification number) will be logged on our server when you visit this Blog.

If you choose to leave comments in our Comments Section then, at your option, we use a ‘cookie’ to recognise you. A ‘cookie’ is a small amount of data which we send to your computer.

If you choose to leave your email address in your comments it will be viewable to other readers - you do so at your own risk of others using it for their own purposes. Leaving your email address in comments is completely optional.
