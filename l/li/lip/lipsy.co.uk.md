# Lipsy - Privacy Policy

##  How Secure Is My Information?

While we know that any woman wearing Lipsy can't help but get noticed, there are some things that a girl needs to keep to herself.

Â  At Lipsy.co.uk, we ensure that your personal information is secure. Every transaction is processed online using the latest industry standards for secure online credit card transactions. For those of you who speak techno lingo, secure servers protect your information using advanced encryption and firewall technology throughout the ordering process. We use high level SSL encryption technology and 3D Secure from [Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/personal/onlineshopping/verifiedbyvisa/main.jsp "Click here for Visa website") and [Mastercard SercureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/securecode "Click here for Mastercard website"). You can tell whether a page is secure as 'https' will replace 'http' in your browser address window. A small padlock will also appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.

##  Who Is Lipsy.co.uk?

Lipsy.co.uk is a website operated by [Lipsy Limited](https://web.archive.org/ImageStore/ImagesA/CMSImages/A091A005C5BE427BB5E56F0D93A048C5). We offer the latest fashion styles and trends delivered straight to the doorsteps of our customers and aim to be the most popular online fashion store in the UK.

##  What Information Do We Collect?

Our Website is free for you to browse through and read. We only ask for your details for the following reasons:

  * If you want to purchase product(s) from the Website
  * If you want to register your details with us on the website
  * If you want to take part in a prize draw or competition 
  * If you want to send us an email 
  * If you want to receive Lipsy news & exclusive offers via email 



We only collect personal information (such as your name and address details) if you choose to provide that information to us in response to our request.  
When you place an order through our website, we may collect the following information so as to promptly and securely process your request: your name, delivery address, telephone number, email address, billing information (credit card number, expiry date, security code and billing address), products purchased, Lipsy points and promotional codes. We may also (where provided by the customer) collect information for our own marketing purposes.

##  What Do We Do With Your Information?

We respect your privacy and all personal information obtained through this website is kept secure in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We use information we collect from you to process your orders and to offer you the best possible customer service. We will only send you marketing material if you have specifically opted. You may opt out at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link we put at the bottom of all our newsletters, through your account details or by opting out at registration. We will never share any of your personal information with third parties unless specified at the point of email collection.

##  Will You Send Me Emails?

We will send you email updates unless you opt not to receive them. 

##  How Do I Unsubscribe?

We always provide you with the opportunity to opt in or out of receiving communication via email. 

Lipsy's policy is to allow users to unsubscribe from our regular emails at any time. You can do this by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you've received or by signing in to your account and unsubscribing there. You will also have the option to opt out at the registration process. However, should you experience any problems, please contact Customer Services on 0844 844 0088 or [customerservices@lipsy.co.uk](mailto:customerservices@lipsy.co.uk?subject=Lipsy%20Unsubscribe%20Enquiry "Click here to email Customer Services").

If you have sent a message asking us to stop sending emails, and this hasn't happened, it may be because the email address to which we are sending them is not the same as the address you sent your request from. Please check the address we are using and include this information in your request. The easiest way to do this is to return to us the whole of the unwanted email. The address we are sending to is included at the bottom of the message. 

##  What Are Cookies?

No, unfortunately they are not biscuits! "Cookies" are small pieces of information, which are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. We may use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information, record what pages users' visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them and record past activity on a site in order to provide a better service when visitors return to our site. We also ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads and customise web page content based on a visitor's browser type or other information that the visitor sends. 

  


##  Your Consent

By using our website and submitting your information to Lipsy.co.uk, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Lipsy Limited. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If you are not comfortable with any of the changes to our Privacy Policy, you will have the opportunity to remove your information from our network at any time. 

##  Links

This website may contain links to other sites. Lipsy.co.uk is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. If you have a question about the privacy policy of those websites, please contact them directly. 

##  3D Secure

We now have 3D Secure as part of the checkout process on the Lipsy website to give you a safer shopping experience when using your credit card online.

[Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/personal/onlineshopping/verifiedbyvisa/main.jsp "Click here for Visa website") and [MasterCard SecureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/securecode "Click here for Mastercard website") follow the same principles as Chip and Pin and help to protect your card against unauthorised use when you shop via the Internet.

This process is simple and will give you added protection, security and peace of mind. You may have already registered for this service on another online retail site but if you haven't it's a simple process, as detailed below.

When you reach the checkout process you will have the opportunity to register for either [Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/personal/onlineshopping/verifiedbyvisa/main.jsp "Click here for Visa website") or [MasterCard SecureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/securecode "Click here for Mastercard website"). To sign up for the service simply follow the online instructions which are linked directly to your card issuer, you will be asked to set up your new personal password (which is linked to your card not the computer) and then once your card issuer has confirmed your identity you can continue to shop!

It's a one-off registration process which means that you will be able to use the same password for all future purchases you make with all participating retailers, not just Lipsy. And if you've already registered elsewhere you will simply have to enter your password.

Alternatively you can contact your bank directly to register. Please visit [Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/personal/onlineshopping/verifiedbyvisa/main.jsp "Click here for Visa website") or [MasterCard SecureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/securecode "Click here for Mastercard website") for more information.

If you choose not to register during the checkout process, depending on your card issuer, we may not be able to process your order. A different method of payment will be required to complete your purchase.
