NetElixir, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This privacy statement discloses the information collection and disclosure practices for our Web sites (the "Sites"). By accessing the Sites, you consent to the collection and use of information as described herein. We reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time. If we make any material changes to our privacy statement, we will post a new statement on the Sites and update the effective date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy statement whenever you visit the Sites to see if it has been updated since your last visit.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

  


## _Personal Information_.

Our Sites provide advertisers, agencies and businesses with various services related to internet marketing, pay per click ad campaigns, search engine optimization and other marketing services and tools. Our sites provide both free and purchased or licensed tools to help improve their business. In order for us to provide these services, we may collect your e-mail address as well as contact information, including but not limited to your name, company, address, and phone number.

We may also use a third party to host our Sites, including our online data collection forms. This third party provider has access to the user information for purposes such as maintaining our Sites.

  


## _Aggregate Information_.

Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed. We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our services and combine it with information about how others use the same service. Such aggregate information includes, without limitation, site traffic, page views, and impressions. This information may be correlated to you for our internal use only. However, we may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information (i.e., information that does not personally identify you).

  


## _Usage Information_.

We may from time to time collect information regarding your usage of our free software tools to help you better use the tools and gain insights in your marketing efforts. This information is used strictly to communicate with you and improve our tools.

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We use personal information internally to serve our users and to enhance and extend our relationship with our users. For example, by understanding how you use the Sites or our software from your computer, we are able to customize and personalize your experience. More specifically, we use personal information for the purposes for which it was collected (such as to provide you with the services), to anticipate and resolve problems with our Sites, to respond to customer support inquiries, and to send you periodic e-mails or newsletters, and for our own internal operations (including internal analysis as described below). You should review the following section to understand when we disclose personal information to third parties.

**DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Except as set forth in this privacy statement, we do not disclose, sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personally identifying information collected at our Sites to any third party. We will disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

  


## _Internal Analysis and Operations_.

We may use and disclose information about you for our own internal statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, user interest, purchasing and other trends among our users and to improve our products. We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal information about you to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of such tasks. We may also share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. We require our third party vendors to keep such information confidential and to only use the information for the purpose it was provided.

  


## _Transaction Processing_.

We may disclose personal information to third parties as necessary to perform services or to process transactions for you. We or our service providers may contact you to complete the transactions you have requested by any methods available including via e-mail, telephone, regular mail or other means. 

  


## _Protection of NetElixir and Others_.

We may disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy statement or our other policies or agreements; to protect our or our users rights, property or safety; or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Sites.

  


## _Business Transfers_.

In addition, information about users of our Sites, including personally identifiable information provided to us by our users, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.

  


### LINKS

Please be aware that we may provide links to third party Web sites from our Sites as a service to our users and we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those sites. We have no ability to control the privacy and data collection practices of such sites and the privacy policies of such sites may differ from that of our sites. Therefore, we encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such sites before providing them with any information.

  


### COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

We may use cookies to identify users and customize their experience on our site based on information they give us. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same site's Web server in order to personalize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site. We do not use Web beacons, or similar technology on our Sites. However, we may from time to time permit third parties to place Web beacons on our Sites to monitor the effectiveness of advertising and for other lawful purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug, " is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons collect non-personally identifying information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. We do not use (or permit third parties to use) Web beacons to collect personally identifying information about you.

  


### SECURITY

We use reasonable security measures to store and maintain personally identifying information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party while it is under our control.

  


### CHILDREN

We do not intend, and these Sites are not designed, to collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If you are under 16 years old, you should not register for our services or otherwise provide information on our Sites.
