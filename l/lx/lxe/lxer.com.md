# LXer: Privacy Policy

The LXer Team respects the privacy of the users of this website. Because we share your privacy concerns, we have published this privacy policy to help you understand what information we collect as a result of your use of this site, and what we do with that information. 

The type of information we gather falls into the categories below. 

| **User Information and How it is Gathered** | **What We Do with that Information**  
---|---  
**General Tracking Information**

We keep track of the pages you visit on our site, and our web server automatically gives us a report of the overall traffic of the site, each day. Stored within that report is your IP address, browser type, http referers, date and time of the access, and the page you accessed.

| We aggregate this data with the data collected from all the other users of this site, and prepare reports for our own use in determining the growth and usage numbers of the site. This information does not identify you personally.  
**User Registration**

When you sign for a username on this site, we collect from you your desired username and your email address.

| The E-mail address is hidden from view at all times, and is **never** released to **any** third-party source. 

We require an e-mail address because, unlike your real name, it identifies you uniquely. We will send you an e-mail confirming your registration on our site, and in the event you forget your password, we will send it to your e-mail address at your request. The E-mail address is also required in order for us to contact you in the event of problems, and is needed for you to take advantage of many of the features of this site (mailing other members through the system, receiving newsletters, etc).  
  
**Yes, we use cookies**

But only for login, and not for any other use.

| We require cookies only for the login of the system, and some navigational aids (bread-crumbs). They are not used for tracking, but are used to identify you, as a member, to our server and to assist with your navigation. Without cookies, it would be impossible for us to have logins and member accounts, rendering the site largely useless. This is the use for which cookies were invented in the first place.
