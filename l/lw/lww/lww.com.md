Privacy Policy for LWW

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our customers. The following discloses our practices on gathering and disseminating information for this web site (LWW.com).

We will update this Privacy Policy statement if elements of our policy change. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit our Web site often for this and other important announcements from LWW.com.

What type of information does LWW.com collect online?

LWW.com monitors several aspects of **general browsing** , including traffic to specific pages, length of visit, and shopping behavior. Click here to find out how LWW uses this information. 

LWW.com gathers **personal information** from customers in two places: registration and checkout. LWW.com registration is completely optional and if you choose to register, we will ask you for your name, e-mail address, LWW account number (if you have it handy - it is not required to make a purchase), mailing address, phone number (if you wish to provide it), primary specialty you are currently working or studying in, profession (if you wish to provide it), and workplace setting (if you wish to provide it). Click here to find out how LWW uses this information. 

If you register on LWW.com, you will also be prompted to sign up for **LWW.com Updates** , which include the _LWW.com Insider_ and _LWW.com Essentials_ e-newsletters. If you sign up for LWW.com Updates, we will ask you if you can receive HTML e-mail messages, if you are a faculty member and where you teach. You will be able to select the specialties you wish to receive Updates in as well as the _Essentials_ e-newsletters that best fit your profession or work setting. 

LWW.com Updates are sent from "Lippincott Williams & Wilkins" [ **orders@lww.com** ]. This information may help you in your efforts to filter out spam while allowing legitimate e-mail to get through. 

LWW.com gives you options for removing your information from our database in order to discontinue receiving future communications or service. To do this: 

  * Go to the [Opt-out form](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe)
  * Enter your email address (if it isn't already there)
  * Click on the unsubscribe button



Once you become a registered user, we may also collect additional personal information from you if you elect to participate in certain features and activities that we may offer on LWW.com. For example, we may from time to time post optional **quizzes, polls or surveys** that may ask for additional information from you (i.e., additional demographic information, product preferences, etc.). We may also collect personal information from you if you enter the online contests that may be offered on LWW.com. This information may include your name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address.

To ensure compliance with federal law, LWW.com does not knowingly maintain information provided by children under the age of 13.

LWW.com uses a browser feature known as **cookies** , which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by LWW to keep track of your shopping cart, to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your account information so you don't have to re-enter it during the check-out/purchase process. 

How does LWW use the information I provide online?

The information we collect from **general browsing** allows us to see which areas of our web site are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at LWW.com.

When you supply your e-mail address, we use it to confirm your order, provide requested information, and otherwise respond to your communication. 

Does LWW.com share or sell my information with third parties?

LWW.com does not share, sell, rent, or trade any individual's contact information, financial information, or unique identifiers to any advertiser or unaffiliated third party.
