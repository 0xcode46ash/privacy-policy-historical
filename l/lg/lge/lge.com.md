### Retention and Storage of Your Personal Information

LG retains your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) remains valid after termination of our relationship with you. 

From time to time, and as may be required for the purposes set out in this privacy statement, LG (or one of our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider) may process and store your personal information outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada, and under the laws of those other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access your personal information. 

### When We Disclose Your Personal Information

Except with your consent, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others. 

LG may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information collected by them on behalf of LG or disclosed to them by LG and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. 

LG reserves the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so. 

LG also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of LG or of any of the business or assets or shares of LG or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party. 

### Knowledge and Consent

LG collects personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use. 

The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances. 

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact our Privacy Officer at [privacy.officer@lge.com](mailto:privacy.officer@lge.com). We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent. 

We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided. 

### Use or Disclosure for Marketing Purposes

If you have opted in to receiving marketing materials, we may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us, our affiliates and/or our business associates, including by means of direct marketing. We may also disclose your name, email, phone number and mailing address to these affiliates and/or third party business associates so that they can send you promotional materials directly. 

You can choose not to allow us to use or disclose your personal information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference upon initial collection of such information or by contacting us as outlined below (see "Contacting Us").
