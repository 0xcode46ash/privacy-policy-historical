# Privacy Policy - FF Today

  
We record your personal information (name, address, e-mail address) only when you voluntarily offer it. We do not sell or rent any information you submit to us.

FF Today makes use of a technology called "cookies" which stores small pieces of information on your computer. Sites often use cookies to identify repeat visitors and offer them personalized service. Our sites uses cookies to keep track of your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. FF Today will only store information that adds to your browsing experience. This information is not personally identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most Web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. Check your browser's documentation and help files, or contact your browser vendor, for more information about its cookie features.

Registration at the [FF Today Forums](http://www.fftodayforums.com/) requires a valid e-mail address. This address is used only to send you your password, and to subscribe to our 100% opt-in mailing list, if you enable that option. Cookies are used in the forum solely for the purpose of letting viewers know about new posts since their last visit, and storing their forum password if they enable that option.

We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here ([www.sonar.com/naiprivacy](http://www.sonar.com/naiprivacy)).

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

Our servers log URLs and times of access to each page of our site, the referring URL and the IP address or hostname of the computer making the request. We use this information only to monitor the volume of traffic to the site, except in cases where we suspect a user is abusing the site's resources. In such cases, we will attempt to identify the ISP of the user and let the provider know about the abuse.

We also recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as FF Today may update it from time to time.
