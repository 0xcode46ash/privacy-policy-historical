##  Summary 

If you only read the FFXIclopedia, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general. 

If you contribute to the FFXIclopedia, you are publishing every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages and talk pages. Some limited exceptions are described below. 

##  Publishing on the wiki and public data 

Simply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (but see private logging below). 

When you edit any page in the wiki, you are publishing a document. This is a public act, and you are identified publicly with that edit as its author. 

### 

When you publish a page in the wiki, you must be logged in. 

If you are logged in, you will be identified by your user name. This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account. 

When using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by you or by another user with the same IP address. In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the wiki servers and can be seen by FFXIclopedia's administrators. Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below). 

Remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity. 

###  Cookies 

The wiki will set a temporary session cookie (PHPSESSID) whenever you visit the site. If you do not intend to ever log in, you may deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it. It will be deleted when you close your browser session. 

More cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit. These last up to 30 days. You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don't wish to expose your username to future users of the machine. (If so, clear the browser cache as well.) 

###  Passwords 

Many aspects of the FFXIclpedia's community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions. User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user's edit history. All users are encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them. No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to public release either directly or indirectly. 

##  Private logging 

Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using. It is not the intention of the FFXIclopedia to use this information to keep track of legitimate users. 

These logs are used to produce the [site statistics pages](https://web.archive.org/wiki/Special:WikiaStats "Special:WikiaStats \(page does not exist\)"); the raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded after a period of time. 

Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the wiki, including the suspected use of malicious "sockpuppets" (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of the wiki. 

###  Policy on release of data derived from page logs 

It is the policy of FFXIclopedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations: 

  1. In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement 
  2. With permission of the affected user 
  3. To the site's administrators when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints. 
  4. Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues. 
  5. Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers 
  6. Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the FFIXclopedia, its users or the public. 



FFXIclopedia policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above. 

##  Sharing information with third parties 

Except where otherwise specified, all text added to FFXIclopedia is available for reuse under the terms of the applicable license. 

FFXIclopedia will not sell or share private information, such as email addresses, with third parties, unless it is required by law to release the information. 

##  Security of information 

While FFXIclopedia respects your privacy and will act in accordance with this policy, it makes no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide. This information may be available to anyone with access to the servers, though rarely accessed except in cases such as solving technical problems. 

##  E-mail, mailing lists and IRC 

###  E-mail 

You need to provide your e-mail address in your Preferences in order to edit the wiki, and if you prefer, optionally enable other logged-in users to send email to you through the wiki. Your address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if the email bounces. The email address may be used by FFXIclopedia to communicate with users on a wider scale. 

If for some reason to lose access to your account, you may [contact Wikia](https://web.archive.org/wiki/Special:Contact "Special:Contact") to enter a new mail address in your preferences. 

###  IRC 

FFXIclopedia provides an IRC channel for use by the community, which can be accesses through various links across the site. Your IP address will only be available to network administrators, however your actual ISP name may be visible to anyone. You may request a vhost to hide your hostname by contacting Aikar or Ganiman on the IRC network. 

##  User data 

Data on users, such as the times at which they edited and the number of edits they have made are publicly available via "user contributions" lists, article histories, and in aggregated forms published by other users. 

###  Removal of user accounts 

Once created, user accounts can not be removed or renamed. Please choose carefully. 

##  Deletion of content 

Removing text from FFXIclopedia projects does not permanently delete it. In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version and see what was there. If an article is "deleted", any user with "administrator" access on the wiki, meaning almost anyone trusted not to abuse the deletion capability, can see what was deleted. Information can be permanently deleted by administrators with the oversight right, but there is no guarantee this will happen except in response to legal action or to protect the privacy of the end user (e.g. such as the unwarranted posting of addresses or phone numbers).
