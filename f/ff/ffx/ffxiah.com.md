**Final Fantasy XI**

  * We may ask our registered users the name(s) of their chracter(s) inside of Final Fantasy XI. We will link the character names with your user account after the user successfully completes a verification process. The registration of a character may be made public, but the user linked to that character will not be made public. 
  * All characters' auction house transactions are obtained from public price histories inside of Final Fantasy XI's auction houses. Therefore, all characters' transactions collected by FFXIAH.com will be made public by default. FFXIAH.com registered users may opt to hide their verified character's transactions.
