# Fourth Shift Site Privacy Statement

In Brief:

Our goal is to adhere to the highest standards of ethics and professionalism in all we do; a key component of this goal is to display respect for your privacy. This statement details our policies and practices relating to the use of any personally identifying information we collect from you. We collect only the personally identifiable information from you appropriate for a professional business relationship and to enable us to provide you with relevant information on our product and service solutions. We don't collect personally identifiable information without your knowledge, and we don't sell, rent, or in any way redistribute your personal information for purposes of solicitation to anyone outside of the SoftBrands organization or our direct business partners. 

In Detail:

**What information we collect**

We collect only the information that you voluntarily to provide to us, and that is required for us to maintain an enterprise solutions business relationship with your organization. For example, when you subscribe to our Fourth Dimension e-mail newsletter, we ask only for basic contact information and some general demographic data about your business, in order to help us provide relevant content. You can access most areas of our Web site without divulging any personal information, although there are instances where certain personal information is required in order to enable the use of a particular tool (e.g. <http://www.benchmarkreport.com/>), and a valid customer login is required for access to our Customer Home and support area. 

We don't collect data for data's sake, for possible future use, or to make our database appealing to outside parties (since we don't share your information - see below). We won't ask for your mother's maiden name, the color of your eyes or the name of your first pet; as fascinating as those nuggets of personal trivia may be, we don't need that information in order to build a productive business relationship. Please don't submit any personal information to our site if you are less than 18 years old. 

We do collect data on overall traffic to and movement across our Web site, as well as the referring page, to help us improve the content and navigation on our site. With millions of business Web sites in existence, we are honestly grateful that you chose to visit ours, so the last thing we want to do is to "reward" your visit by spying on you; therefore, we don't trace movement within the public areas of our site to an identifiable individual visitor, and we don't track your Web usage beyond our site. 

**What we do with that information**

We use the information we collect to help us provide you with relevant and timely communication regarding developments within our company, our products and our services. We use information provided by our customers to help us effectively deliver a range of enterprise solutions and to continually improve our product and service offerings. 

**Sharing of your personal information**

We respect your privacy and therefore we do not sell, rent or in any other way share your personal or company-specific information with unaffiliated outside parties (publications, list brokers, etc.). The information you provide to us may be shared with various departments across our organization as required for communication or business development purposes; with our closely affiliated business partners (i.e. third parties authorized to sell and support our software) for similar use; or with designated persons as required to comply with a court order. We may from time to time share aggregated demographic data (for example, "20% of our customers are manufacturers of machinery or capital equipment") about our customer base with outside parties, and we may share personally identifiable information with certain outside parties such as industry publications or analysts for specific purposes and with your permission (for example, arranging for an editor to contact you about writing an article on your company's use of our enterprise solutions). We may occasionally identify customer company names and use selected quotes, with attribution, in materials such as company presentations. 

**Use of survey data**

Surveys are an important and valuable tool in helping us to maintain our knowledge of your business needs, concerns, and priorities; to continually improve our products and services; and to judge the success of our efforts and make adjustments as required. Because your feedback is so important to us, we respect the confidentiality of your responses. Individual responses are shared only within our company and, in some cases, with closely affiliated business partners. We may from time to time share aggregated survey results (for example, "in our most recent customer survey, nearly two-thirds of respondents rated our customer support team as excellent or very good") with outside parties, and we may under certain circumstances utilize selected customer quotes in materials such as company presentations. 

**Web bugs and cookies**

"Web bugs" are transparent, and typically very small, graphics that can be used to track certain types of behavior such as individual Web sessions, without detection. They are insidious, and we don't use them. Period. Cookies can be used for a variety of purposes and are generally benign, although their abuse by some unscrupulous Web sites has raised understandable concern. Cookies may be persistent (that is, stored on your computer beyond your visit to a particular site) or transient (automatically deleted when you leave a site). Our policy is to generally avoid the use of persistent cookies and to use transient cookies only where necessary and for specific purposes such as storing session variables (for example, if you visit our site and select Europe as your region, we may use a transient cookie to let our server know that as you click through our site, you want to view Europe-specific information and pages). Because some unprincipled, dodgy Web operators may place code on their sites that attempts to surreptitiously read the content of cookies stored on your hard drive, we do not place any personally identifiable information into our cookies, only an untraceable random number. You don't have to accept cookies in order to use our site; you'll have access to virtually all of the key functionality on our site whether your system is configured to accept cookies or not. 

**Subscribe / unsubscribe capabilities (spam policy)**

Unwanted e-mail, commonly referred to as spam: almost everybody gets at least some, and virtually no one likes it. We strive to make all of our communications with our customers and prospects relevant and welcome; the last thing we want is to have any of our communications viewed as spam. Although we can't guarantee that you will never receive an unsolicited e-mail from our organization, our policy is, whenever possible, to send messages only with the permission of the recipient; to make it easy to subscribe and unsubscribe to our electronic communications; and to make it easy to provide us with feedback or changes to your subscription information. To that end, we never send e-mails without the sender clearly identified; for e-mail publications sent out at regular intervals (such as newsletters) we usually provide an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom; and for regularly-scheduled customer communications, we will provide a subscription management capability in the Customer Home area of this site. 

**Making changes to your data**

Subscribers to our Fourth Dimension newsletter or other interested individuals can make changes to the information we have collected from you by following the instructions in the footer of the newsletter or by sending an e-mail to webmaster@fs.com. Customers can edit and update the information we have on file for them by following the instructions in the My Company area of the Customer Home page. 

**Web site links**

Links to other Web sites are provided at various places on our site. Regardless of the nature of our relationship with the operators of these sites, we are not responsible for their privacy policies, data collection and use practices or site content. 

**Protection from intrusion and theft**

We necessarily collect some personal and company-specific information from our customers, newsletter subscribers and other interested parties who voluntarily provide us with such information. We appreciate the trust you place in us to safeguard this data. While no one can absolutely guarantee that the information that they collect from you, online or offline, will not be compromised due to electronic intrusion or theft, our company makes every reasonable effort to protect your data by: 

  * following security best practices (such as the use of a "DMZ");
  * utilizing intrusion detection and prevention tools (such as firewalls);
  * monitoring industry security alerts; and
  * promptly applying vendor security patches to our operating systems and applications.



**Changes to this policy**

We may from time to time amend this Privacy Policy, without notice, to assure that we adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, to assure that our corporate practices and statements are in alignment, and to reflect changes in business processes and technology. Therefore, you should review this policy periodically to assure that you are aware of what personal information we collect and how we use it. We will, however, never waiver from our commitment to respect the trust to place in us and to demonstrate the value we place on our business relationship with you by maintaining the confidentiality of the personal and company-specific information that you provide to us. 

**How to contact us**

Please address any questions or comments on this Privacy Policy or related matters to [webmaster@fs.com](mailto:webmaster@fs.com). 

We'd like our Privacy Policy to serve as a model for the industry. For information on the free re-use of this policy, send an e-mail to our Webmaster.
