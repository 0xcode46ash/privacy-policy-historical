We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and for aspects of session management, like the operation of the shopping cart. However, IP addresses are never associated with a specific identifier, and are not used to identify you.

By entering Live Chat, the user agrees to be contacted for discussion relating to the subject of the conversation in the future.

If a user provides his or her email address within their submission, we may use the information to contact you to proactively resolve any potential issues. All reviews that are submitted belong to the property of FS and we reserve the right to use and reproduce these reviews in whole or in part without any reference to personally identifiable information.
