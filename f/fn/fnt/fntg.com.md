use of your information by a business partner may be subject to that party’s own Privacy Notice. Unless permitted by law,
we do not disclose information we collect from consumer or credit reporting agencies with our affiliates or others without
your consent.

with the sale or other disposition of all or part of the FNF business and/or assets, or in the event of our bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership or an assignment for the benefit of creditors. You expressly agree and consent to
the use and/or transfer of the foregoing information in connection with any of the above described proceedings. We cannot
and will not be responsible for any breach of security by a third party or for any actions of any third party that receives any

 mortgage loan servicer is responsible for taking action or making changes to any consumer information submitted
 through this website. For example, if you believe that your payment or user information is incorrect, you must
 contact your mortgage loan servicer.
CCN does not share consumer information with third parties, other than (1) those with which the mortgage loan servicer
has contracted to interface with the CCN application, or (2) law enforcement or other governmental authority in connection
with an investigation, or civil or criminal subpoenas or court orders. All sections of this Privacy Notice apply to your
