# Comics.com | Privacy Information

The United Media site is committed to maintaining the privacy of its visitors. 

### Gathering & Use of Information

United Media does not require personal information from visitors in order to gain access to any part of Comics.com. Any requests for personal data is entirely voluntary. 

Information that is gathered online is used to improve our web siteâ€™s content. In addition, we may use the information gathered to conduct internal marketing analysis to improve our web site for our users. 

In some instances, users wishing to receive future e- mailings from us as well as e-mailings from other entertainment companies will be asked to opt-in on line. The personal information provided by users who chose to opt-in for these mailings will be used by us and are likely to be disclosed to third parties for purposes of providing mailings. All e-mail mailings from us or from the third parties that have received the lists from us will provide a way for users who receive those mailings to request that their names be taken off mailing lists and have future mailings cease. 

Children 12 years of age and younger are not permitted to opt in for these future e-mailings because the opt in software requires users to fill in their age and only users above 12 years of age are able to submit opt in authorizations. 

All third party e-mailings will be handled by ConsumerNet, an e-Trust backed company. To read their privacy policy, [click here](http://www.consumernet.com/html/privacy.htm). 

### Information Tracking

United Media uses an outside service to track the total number of visitors to each area of Comics.com. Compiled in an aggregate form, this information shows us which areas visitors enjoy most, and allows us to update and improve site content. Personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. 

### "Cookies"

The United Media site contracts with DoubleClick to sell and manage the advertisements that you see on the site. The advertisements help us bring you the United Media site without charge. DoubleClick uses "cookies" to improve the quality of your visit to the United Media site. "Cookies" are a form of software technology used to collect non-personal information about visitors to any particular site. This type of information includes: type of browser used to access the Internet (i.e. Netscape3.0, Internet Explorer 4.0), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh) and the domain of the visitor's Internet service provider. 

DoubleClick uses cookies to make sure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly and when possible, shows advertising that is relevant to you based on what you have seen previously. Cookies are anonymous. DoubleClick does not know the name, e-mail address, phone number, or home address of anybody who visits the United Media site or any other site in the DoubleClick Network. All users receiving an ad from DoubleClick through the United Media site therefore remain entirely anonymous to DoubleClick; DoubleClick does not have any information to sell or rent to other parties. 

DoubleClick makes available both its policies and information practices at [www.doubleclick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/) and has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing.

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by users. When collecting credit card information for on-line purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it. When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an area where the general public does not have access to it. 

Note: United Media reserves the right to update this policy at any time.
