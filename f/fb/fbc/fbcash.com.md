**Privacy Policy**

Our privacy policy is pretty simple. We will never sell any of the information we collect about you to anyone. Ever. 

We only use your information to... 

1) Send you updates and notifications about your account - like when we've sent a payment your way.

2) Send your payment to you electronically or by check. In doing so, FBCash.com provides USBank with your name, address, and phone number, for the purpose of making sure your payment is delivered to you.

3) Fight fraud and make sure no one is cheating. 

You may willingly give out information about yourself to our advertisers as you complete offers, but we will never give them that information. 

Simply put, your information is safe with us.
