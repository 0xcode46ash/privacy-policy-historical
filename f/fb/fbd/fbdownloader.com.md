A.       HTTO uses cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags, to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within, and through, our web site. The Applications we distribute also use cookies to provide us with retention and usage information and to store user preferences. 

B.       Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allows us to store and retrieve login information on a User's computer or other electronic device.  Our server automatically asks a new User's browser whether it will accept our cookie file. If the cookie is accepted, our server will record the cookie's unique ID for our use in internal reporting. Every time the User returns to the web site or uses our Applications, we will be able to read that cookie's ID number and, among other things, can customize the services we deliver, based on the User's past preferences. 

C.      If a User accepts our cookie, but later wants to remove it, it can be deleted through User’s web browser. 

D.      _Cookies & web beacons_ may be used by our third-party advertisers to identify you.

E.       HTTO does not use _cookies_ to store information such as Paypal payment information, telephone numbers, or other information you provide. To maintain your privacy, you can disable your browser's ability to accept _cookies,_ but doing so may affect your ability to access and navigate our web site.

F.       Our third-party advertisers may use _cookies & web beacons_ on your computer in order to identify you to their servers. We have no access to or control over these _cookies or web beacons,_ hence, we will not be responsible for their use or misuse.

G.      This _Policy_ covers the use of _cookies & web beacons_ by AAndex. It does not cover the use of _cookies & web beacons _by any other third-party advertiser.

**_VIII.  Is My Information Private With FBDownloader Advertisers?_**

  
A.       Each of our third-party advertiser web sites (in the Free Version of the application) may have a _Privacy Policy_ that differs from that of HTTO. The privacy practices of third-party advertisers are not covered by our _Privacy Policy_. 

B.      

When you use the Free Version of the FBDownloader Software Application, you will see advertisements that are periodically updated. These advertisement messages typically come from third-party advertisement servers or advertisement networks. 
    
    
    C.         The ‘free version’ of FBDownloader may contain advertisements that, when clicked, take you to Internet sites managed by third parties. By activating these links, you are no longer using the FBDownloader Software Application.  FBDownloader has no control over Internet sites owned by third parties. These sites are managed entirely by third parties and FBDownloader cannot make any declaration whatsoever concerning the quality or overall content thereof, nor regarding the quality of the products offered, or the security of performing transactions on the sites in question. The fact that third party sites are identified on the FBDownloader Software Application should not, in any way, be interpreted as an endorsement by HTTO.

FBDownloader cannot be held liable for possible damages arising from the use of such third party sites. All complaints about third party sites should be addressed to the administrators of those sites.
    
    
     
    
    
    D.         Some of these advertising networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement message. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by an online server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by an online server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 
    
    
     
    
    
    E.         Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Note that the FBDownloader Software Application does not use cookies, and does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party advertising servers or networks. 
    
    
     
    
    
    F.         Advertising messages displayed in the ‘Free Version’ of the FBDownloader Software Application may contain electronic images known as Web Beacons - sometimes called ‘single-pixel gifs’ - in order to help compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. We prohibit Web Beacons in advertisements displayed in the ‘Free Version’ of the FBDownloader Software Application from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.
    
    
     
    
    
    G.         Finally, HTTO may work with other companies that advertise in the ‘Free Version’ of the FBDownloader Software Application, in order to place Web Beacons on their web sites, in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement in our application results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's web site. In these ways, HTTO and the advertising networks may compile information about what advertisements are seen in the ‘Free Version’ of the FBDownloader Software Application and determine which advertisements are clicked on by Users. In addition, advertising messages may be stored on your computer for display while you are offline. 
    
    
     
    
    
    H.         HTTO may compile information about what advertising messages are seen in the ‘Free Version’ of the FBDownloader Software Application, and determine which advertising messages are clicked on and may share that information with advertising networks. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. HTTO may use demographic information collected from you during the registration process (including age, location and gender data) to target advertisements that we believe will be of most interest to you. ** _IX.       What About Data Security?_** 

  
A.       To ensure the security of your data, including address information, HTTO always uses industry-standard encryption technologies (256kb _Secure Socket Layer_ – SSL) when transferring and receiving User data on our web site. 

B.       HTTO has instituted appropriate security measures that protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from Users. 

C.      HTTO requires that our third-party advertisers ensure the security of the data that Users provide to them, however, in the event of a breach of their security measures, User agrees that HTTO will not be liable for any loss or damage to you.

D.      HTTO limits access to personal information about Users to employees for whom we reasonably believe it is necessary, in order to provide products or services. 

E.       HTTO has physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with international regulations to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our web site.
