# F45 : Functional Training - Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Training US, franchise Personal Training

F45 Training Pty Ltd ACN 162 731 900 and its Related Bodies Corporate (as defined in the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth)) (“ **F45** ” or “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”) recognise the importance of protecting personal information. This privacy policy (“ **Policy** ”) explains how F45 protects the privacy of individuals and summarises how the company collects, uses and discloses personal information about individuals. “ _Personal Information_ ” is information that identifies you, or information by which your identity can reasonably be ascertained. 

F45 is bound to comply with the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the Australian Privacy Principles (“ **APPs** ”) that regulate the handling of personal information about individuals. 

**1\. Management of Personal Information**

**(a) Information F45 collects**

From time to time F45 will collect personal information from website users, franchisees, members of franchisees, customers, suppliers, recruitment agencies, employees, contractors and other individuals (for example business contacts and potential new franchisees). The type of personal information that may be collected will depend on F45’s relationship with the person, and the circumstances of collection. Information collected from individuals may include the following:

  * name, date of birth and place of birth;
  * residential address, email address, facsimile number and contact telephone numbers; 
  * financial information, including bank account details and credit / debit card details so we can make and receive payments; 
  * employment and contractor information such as resumes, third party references, superannuation details, tax file numbers, emergency contact details and employee or contractor records; and
  * details about website users through the use of cookies. 



We may also collect copies of identification documents from individuals, for example driver licences, birth certificates and/or passports. 

**(b) How F45 collects information**

How we collect personal information will largely depend on whose information we are collecting. If it is reasonable and practical to do so, we collect personal information directly from you. 

  
We may collect information about you when you:

  * become a franchisee;
  * engage F45 for the provision of services; 
  * request information from us;
  * interact or conduct business with F45;
  * telephone, email or write to us; 
  * contact us through our website; 
  * register to receive newsletters and other information from us;
  * register for special events or promotions;
  * enter contests or respond to surveys;
  * apply for employment with F45; or
  * have a face to face meeting with a representative of F45.



As well as collecting information directly from an individual, there may be occasions when F45 collects information from a third party, which will supplement the information held by F45. 

We may collect personal information from: 

  * entities that are Related Bodies Corporate (as defined in the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth)) of F45; 
  * franchisees; and
  * independent sources.



We will however only collect information from third parties where it is not reasonable and practical to collect the information from you directly.

**(c) Gathering and combining personal information**

  
Improvements in technology enable organisations to collect and use personal information to get a more integrated view of individuals, and to allow them to provide better products and services to individuals. 

We may combine information made available from a variety of sources. This enables us to analyse the data in order to gain useful insights, which can be used for the purposes mentioned in Section 1(f) of this Policy. 

**(d) Unsolicited Information**

  
Sometimes we may be provided with your personal information without having sought it through our normal means of collection.  We refer to this as “unsolicited information”.  Where we collect unsolicited information we will only hold, use and / or disclose that information if we could otherwise do so had we collected it by normal means. If that unsolicited information could not have been collected by normal means then we will destroy, permanently delete or de-identify the information as appropriate.

**(e) How F45 stores information**

Personal information is stored and held in a combination of hard copy and electronic files maintained by F45. 

Personal information is only accessible by officers and employees of F45 (on a need to know basis), unless it is disclosed to another party in accordance with this Policy. 

F45 takes all reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by using industry standard software protection programs. 

**(f) How is personal information used?**

Personal information is used by F45 for the purpose of conducting our business.

Our uses of personal information include, but are not limited to:

  * establishing your identity;
  * managing our relationship with you;
  * assessing suitability of a potential franchisee;
  * creating a personal customer profile;
  * providing you with updates in relation to you promotions, product launches, special events, contests and other activities;
  * engaging with franchisees and customers;
  * conducting and improving our business and services;


  * in the case of employees:
    * to pay your wages and employee entitlements; and
    * to manage your employment relationship with us; 


  * in the case of contractors:
    * to pay your contractors fee; and
    * to manage your contractor relationship with us,


  * complying with our legal obligations, and assisting government and law enforcement agencies and/or regulators;
  * identifying products, services and events that we think may be of interest to you; and
  * communicating with you about the products and services that we offer.



We may also need to collect personal and sensitive information in order to comply with our legal obligations, such as the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing laws, under the _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_ (Cth).

**(g) Direct Marketing**

We may use your personal information to engage in direct marketing activities such as distribution of newsletters, promotional information and advising you about special events and contests. If you do not want to receive emails and/or other communications from us, you can tell us by contacting us as detailed in this Privacy Policy or as detailed in any direct marketing communication that you receive. 

**(h) Sensitive Information**  


We only collect sensitive information reasonably necessary for one or more of the uses specified in Section 1(f) of this Policy if we have the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive information relates, or if the collection is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to life, health or safety or another permitted general situation (as defined in Section 16A of the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth)).

**(i) Disclosure of information**

Personal information may be disclosed to employees and agents of F45, to enable them to provide services to franchisees, customers and others.

It may be necessary for us to disclose your personal information to certain third parties in order to assist us with one or more of our functions or activities, or where permitted or required by law. Third parties may include:

  * entities that are Related Bodies Corporate (as defined in the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth)) to F45;
  * those to whom we outsource certain functions, for example information technology support;
  * auditors and insurers;
  * government and law enforcement agencies and regulators; and
  * entities established to help identify illegal activities and prevent fraud.



We may disclose your personal information from time to time, only if one or more of the following apply:

  * you have consented;
  * you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose your personal information in this way;
  * we are authorised or required to do so by law;
  * disclosure will lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of an individual or to public safety;
  * we are permitted pursuant to Section 16A of the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth); or
  * disclosure is reasonably necessary for a law enforcement related activity.



**(j) Cross-border disclosure of personal information**

F45 does not generally send any personal information to overseas entities. 

We may only transfer personal information to a foreign recipient (including when an overseas entity accesses the information in Australia), if: 

  * we reasonably believe that:
    * the recipient is subject to law, or a binding scheme, that has the effect of protecting the information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar to the APP’s; and
    * there are mechanisms that the individual can access to take action to enforce that protection of the law or binding scheme; or


  * the disclosure is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order; or
  * the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual (from which the information was collected); or
  * the transfer is for the benefit of the individual (and the other APP requirements are met); or
  * if the individual consents to the transfer.



Where disclosure is to be made to a known overseas entity, we will take reasonable steps to assess the privacy laws of the country where information will be disclosed to determine whether the overseas recipient is required to comply with privacy laws that are at least as stringent as the APP requirements in relation to information. We may enter into a written contract with the overseas recipient to enable us to enforce protection of the personal information that we provide to the overseas recipient, and ensure that the overseas entity does breach the APPs.

**(k) Social Media**

There may also be occasions when we collect personal information (to the extent it is available) from publicly available sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. Sometimes, we may provide content and services on a range of platforms (including social media networks) with interactive features to which you may contribute. If you post your personal information in publicly accessible places or social media platforms, your personal information will become publicly available (subject to, where applicable, any privacy settings you have in place in social media platforms). We will not be responsible for the protection of personal information you choose to publish this way.

**(l) Security of information**

F45 will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information F45 holds from any misuse, loss, modification, disclosure or unauthorised access. For example, personal information is retained in secure hard copy and electronic files, and is only accessible by staff on a need to know basis. 

Some of the security measures implemented by us to secure personal information include using firewalls, standard software protection programs, pass word access protections, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.

However, since no system is 100% secure or error-free, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is totally protected, for example, from hackers or misappropriation. You acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You provide information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information where the security of information is not within our control.

**(m) Links to other websites**

Our website may contain links to other websites. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party (including third parties to whom we are permitted to disclose your personal information in accordance with this Policy or any applicable laws). The collection and use of your information by such third party/ies may be subject to separate privacy and security policies.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please contact us immediately using the contact details set out below.

**(n) Information that is no longer required**

If F45 no longer needs the personal information for any purpose for which it may use or disclose the information, and the information does not need to be retained under an Australian law, or court order, F45 will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify the information. 

**2\. Who can I contact for further information, to gain access to my personal information or to make a complaint?**
