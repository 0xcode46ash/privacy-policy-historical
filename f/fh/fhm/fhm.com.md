# Privacy Policy | HOME | FHM.com

We’re aware that privacy and security concerns are a major issue so here’s complete clarity on how we will look after any data you provide to FHM.com.

Our privacy policy is actually remarkably simple: you give us your personal data, we will store it securely and never disclose it to any third parties. And we’re fully compliant with all the legal stuff.

Sometimes, we’ll ask you for some personal information and we do this for a variety of reasons, such as:

  * providing personalised services
  * so we can send out email alerts you may have signed up for
  * so we can send you promotional emails we think you might like
  * to help us improve our services
  * to sell appropriate advertising



You can update your preferences at any time - just login to your account and go to the Settings tab.

So basically, whatever you tell us, we won’t tell anyone unless you say we can. It’s that simple. Please take some time to read through our privacy and cookie policy.

## Privacy & Cookie Policy

  1. Bauer Consumer Media Limited (Bauer) is responsible for the [www.fhm.com](http://www.fhm.com/) website and is committed to protecting your privacy and security.
  2. From time to time we may invite you to supply personal information in order for us to authenticate your identity or to provide you with services. In order to deliver such services, we will need to process and store your personal information and may need to transfer it to the relevant partner(s), to Bauer’s for processing both inside and outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By submitting your personal information, you consent to such processing and transfers in connection with such orders, offers or services and for any other purposes to which you consent at the time you provide the information or as provided in this privacy policy.
  3. Bauer is registered in accordance with and seeks to comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information so as to prevent unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal information to comply with the same. However, the Internet is not a totally secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that Bauer shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of personal data, except to the extent We are required to accept such responsibility by the Data Protection Act 1998.
  4. This Policy only applies to the use that we make of data provided to us via the Internet and email. Other uses may be made of data provided to Bauer in correspondence, by telephone or by other means not detailed in this Policy. These terms apply in addition to [Terms & Conditions Of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) for the website
  5. ### Why We Need To Collect Information From You

We will notify you as to the types of information we are collecting about you as well as the uses we intend to make of that information. We may use the information we collect about you to notify you from time to time about important new features and changes to our online services or special offers, competitions or promotions we think you'll find of interest.
  6. ### Special Promotions

Occasionally a third party may sponsor a promotion, offer, competition or page of the website and you may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. In those circumstances we may wish to provide your personal information to those named third parties. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy policy will apply. You will need to give permission at the time for us to do this.
  7. ### Who Else Will We Provide Your Data To?

In order to provide goods and services e.g. subscriptions to you we may need to provide your data to our agents and service providers. We may provide aggregate statistics about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to our third-party partners (if any), but these statistics will not contain any information about you from which you could be identified.
  8. If you enter any competitions on this website it may be necessary for us to provide your personal information to the promoters of the competition or to others that are involved in the organisation of the competition or the prize-giving. You will be asked for permission at the time.
  9. Also, we may transfer your personal information to purchasers or subsidiaries (and potential purchasers or subsidiaries) if Bauer acquires, or is acquired by or merged with, another company. This will enable you, for example, to continue your relationship with Bauer despite a change of ownership.
  10. ### Content Posted by You

Of course, if you post any personal information to any bulletin boards or forums, this information will immediately be made available to other users throughout the world who may use it to send you unsolicited communications. Furthermore, in some circumstances we may display some of your personal information (name data) when you post material to the website to allow users to identify each other. Also, if you post any content in breach of our Terms & Conditions Of Use we may inform any relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.
  11. ### Security and possibility of international transfer.

Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same level of protection as countries within the EEA, but we always demand that those parties to whom we transfer data adhere to the same security procedures that we follow ourselves. By submitting your personal information, you consent to such processing and transfers in connection with such orders, offers or services and for any other purposes to which you consent at the time you provide the information.
