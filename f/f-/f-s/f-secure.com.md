Where personal data is transferred from North America to outside North America, F-Secure will safeguard the security and integrity of the transferred Personal Data by appropriate means as required by the law. We will do this by imposing appropriate technical and/or contractual safeguards with regard to relevant Subcontractors and F-Secure group companies (e.g. by using data transfer clauses approved by European Union).  

From time to time, we disclose Personal Data to our distribution partners, from whom you have purchased the Services. We will share with these companies only such Personal Data that is necessarily needed by such distribution partners for purposes of undertaking their agreed activities, but not exceeding those listed above in section 4.

We may also disclose your Personal Data to ensure the availability of the Services and the Website according to our rights under the appropriate agreements, license terms or applicable legislation; to protect ourselves against liability or prevent fraudulent activity; or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain. Kindly note that we will take these kind of activities only if and to the extent the applicable law allows.

We may also disclose your Personal Data to effect a corporate transaction, in connection with the possible sale, merger, spin-off, or other corporate reorganization of F-Secure, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in regular course of business. 

We may also disclose your Personal Data to our insurers and to governmental regulatory agencies if and when allowed by applicable laws.

### 6\. Retaining Personal Data

  
We will retain your Personal Data in our databases in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to retain such data.

We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to permit us to pursue available remedies or to limit any damages that we may sustain; to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later; because of agreements between you and us; or if the law requires it.

### 9\. Technical Data

Our Services may also collect technical data related to your use of the Services. This is separate from data associated with your use of the Services and associated to the Personal Data collected.
