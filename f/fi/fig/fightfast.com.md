**There is a nasty fighter hiding inside you… and we know how to wake him up and _make him a part of you_...fast and without hassle.**

---|---|---  
  |  **Listen to what these experts have to say:**

"There's no flare, no garbage, no ceremonial nonsense, no magic. Paul can spend 15 minutes with anyone and make you twice the fighter you were before!" - Shane Brott, Black Belt Martial Arts Instructor  
"Finally, after 23 years of karate and other martial art styles (including military training), I found a system that works in the real world! Paul, where were you 20 years ago?"  
**\- Paul Iwamoto, Chicago**

"Thanks for a video that the ordinary person who works for a living can actually learn from! I am passing these simple and effective tools along to my wife and children." - Rick Manente, Los Angeles  
"Street Safe is the most effective self defense system I have ever come across."  
\- **CA Narcotics Task Force Commander** , (Name withheld due to security regulations.)

"This (Street Safe) will probably turn the Martial Arts community on its ear... BRAVO Paul."  
\- Jim Hinesly, SWAT Team Member, Hostage Negotiator, and member of Sheriff's Tactical Team.

Actual SEAL team members are not allowed (by strict Navy regulations) to comment, but in private conversations with me they have said that Paul Vunak's training system has provided them with the most realistic training they've ever had, going back 20 years!

"Paul has one advantage nobody else has-actual experience in street fighting. Having been in it, he can teach you how to not only survive, but win, even if you aren't experienced in the street."  
**\- Rich Chen** , Hawaiian ex-street-fighter

"Listen: Any citizen who leaves the safety of themselves or their family in the hands of any organization, including your local police department, is in for trouble! We all need to take responsibility for our own well being. I feel this video tape will give anybody who watches it immediate tools in self defense principles that will make you confident. And anyone from the age of 13 to 80 can use these tools!"  
**\- Sgt. Carlos Hernandes** , South Florida Police Tactics Instructor 

**This is what our  
customers say**

**Simple, Effective, Will Work!,** "The techniques presented are very simple and effective. As stated in the video, you won't need alot of time learning, and so simple that it should work in an emergency. You do need to practice initially as stated in the video. Don't just watch and expect it to work. Practice untill you learn it then minimal maintenance is required. Could save your life! Only wish I could find a willing partner as in the video to practice with..."

**You really could take down someone twice your size**  
"If you are after very basic self defence and thats all, you can't go far wrong with this video. This video does not contain armed forces unarmed combat as such. A few of the moves look similar to others I have studied. I feel that this video is a bit too concerned with what to do then run away. I know taking your self out of harms way is what should be done, but there is nothing on blocking attacks or punching. I would recomend this video to women (thats not being sexist by the way, you will understand the practical aplications if you see the video) and people with fears about walking dark streets etc. For people that want a bit more of a traditional fighting without running away you should check out some of Pauls other stuff. It is really amazing.  
I think I would be wrong to dismiss this info, when it is instinctive it is a brilliant form of defence.   
If you need extra confidence on the street you will like this video.  
This is in addition to what I wrote previously. I dont think I gave this video time to sink in before reviewing it. Now after practicing the moves for a while I had a chance to put them into practice. Even after a few drinks the moves were imprinted on my brain and instanteneous... "

**THIS FIGHTING SYSTEM IS TRULY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

"If you want to Defend Yourself, Buy This tape NOW. You will love it. The moves are incredible and extremely simple. Now I know why the navy seals are the world's greatest fighters!!!! EVERYONE MUST HAVE IT!!!!!"

"Our guys love it because they don't have to spend thousands of hours on the mat training. The principals are simplistic and realistic. "

"I would absolutely without hesistation recommend Paul and his system to anyone!"

"This is a fighting system! Paul Vunak's system is functional fighting; it is clean, simkple and will make you a better fighting very, very fast!"

"On behalf of the Healeah Police Department, I would like to commend Paul for his contribution of outstanding self defense training. A job well done!"

"Finally the SEALS no longer will be doing reverse punches and flying side kicks while carrying ruc sacks and machine guns. Thanks Paul!"

**Good simplification of Lee's JKD**

"Mr. Vunak is a highly respected hand-to-hand combat instructor and martial arts "guro".Vunak was once the leading student of the great Dan Inosanto,Bruce Lee's protege.After going off on his own,Vunak became a student of Brazilian Jujitsu under Rorion Gracie.I believe that Vunak was the first Jeet Kune Do Concepts instructor to recognize the value of Brazilian grappling.This was long before Royce Gracie shocked the martial arts world by easily winning the first ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP in 1993.  
The video is unique in its teaching format and the techniques are servicable. One minor criticism of the tape is the emphasis on the Filipino "gunting" (limb destruction) entry.The gunting makes sense with a blade ot a stick.It is hard to work with bare hands,unless someone insists on running and arm or leg into your knee or elbow.I think a destruction is okay to take if it comes,but it is not something one should look for.  
The section on the use of knees,elbows,and headbutts is brutal,and definitely not for the kiddies. Overall,I rate Mr. Vunak very highly as a credible source of knowledge in the area of realistic self-defense"

**Awesome!**  
"I'm so impressed by this video that I'll attempt to make arrangements for personal training from Paul Vunak. "

**The shortcut to effective fighting ability**  
"You need to be able to defend yourself in a hurry? You need it for real life? You have no training partner and very little time?  
BUY THIS VIDEO!! These are hard hitting, effective fighting moves designed to overcome your attacker in the blink of an eye. No there are not thousand techniques to counter any move an attacker might make, that's impossible but it contains a small series of moves (the R.A.T System) designed to fit most. And as a bonus you get interactive training sessions with Paul Vunak. The crux of it? You need a vicious, aggressive attitude to make the system work."
