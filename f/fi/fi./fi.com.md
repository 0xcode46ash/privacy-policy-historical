# Fisher Investments - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

##### Last Revised: April 12, 2004

##### _Our commitment to you: User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be sold to any third party._

If you have any questions concerning Fisher Investment's Privacy Policy, please send us an email to [privacy@fi.com](mailto:privacy@fi.com). We'll be glad to help!

##### Introduction

Fisher Investments, Inc. provides investment management services to over 10,000 high net worth clients worldwide. As a world-class organization, we are committed to providing the highest quality of service to all of our customers. We also have a responsibility to our customers, the public, and our profession to deliver our services in a professional manner, with uncompromising values and standards. As such, the firm must and will in all respects comply with all relevant Federal and State laws, regulations and requirements.

Fisher Investments is committed to providing you with a clear explanation of its Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers privacy issues as they relate to US, Canada, and UK online marketing initiatives and www.fi.com, www.fi-canada.com, www.fisherinvestments.co.uk, pcg.fisherinvestments.com, www.fi-inst.com, and all respective subdirectories.

##### Email

Fisher Investments always likes to hear from our valued clients and prospective clients, and we collect the email addresses of users who communicate with us via email or request information via our website. Fisher Investments collects email addresses and other data collected online from current and prospective clients so that we can provide them with the information they've requested, whether from Fisher Investments or from one of our marketing partners.

In certain instances, Fisher Investments uses the services of partner companies who may help us reach prospective clients by collecting email addresses. Please note that these addresses come from people who _specifically request information on Fisher Investments via clearly labeled online advertising_.

Fisher Investments collects online data from prospective employees via our website. You can be assured that resumes and personal information submitted to us will be held confidential and will not be shared with any third parties.

Fisher Investments also sponsors third party email content. In order to receive Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, you would have had to previously subscribed to a particular service or "opted-in" to receive relevant promotional content from advertising partners. As advertisers, we do not gain access to users' contact information—this information is kept confidential—nor does Fisher Investments supply additional users from our own internal database. Rather, the respective online publisher distributes content on our behalf.

If you have received Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, you must unsubscribe or "opt-out" through the respective publisher. The only way to avoid receiving promotional offers like these in the future (from Fisher Investments or other companies) is by going directly to the respective publisher and unsubscribing from their list.

Fisher Investments does, however, maintain a suppression file of email addresses in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (S.877). This list is updated daily and provided to publishers with instructions to exclude the respective email addresses from sponsored email campaigns. For instructions on adding your name to Fisher Investments' email suppression file, see the section called "Removal from the Fisher Investments Database."

##### Online Advertising

Fisher Investments' advertising is in full compliance with Internet, advertising and finance industry standards and regulations. Our advertising content is integrated and delivered with online publisher's primary content in a variety of different formats; some ads are embedded in the website (e.g. banner) while others are delivered by an independent browser window (e.g. pop-up). 

The delivery of our pop-up and pop-under ads (and frequency thereof) is ultimately controlled by the respective online publisher. Unfortunately, we are unable to restrict the delivery of our popup advertisements to individual users. Typically, pop-ups are "frequency capped" so users should only receive one pop-up ad per site session (based on the respective publisher's ad serving policy). However, this functionality will NOT work if you have disabled "cookies" in your browser. If you are experiencing a high volume of popup ads, then it might be an issue with your Internet browser's ability to accept "cookies". It is important that you have "cookies" enabled in your browser settings. 

The information we collect through online advertising is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. To best serve users with offers that are of relevance, Fisher Investments has formed relationships with companies that place ads on third party publishers' websites. In addition, these companies may track advertising that are placed within certain email newsletters. As a result of users visiting its website, ad server companies may collect information about users such as domain type, IP address, and clickstream data. _Please note that this information is not individually identifiable_.

Fisher Investments uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner. These files enable the ad serving system to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who also works with our ad management partner. 

With cookies, the information we collect is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

##### Cookies

What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a link that a user clicked on, which is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. They do not contain user passwords. The individual information gathered in this manner is used for internal purposes only, such as customizing content. We also use the information on an aggregate basis, to track the usage of our website and to analyze traffic patterns. 

You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies provide benefits like streamlining the website so visitors can find the information they are looking for more easily, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

##### Partners

Certain partner organizations review aggregate cookie and email data in order to help Fisher Investments get a better understanding of the users visiting its website. _These companies do NOT have access to individual user information_. The cumulative data they maintain for Fisher Investments is expressly NOT SHARED with other organizations for commercial purposes. User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be sold to any third party.

##### General Privacy Notice for Fisher Investments' Clients

Fisher Investments may also disclose that information to unaffiliated third parties (such as to brokers or custodians) only as permitted by law and only as needed for Fisher Investments to provide agreed services to clients. Fisher Investments maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard nonpublic personal information.

##### Privacy Policy Updates

From time to time, Fisher Investments may use data for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If its information practices change at some time in the future Fisher Investments will post the policy changes to its website to notify users of these changes and provide the ability to "opt-out" or unsubscribe from these new uses. If users are concerned about how information is used, they should check back to this location periodically.
