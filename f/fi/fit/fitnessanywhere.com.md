# Privacy Policy

Fitness Anywhere, LLC ("Fitness Anywhere") respects your privacy, and is committed to reasonable measures to safeguard personally identifying information you may share with us.

Fitness Anywhere's Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as "The Policy") is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when providing personally identifying information to Fitness Anywhere as a visitor or registered user at [www.trxtraining.com](http://www.trxtraining.com/).

If you have questions or concerns regarding The Policy, you should first contact us at [privacy@trxtraining.com](mailto:privacy@trxtraining.com).

###  What Information Do We Collect?

We only have access to collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We are the sole owners of the information collected on [www.trxtraining.com](http://www.trxtraining.com/). We will not sell or rent this information to anyone other than as permitted by The Policy, or specifically authorized by you.

If you choose to register with us and create a user profile you are required to enter your name, email, and create a password. Additionally, you have the option of providing us with birthday, gender, creating a screen name, or storing your billing payment information as well as shipping address.

Guest users are only required to provide as much information as is reasonably necessary to complete any transaction for which they have initiated, including an email address, billing, and shipping information. However, unlike a registered user who may opt to have billing and shipping information stored, guest users billing and shipping information will not be stored and will only be used for purposes of completing the transaction for which it was provided.

We will be using browser session data to store your shopping cart as well as your session while you browse the site. Your data will be stored only for that browser session. However, if you have logged in as registered user, then your activities will be saved by browser session and stored on the server with a session ID.

Like many companies, we monitor the use of the website by collecting aggregate information. No personally identifiable data are collected in this process. Typically, such information comprises customer demographics, traffic patterns, sales, and site usage. This information is used for our commercial purposes, including to improve usability, performance and effectiveness of the website.

In some instances, we may collect aggregate data through cookies and similar files. The majority of web browsers accept cookies and similar files, but you can usually change the browser settings to prevent this. However, if you do so, some functionality of [www.trxtraining.com](http://www.trxtraining.com/) may be impaired or lost, particularly any site customization features.

Our website may provide links to third-party websites that are outside of our control and not covered by The Policy, e.g. [Facebook®](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/) and [Twitter®](http://twitter.com/privacy). We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites to learn about those sites policies and practices with respect to your personally identifying information.

Any improper collection or misuse of personally information provided to Fitness Anywhere may be a violation of The Policy and should be reported to [privacy@trxtraining.com](mailto:privacy@trxtraining.com).

###  How is the information obtained by Fitness Anywhere used?

We may share your personally identifiable information with authorized third-parties agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company.

Any comments, statuses, updates, +1, tweets, etc that you voluntarily share on a Fitness Anywhere social media page may appear on [www.trxtraining.com](http://www.trxtraining.com/) in the scrolling bar that shows activity on our pages or profiles.

We may collect and share personally identifiable information when we have a good faith belief that access, use, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, rule, regulation, or enforceable governmental or administrative request, enforce our applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations, detect, prevent, or address fraud, security or technical issues, or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Fitness Anywhere, our users or the public.

Our use of information other than for the purpose of completing a requested transaction or service is on an opt-in basis. This means that you will not receive communications from us regarding, for example, specials, new products or new services, unless you have given us affirmative permission to receive such communications.

###  How are the Privacy Rights of younger users treated?

###  How your information may be shared with advertisers or other Third Parties?

We provide such information to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies who may render services with us or on our behalf. We may also provide such information to other trusted business partners of ours who process information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with The Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may share non-personal, aggregate information regarding customer demographics, traffic patterns, sales, and site usage with our partners, advertisers or sponsors.

Similarly, we may provide access to third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through our website.

###  What is Fitness Anywhere's Security?

We store your personal data on a secure server that is password protected and shielded from the outside world by a firewall. We have in place policies that are intended to ensure, as far as possible, the security and integrity of all our information, including your personally identifying information. However, no system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you provide to us and, accordingly, you do so at your own risk.

Whenever we collect particularly sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.
