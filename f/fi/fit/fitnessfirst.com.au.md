** At Fitness First your privacy has always been important to us. We are currently going through our policies and procedures that effect the way we store, collect and use information to make sure that we comply with the National Privacy Principles (new privacy laws which apply from 21 December 2001).  
This privacy policy explains how we collect personal information and how we maintain, use and disclose that information. It also provides some detail about your privacy rights along with our general rights and obligations and our policy in relation to the personal information we keep on record.  
When you become a member, the application form includes notices about privacy and requests for consent. This privacy notice (called Customer Direct Debit Service Agreement and Privacy Statement and Acknowledgement) specifies in more detail how any information about you may be used and disclosed in relation to your membership.  
**What information does Fitness First hold?  
** The types of information we ask for are standard from club to club. We keep records of one or more of the following types of information about you:

If we do have to collect sensitive information, we will do so in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.  
 **How Fitness First collects your information  
** Generally, we only collect personal information about you from you, unless it is not reasonable or practical for us to do so or you consent. This information is usually collected upon becoming a member of Fitness First or over the reception counter via member information change forms.  
 **What rights does Fitness First have to disclose personal information?  
** Fitness First does not disclose any of the information collected from its members except for credit agencies (in the case of financial information) and our staff/personal trainers (in the case of health information)  
Sometimes the law requires or allows us to give out information about you. For example, by giving your account details to a court if we are ordered to do so under a subpoena.  
We will not disclose your health information or information about your medical history unless you tell us to.  
 **Access to your information  
** You can request access to personal information we hold about you by completing the required forms at your home club's reception. We will process your request within a reasonable time, usually 14 working days for a straightforward request. More time may be needed, depending on the nature of the request. There is no fee for requesting access to your information.  
 **Correction of information  
** We try to ensure that all information we hold about you which we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. You must promptly notify us if there are any changes to your personal information by filling the appropriate forms at your home club's reception.

According to RSA Labs, it would take a trillion-trillion years to crack using today's technology.' eSign.com.au

These new rules are set out in a framework of The Ten National Privacy principals.

 **Collection of personal information**

Under the privacy rules, we must:   


  * _Only collect information that is necessary for our activities;_  

  * _Collect information in a fair and lawful way; and_   


As far as is practical, collect information directly from the individual.

**6.** We will use or disclose information about you in ways that are consistent with your expectations and our privacy statement or are required in the public interest.  
**7.** We will ensure that information about you is accurate when we collect or use it.

**9.** We will be open with you about what kind of personal information we hold and what we do with it.  
**10.** Wherever possible we will let you see the information we hold about you and correct it if it is wrong.  
**11.** We will limit our use of identifiers that government agencies have assigned to you.

**13.** We will take steps to protect your privacy if we send personal information about you to a third party.  
**14.** We will limit the collection of highly sensitive information about you.
