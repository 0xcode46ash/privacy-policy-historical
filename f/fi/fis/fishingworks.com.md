# FishingWorks.com - Helping Fishermen Navigate the Web

  
As a neutral intermediary, our primary product to our users and members is TRUST. Following is a statement of our privacy policies.

**_Information Collection and Use_**  
FishingWorks.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We will never share any personally identifiable information from website users unless permission for the dissemination of such information is voluntarily given by a user.

**_Anonymous Information_**  
Anonymous clickstream information is collected for every visitor to this site. This includes pages viewed, date and time and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases geographic region. There is no association between this information and a visitor's identity.

**_Registration_**  
In order to use the personalized resources of this website, a user must first complete the registration form to become a member of FishingWorks.com. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information or unique identifiers (such as address), but is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**_Cookies_**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. The cookies extract no personal information or provide us with a method to identify or contact you. Once the user closes his/her browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be ablae to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, or receive our Newsletter, that take place from time to time. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

**_Log Files_**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**_Sharing_**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These partners are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. FishingWorks.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to [privacy@FishingWorks.com](mailto:privacy@FishingWorks.com). (If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message from each e-mail account you use.) Also, FishingWorks.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. FishingWorks.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of FishingWorks.com, our users, or others.

**_Links_**  
This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that FishingWorks.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. Our privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

**_Surveys and Contests_**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys, contests or sweepstakes and other give-aways. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as age and household income). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used only for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**_Tell-A-Friend_**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact us at [privacy@FishingWorks.com](mailto:privacy@FishingWorks.com) to request the removal of this information from our database.

**_Security_**  
This Website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

Whenever we ask users to enter sensitive personal information (such as address and/or credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing".

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable informotion on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to [privacy@FishingWorks.com](mailto:privacy@FishingWorks.com).

In order for our FishingWorks to enhance its ability to tailor its website to an individual's preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from one of these companies, it collects and shares that purchase information with us so we can better tailor our site to each user's preferences.

**_Special Offers_**  
We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we clearly present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**_Site and Service Updates_**  
We also send the user site and service announcements and updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service, unless they cancel their FishingWorks membership. We communicate with the user to provide requested services with respect to issues relating to their membership via e-mail, postal service or phone.

**_Correction/Updating Personal Information_**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our personalized services, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by e-mailing our Customer Support at [support@FishingWorks.com](mailto:support@FishingWorks.com). 

**_Choice/Opt-out_**  
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail or e-mail us at [support@FishingWorks.com](mailto:support@FishingWorks.com).

**_Consent and Notification of Changes_**  
By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FishingWorks.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

Any questions or comments about our Privacy Policy should be sent by e-mail to [privacy@FishingWorks.com](mailto:privacy@FishingWorks.com).
