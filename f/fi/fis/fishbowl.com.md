## Information Collection and Use

##### Registration for Fishbowl Client Customers

In order receive emails sent by Fishbowl on behalf of its clients; you must first complete a signup form (a) in a participating store, (b) at an event, (c) by dropping your business card in a fishbowl or basket or other collection device that states you are choosing to join the client’s email list, or (d) by registering online through its web site. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as first and last name, month and day of birth, and email address). The client provides this registration information to us. Fishbowl collects personally identifiable information from our users during the initial signup process as well as during surveys or preference requests. We use this information to contact you with offers, newsletters and special promotions which you have expressed interest in receiving.

You may also be given the opportunity to provide your cell phone number during the sign-up process or through a separate email from a Fishbowl client. By providing your cell phone number, you are agreeing to receive text (SMS) messages on your cell phone. You have the option to provide demographic information (such as gender and zip code) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience. If you elect not to provide such demographic information, you may still participate in the client’s program offerings.

Communications may include offers, newsletters, updates, special promotions, surveys and unsubscribe confirmations.

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, Fishbowl requires all children under age thirteen (13) to obtain parental consent to join any of our lists. All terms of our privacy policy apply to children under 13.

##### Uses of Customer Information

Fishbowl will not send unsolicited, bulk or commercial offers or advertisements. Fishbowl will NOT rent, sell, trade or loan our clients’ lists to anyone. All emails contain links on how to unsubscribe from the client list. All SMS messages contain information on how to unsubscribe from the client list.

Fishbowl will use personally identifiable information to contact you when responding to email support requests and other direct requests for information from Fishbowl.

##### Surveys or Contests

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in web-based contests or surveys. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name address and phone number(s)), demographic information (such as zip code) and personal preference information (such as your opinions). This information is used by our clients to better understand their customers.

Fishbowl may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with any third party except with the client unless we give you prior notice and you elect to permit the provision of that information to the third party.

##### Forward to a Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about an email club to which you subscribe, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. This process will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to join the client email list. Fishbowl stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program, after which the names collected are removed from the database.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Fishbowl only shares your data with the client from which you have requested to receive offers. We do not provide the client with your personally identifiable data; however, we do share reports about your statistics and information about your preferences.

##### Service Providers

When you sign up for an email club, we will share your enrollment information with our data entry company so that the third party can provide the service.
