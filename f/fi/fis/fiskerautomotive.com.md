# Privacy Policy | Karma

### Introduction

Karma Automotive LLC (“Karma”) knows that you are concerned about privacy and the security of your Personal Information. It’s our policy to respect the privacy of our customers and to protect their information. We also want you to know how we use and protect the information we receive from and about you. To that end, please read the Privacy Policy below. 

### Collection, Use, and Sharing of Personal Information

In certain circumstances, Karma may collect and use your Personal Information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is defined as information that can be used to contact or identify you, including your name, home and business mailing addresses, telephone number, e-mail address, payment card, direct debit or other billing information, social media account information, driver’s license number, tax identification number, government-issued identification number, and date of birth. (In adopting this definition of Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, Karma does not concede that all of this information amounts to “Personally Identifiable Information” as that term is defined under state and federal law.) Personal Information may be collected from you in a variety of ways: 

  * We may collect Personal Information through our Web site, social media pages, e-mail, or other digital services or platforms.
  * We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases and marketing partnerships.
  * We may collect your Personal Information when you visit an Karma store or repair facility, attend a tradeshow, sign up for a test drive, place an order over the phone, or contact our customer services or sales departments.



We are committed to protecting the Personal Information of our customers and visitors with the same care that we use for all Karma company transactions. Accordingly, your Personal Information will only be accessible to individuals at Karma who need to access that information to perform their jobs. Karma uses Personal Information to: 

  * Respond to inquiries and fulfill requests made online, in person, or over the phone.
  * Complete purchases.
  * Provide customer service.
  * Advise you of safety-related information.
  * Advise you of changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
  * Present you with products and offers tailored to your interests (consistent with your expressed preferences).



We do not share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes unless you opt in to that sharing. However, Personal Information we collect may be disclosed to third parties when necessary to perform services on our or on your behalf. Karma also may disclose Personal Information to third parties to comply with subpoenas or other legal obligations. Karma reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to share Personal Information to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable. 

### Collection, Use, and Sharing of Other Information

Karma may also collect and share information that cannot, on its own, be used to identify you. Our servers may automatically collect and store certain technical information when you visit or use our Web sites, mobile device-enabled Web sites or downloaded mobile applications (collectively referred to as “Sites”), including information such as the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the device you use to connect to the Internet, browser type, device type, mobile device ID (“UDID”), screen size and resolution, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), the Site you came from and exited to, operating system, date/time stamp, and pages visited. If you give us your current physical location, for example, when you visit or use our Sites or enter your current address or ZIP code on our Sites, we may use and store that information to provide you with location-based information or messaging. If you do not want to give us your location, do not enter your current location on our Sites and do not allow your browser or mobile device to send it to us. Karma or its third-party service providers may place and read data stored (via session and/or persistent “cookies” or other device specific storage capabilities) on the device you are using. Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device for a variety of purposes, including to identify your device and/or your account when you return to a Karma Site. You can generally remove, block, or disable cookies by using the settings located in your browser. If you decide to remove or not accept cookies, some features and services on our Sites may not work properly and the offers we provide when you visit or use our Sites may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. Karma may also use other technologies, such as Web beacons, clear GIFs, tracking pixels and tags, when you visit or use our Sites or open an e-mail from Karma. To the extent permitted by applicable law, third parties, including our service providers, may collect information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites, including when you visit our Sites. Karma and its third party service providers may use information from our server logs, cookies and other technologies, in combination with information you provide, transaction information, and information that we or they collect from others, to develop, offer, deliver and improve our products and services, to offer products and services of our affiliates, marketing partners and other companies, to process your transactions, to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements, and as otherwise permitted by applicable law. For example, we may use the information to: 

  * Operate Karma Sites.
  * Deliver products and services to people who use our Sites.
  * Understand how visitors use our Sites, assist us with resolving visitors’ questions regarding the use of our Sites, and determine whether the content on our Sites is effective.
  * Improve our Sites and service offerings.
  * Personalize your experience on the Sites and customize the communications and advertisements you receive from us, our affiliates and others.
  * Deliver online and offline advertisements and other information about products or services offered by Karma, our affiliates, and others.
  * Let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients to understand the effectiveness of our marketing and other communications and to make those communications more useful and interesting to you.



### Links

The Karma Sites may contain hyperlinks to third party Web sites. Karma is not responsible for the content, privacy, or practices of those Web sites and this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. The inclusion of a link on a Karma Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates, nor does it imply an affiliation with the third party. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, or wireless service provider, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our software applications or social media pages. 

### Additional Information

Unless prohibited by law, you have the right, upon reasonable notice, to view any Personal Information collected from you through your visits to or use of our Sites, to make corrections to such information if necessary, or to request that such information be removed from our systems. You may do so by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this Privacy Policy. We do not intend to collect Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected this information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly take all reasonable steps to delete the data from our system. We will retain your Personal Information only for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. 

### Updates to this Policy

From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy currently in effect and published here replaces all prior privacy policies posted by Karma on the Sites. You can see when this policy was last revised by scrolling to the bottom of the page. By using the Sites or otherwise providing Personal Information to us following the most recent revision, you accept the terms of the current Privacy Policy. Customers who access financial products and services electronically and have agreed to receive notices at the Sites, should periodically check for changes to this Privacy Policy, which will be continuously posted in a clear and conspicuous manner.
