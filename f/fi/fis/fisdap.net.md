FISDAP Privacy Policy

What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how FISDAP treats personally identifiable information that FISDAP  
collects and receives. Personally identifiable information is information about you  
that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone  
number, student field and clinical experience data that can be tied to such students'  
name or other personal information, and that is not otherwise publicly available.  
This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that FISDAP does  
not own or control, or to people that FISDAP does not employ or manage.

Information Collection and Use

FISDAP collects personally identifiable information when you create your account,  
when you use FISDAP products or services, or when you visit FISDAP pages. When you  
register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address, birth date,  
gender, zip code, phone number, and graduation date. Once you register with FISDAP and  
sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. FISDAP collects the data students  
enter about their experience during field and clinical internships, and during testing.  
FISDAP automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,  
including your IP address and the page you request. FISDAP uses that information for the  
following general purposes: to provide information about the students' experience to the  
student, their instructors and the school staff, to improve our services, to contact you  
and to conduct research. FISDAP uses non-identifiable content from students field and  
clinical experience and testing results in its general business operations, such as  
research and providing anonymous reporting for other students, researcher and educators.

FISDAP does not rent or sell any personally identifiable information.

Students have the right to withhold their data from being used by us for our general  
business purposes, including for research. When any student account is created, the students  
are given a chance to decide if they want to grant consent for their data to be used in  
such a way or not.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our  
legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share  
information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal  
activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical  
safety of any person, violations of FISDAP's User Agreement, or as otherwise required  
by law. We will transfer information about you if FISDAP is acquired by or merged with  
another company to the acquiring company.

Cookies

FISDAP only uses session cookies that get deleted at the end of each session.

Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences

Students and their Instructors can edit their FISDAP Account Information at any  
time by going to the Admin section of the web site and clicking on the Account tab. At any  
time before their graduation dates, students can edit field and clinical data until they  
mark a given shift as complete. Instructors can view and edit their students' field and  
clinical data at any time.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the FISDAP service,  
such as service announcements, administrative messages, late data entry reminders, and  
other messages that are considered part of your FISDAP account, without offering you  
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

We limit access to personally identifiable information about you to employees, who we  
believe reasonably need that information to provide products or services to you or in order  
to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with  
federal regulations to protect personal information about you. Your FISDAP Account Information  
is password-protected. It is the user's responsibility to protect the security of their password.  
Passwords are stored in the database in an encrypted format, so we do not have access to your password.  
In certain areas FISDAP uses encryption to protect data transmissions. We do not control school or  
instructor access to the students' personal information. The school sets up access to the students'  
account as it deems appropriate.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

FISDAP may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we  
treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in  
your FISDAP account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
