FISDAP Privacy Policy

What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how FISDAP treats personally identifiable information that FISDAP collects and receives. Personally identifiable information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, location, student field and clinical experience data that can be tied to such student’s name or other personal information that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that FISDAP does not own or control, or to people that FISDAP does not employ or manage. We also may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your identifiable personal information.

Information Collection and Use

FISDAP collects personally identifiable information when you create your account, when you use FISDAP products or services, or when you visit FISDAP pages. When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, phone number, and graduation date. Once you register with FISDAP and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. FISDAP collects the data students enter about their experience during field and clinical internships, and during testing. FISDAP automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and the page you request. FISDAP uses that information for the following general purposes: to provide information about the student’s experience to the student, their instructors, clinical sites to which you have access, and the school staff, to improve our services, to contact you and to conduct research. FISDAP uses non-identifiable content from students’ field and clinical experience and testing results in its general business operations, such as research and providing anonymous reporting for other students, researcher and educators.

FISDAP does not rent, or sell any personally identifiable information.

Students have the right to withhold their data from being used by us for our general business purposes, including for research. When any student account is created, the students are given a chance to decide if they want to grant consent for their data to be used in such a way or not.

Except as otherwise provided in the Privacy Policy, we will keep your personally identifiable information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) enforce our User Agreement; or (d) provide our services to you with assistance of third-parties we engage to provide services to you. We will transfer information about you if FISDAP is acquired by or merged with another company to the acquiring company.

Cookies

FISDAP only uses session cookies that get deleted at the end of each session.

Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences

Students and their Instructors can edit their FISDAP Account Information at any time by going to the Admin section of the web site and clicking on the Account tab. At any time before their graduation dates, students can edit field and clinical data until they mark a given shift as complete. Instructors can view and edit their students’ field and clinical data at any time.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the FISDAP service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, late data entry reminders, and other messages that are considered part of your FISDAP account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

We limit access to personally identifiable information about you to employees, who we believe reasonably need that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that protect personal information about you. Your FISDAP Account Information is password-protected. It is the user’s responsibility to protect the security of their password. Passwords are stored in the database in an encrypted format, so we do not have access to your password. In certain areas FISDAP uses encryption to protect data transmissions. We do not control school or instructor access to the student’s personal information. The school sets up access to the students’ account as it deems appropriate.

Lost or Stolen Information

You must promptly notify us if your user name, token or mobile device is lost, stolen or used without permission. In such event we will change your tokenpassword and send your new token to the email address we have on record for your account.
