# Reginet.com: Privacy

**Privacy**

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how REGINET.com collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our web site. 

**Information Collection**  
When you browse REGINET.com's web site, you do so anonymously. We don't collect personal information - including your e-mail address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. 

At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, such as your e-mail address and postal address, for purposes such as corresponding with us, making a purchase, or entering a sweepstakes. When you enter a sweepstakes with REGINET.com, for example, we collect the serial number and your name, address, and e-mail address. Like many other commercial web sites, the REGINET.com's web site may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please read About Cookies for more information. 

**Information Use**  
If you provide us with your e-mail or postal address, or have done so in the past, we will ask you if we can use it to send you updates on the latest REGINET.com's products and promotions. We may use information you have given to us, for example, to provide a service, and inform you about new products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us or in surveys. 

**Declining E-mail Offers**  
REGINET.com provides customers with an easy means to decline to receive e-mail offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the e-mail and informing us of your preferences. All e-mail offers that you receive from REGINET.com will tell you how to decline further e-mail offers.

While REGINET.com's product ad campaigns and marketing materials are often viewed by children, we do not solicit data from them. REGINET.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, REGINET.com's web site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Your Acceptance of These Terms By using this site, you signify your assent to the REGINET.com Customer Internet Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
