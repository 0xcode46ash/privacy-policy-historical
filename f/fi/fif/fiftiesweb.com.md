# Fifties Website Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY OF FIFTIES WEB  
---  
**Visitors:** I do not collect or distribute my visitors' personal information. Your name, address, phone number, etc, all remain private. If you email me a question or comment, the only person you're gonna hear back from - is me! I hate spam as much as the next person and wouldn't dream of inflicting it on another living soul.  
**Tell a Friend:** The form to recommend this site to a friend is private between you and your friends. I really hope that you will use it, but know that I won't be mailing your friend, nor will anyone else.  
**Still...** Sometimes this site may have a message or bulletin board. Anything you post on there is visible to the general public. Think twice before posting any personal information (ex. phone number, home address, real name). This is a good rule to follow all over the Internet.
