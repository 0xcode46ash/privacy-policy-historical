• Our employees are responsible for protection of customer information. We have internal policies and programs
designed to protect your information. It is the responsibility of each Fieldglass employee to comply with our
privacy policies and procedures.
• We provide security safeguards to protect customer information. Multiple security layers including sensor and
host based intrusion detection along with firewalls protects all customer data. All customer data that is taken off
site uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and a digital signature. AES is a state-of-the-art encryption
standard developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with industry experts and

does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others without your prior consent. To opt to not have

partners and customers non-personal, aggregate statistical information regarding you, your customers, your
suppliers, sales, traffic patterns and site usage.
II. The Information We Collect We rely on many sources of information to help us understand and meet
your needs. On occasion, we enter into agreements with other companies to provide services to us or to make
additional products and services available to you. We carefully stipulate under these agreements that these
companies may receive nonpublic personal information about you, and that they must protect this information
and may not use it for any other purpose other than in connection with our agreement. We may collect nonpublic
personal information about you including:
• Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties;
• Information we receive about you from applications and other forms, which we have collected by your using
products or services obtained from us, one of our affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties; and
• Information we receive from other sources, such as your employer and other third parties.
III. Why We Collect Information? Fieldglass uses nonpublic personal information about you to:
• Accurately identify you;
• Protect and administer your records and accounts;
• Help us notify you of product enhancements and changes to products;
• Save you time when you apply for additional products and services;
• Comply with certain laws and regulations.
IV. How We Collect Your Information? Fieldglass collects information related to you in several ways:
• Some personal information is gathered when you register. The more information you volunteer (and the more
accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience.
• In addition to the above, we may also ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited
to) when you enroll in a program offered by one of our partners, when you alter your request for services (i.e.,
increase your annual spend) and when you report a problem with our software or one of our services. If you
contact Fieldglass we may keep a record of that correspondence. Fieldglass may also occasionally ask you to


complete surveys that we use for research purposes.
V. How is the Collected Information Used?
• We also monitor usage to help us develop upgrades to the software and develop the design and layout of the
website.
• We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes,
and special offers we think you’ll find valuable.
• Fieldglass collects, stores and uses information from the users of its application (meaning the computer
software programs), and the hosted environment (meaning a hardware/software system combination under the
control of Fieldglass on which the Product, or any portion thereof, is run). Aggregated versions of this information
(information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
information about your usage patterns, with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance the
application or hosted environment and our services. Additionally, Fieldglass may keep track of this information
and the information that you provide to us for our internal review, business development, research, marketing
and promotional purposes, press inquiries or aggregate statistical analysis, customization, demographic patterns,
and historical trends. Aggregate information may occasionally be shared with our business partners and
customers, and this information does not include any personally identifiable information about you or allow
anyone to identify you individually. As Fieldglass adopts additional technology we may also gather information
through other means.
VI. Information Security We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those who need
to have that information to provide products or services to you. If we use other companies to provide products
or services to you, we require that they keep the information we share with them safe and secure. We have
physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place that comply with legal requirements to store and secure
information about you from unauthorized access, alteration and destruction.
VII. Consent By using the Fieldglass application, you consent to the collection and use of this information by
Fieldglass. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in this document so that you are
always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
Fieldglass reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter or update these policies, and you agree to be bound by
such modifications, alterations, or updates. These Privacy Principles are effective as of June 26, 2002 and may
be modified from time to time. In the event you have any inquiries or complaints regarding these privacy matters,
please contact us at 312.279.8700.
