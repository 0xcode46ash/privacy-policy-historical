We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required so by law.

     To enable us to personalize content, advertising and promotions based on preferences, needs, suggestions, or recommendations.   
     To provide advance notice of termination of a trial period or an opportunity to extend a trial period, or advance notice of expiration of your software license. 

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms of use (for example protect our intellectual property rights), and your compliance with the applicable End User License Agreement(s) contained within the RegCure software.
