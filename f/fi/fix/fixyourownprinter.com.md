### Privacy Statement

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.fixyourownprinter.com.

Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices. This web site will notify you of:

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site
  2. The organization collecting the information
  3. How the information is used
  4. With whom the information may be shared
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under fixyourownprinter.com control
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information



 **Information Collection and Use**

fixyourownprinter.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. fixyourownprinter.com collects information from our visitors at several different points on our website.

 **Order**

We request information from the visitor on our order form. Here a visitor must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor.

 **Cookies**

We, ourselves, do not use cookies in any form on this site; however, some of our business partners may (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

 **Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill visitors for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

 **Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we at fixyourownprinter.com are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

 **Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our visitors' information. When visitors submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks visitors to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just `surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect visitor-information off-line. All of our visitors' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

 **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our visitors are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify visitors by way of an email. visitors will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
