#### What we collect

We may collect the following information:

  * name (if you provide it to us)
  * contact email address (if you provide it to us)
  * computer IP address
  * other information relevant to our applications such as **anonymous** usage statistics
  * data you provide in the use of our applications and services (e.g. if you use our MiniNote cloud syncing service, we will hold the note data you provide on our secure cloud servers)



#### What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * Internal record keeping
  * Improving our applications and services
  * Sending emails about our applications using the email address which you have explicitly provided
  * Website and application anonymous usage/traffic monitoring
  * Application specific features such as user accounts for data syncing etc
  * We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests

In all such cases, we will ensure the service provider agrees to keep the data confidential. This is quite standard with all companies, so there is no cause for concern. For example, we have to store the data you provide to us to make the note cloud syncing service possible with hosting companies, such as Amazon Cloud. This is required for the cloud syncing to function. Also, if you provide us with your email address, then we'll have to hold your contact details with our mailing list provider, MailChimp
