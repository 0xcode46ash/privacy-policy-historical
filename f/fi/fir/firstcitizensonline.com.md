## Keeping Your Financial Information Secure...  
We're On It.

First Citizens understands the importance of keeping your personal information secure. We use state-of-the-art technology to protect the information you entrust to us. What's more, our associates are committed to guarding your personal information — both online and in person at our branch locations.

We’re also committed to protecting the privacy of the information we collect and retain about you. Read our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/FirstCitizensPrivacyNotice.pdf) to learn more. You also play a major role in protecting your personal data, and the more you know about the risks, the better prepared you can be. 

## [Protecting Your Identity](https://web.archive.org/privacy/id_theft.html)

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information — such as your name, Social Security Number or credit card account number — without your permission to commit fraud or other crimes. You may not even realize that you are a victim until you review your credit report or a credit card statement. 

## [E-mail Security](https://web.archive.org/privacy/email_security.html)

E-mail sent over the internet can be intercepted by others, and it can be used to infect your computer with dangerous viruses. Use caution with attachments and be suspicious of any e-mail that asks you to provide personal information.

## [Online Fraud Prevention](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fraud_prevention.html)

Every day criminals are targeting bank customers and their online transactions in order to commit fraud. Your financial information may be at risk if these organizations are successful in compromising your business or personal computer.
