# Firetalk - Privacy

  |  Protecting your privacy is important to Firetalk Communications. We hope the following policy will help you understand how Firetalk Communications collects and uses the information that you provide us when you use the Firetalk service. 

**Registration Information**  


Upon registration, you are required to provide Firetalk Communications with a valid email address (which you have the ability to hide from all other Firetalk users), a nickname, and a first and last name of your choice. Firetalk Communications will then email to you your Firetalk password (which you are free to change) and a Firetalk user ID which you will need to log on to the Firetalk service. During registration you may also be requested to provide us with additional information for your personal profile, i.e. company name, comments, etc. although this information is not required to register with the Firetalk service. If you acquire the Firetalk application from a third party (not Firetalk or firetalk.com) with whom you have an existing relationship (e.g. your Internet Service Provider), we may be required to provide that third party with your registration information, but only in the few exceptional cases where this is a contractual obligation between Firetalk Communications and the third party and only in the case that the third party has agreed not to provide your registration information to another party without your prior consent. Except as discussed in this paragraph, Firetalk Communications does not provide your registration information to any third parties without your prior consent. 

**Email Information**  


When you provide us with your email address, we may ask you if we can use it to send you updates on the latest Firetalk features and promotions. We may also ask you to share your personal information with other companies that offer related services. If you do not want us or other companies to email you, you can choose to "opt out," and Firetalk Communications will respect your wishes. 

Firetalk Communications provides our users with an easy means to decline to receive emails. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving emails from us by simply replying to the email and informing us of your preferences. All emails that you receive from Firetalk Communications will tell you how to decline further emails. 

**Demographic Information**  


To attract sponsors, Firetalk Communications may ask you to provide us with demographic information about you. You are not obligated to respond to these requests and, if you do, such demographic information will only be distributed to sponsors in aggregate form, not an individual-by-individual basis. 

**Additional Personal Information**  


Firetalk Communications' customer service representatives are instructed not to ask for personal information from our users through the Firetalk service. If we need additional information that you did not provide during registration (such as your telephone number or mailing address), we will ask you to send it to an email address at Firetalk Communications. However, you are under no obligation to provide such information. 

**User's Request for Termination**  


Firetalk Communications will honor any request by a user to terminate his or her account. 

We continuously strive to do everything we can to protect the privacy of our users. Nonetheless, we are aware that evolving technologies present new challenges for user privacy. Please feel free to contact us with any concerns you may have at [support@firetalk.com](mailto:support@firetalk.com). Firetalk Communications will do its best to address them.
