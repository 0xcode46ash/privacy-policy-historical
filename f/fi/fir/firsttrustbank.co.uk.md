**Please note that references to "we" means AIB Group (UK) p.l.c. trading as First Trust Bank and our subsidiaries and associates.  
Where reference to 'AIB Group' is made, this means Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c., its subsidiaries and associated companies. This includes AIB Group (UK) p.l.c.**

**Use of Personal Information**

Information which we hold now, or obtain and hold at any time in the future, about you and your relationship with us may be recorded, analysed, assessed, used and held by us for the purposes set out below. This information includes any information which relates to or comes from:   
\- information, appraisal, proposal, referral or application forms or other dealings with us;   
\- your chosen products and services; the conduct of any agreement(s) and/or account(s) with us, if any, including details of transactions, the nature of same, with whom and how payment is effected; and information supplied by others and/or obtained by us as a result of enquiries we make, such as third parties associated with you and licensed credit reference agencies.

Similar information about you may be held now, or obtained, recorded and held at any time in the future, by other companies in the AIB Group. This information, subject to any Financial Services Authority regulations and the law, may be disclosed to us and may also be recorded, analysed, assessed, used and held by us for the purposes set out below.

**1.  
** To consider any requests, proposals or applications you make for products or services and to assist in credit assessment and in the management of agreements and/or accounts.

When considering an application, we may use credit scoring and other automated decision-making systems. We may also carry out a voters roll search (for the purpose of verifying your identity) and/or a credit search with one or more licensed credit reference agencies. Licensed credit reference agencies will record details of each type of search we make whether or not an application proceeds. A credit search will not be carried out in relation to saving or investment products. Voters roll searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. We may also search the AIB Group records. In addition, we may need to make and retain photocopies of passports, driving licences or other identification evidence that you supply.

We may give details of your credit Agreements and how you conduct these Agreements to licensed credit reference agencies on a regular basis. In particular, we may give those agencies details of non-payment where:   
\- you have fallen behind with your payments,   
\- the amount owed is not in dispute; and   
\- you have not made proposals satisfactory to us for repayment of your debt, following formal demand; and   
\- you have been given at least 28 days notice of our intention to disclose.

Information held by licensed credit reference agencies will be used by lenders (including us) and others in making lending decisions about you and members of your household, for occasional debt tracing and fraud prevention purposes.

On a regular basis, we may, when administering your agreement(s) with us or when making any lending decision, search the AIB Group records, use credit scoring and other automated decision-making systems and carry out further searches with one or more licensed credit reference agencies. Such agencies will keep a record of each search.

You have the right of access to your personal records held by licensed credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. Please write to AIB Group (UK) p.l.c FREEPOST BEL2196, Belfast BT1 3BR or telephone us on FREEPHONE 0800 3896218 if you want to have details of those credit reference and fraud prevention agencies from whom we obtain and to whom we pass information about you. You have a legal right to this information.

In the event of a claim, information you have supplied, including that detailed on application and claim forms, will be put on a register and made available to participants. Further information is available from your insurer(s), including the details of any register to which it contributes and a list of its participants. If we transfer information about you to our agent in another country outside the UK, we will make sure that the information will be adequately protected by the agent agreeing to apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to information held about you in the UK.

When you travel to or make foreign purchases by mail, telephone, or electronic mail in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we may also disclose to or access your information in those other countries. Such information may not be afforded the same degree of protection as inside the EEA.
