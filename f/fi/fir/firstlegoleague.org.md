**FIRST LEGO League encourages families to visit firstlegoleague.org together as a shared activity.**

Any information collected may be shared among companies that are part of the [FIRST LEGO League organization.](https://web.archive.org/default.aspx?pid=7350)

In some instances, we may need to disclose personal information about you to companies that we hire to help us provide services to you - for example to ship products that you have purchased. However, such companies will be under an obligation to keep your personal information confidential. 

We may disclose personal information collected from you as required by law, for example in response to a court order or subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a specific request from a law enforcement agency. 

Except as set out above, we will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose any personal information to any company or person outside the FIRST LEGO League organization, without obtaining appropriate permission prior to such disclosure.

We may collect personal information directly from you through our sites when: 1) you sign up for the FIRST LEGO League FORUM; 2) you sign up to receive newsletters and other information; 3) when you register on the site. We also use passive means to collect some information, such as tracking what pages you go to on the site.

We will not use personal information we collect from you for purposes other than those for which the information was collected, without asking for appropriate permission prior to such use. 

Upon request, you have the right to review any personal information we may have concerning you or your children; see Guests Under the Age of 13 below, and How to Change or Review the Information in Your Online Account or Club Membership below. 

  
**FIRST LEGO League FORUM Membership** **  
**  
Firstlegoleague.org has many different activities you can participate in without giving us any personal information at all. However, if you decide to sign up as a FIRST LEGO League FORUM Member, we will need to obtain some information in order to provide you with the benefits of FORUM  membership. When you sign up for the FIRST LEGO League FORUM We will not ask for your real name, your mailing address, your e-mail address or any other information that will identify you as an individual.

  
**Children Under the Age of 13    
**  
When a child under the age of 13 contacts the FIRST LEGO League organization online, for example to participate in a contest or to ask a question we will collect that child's email address and the e-mail address of the child's parent or guardian. We will use the child's e-mail address only for the purpose for which it was collected, and we will use the e-mail address of the parents or guardians only to provide notification about the child's contact with us, and to provide notification of the types and uses of information collected as required under the law. We will also provide information as to how the parent or guardian of the child can review and request deletion of the child's personal information, and how to prevent further collection and use of personal information concerning the child. 

As a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 from whom we have collected personal information, you have the right to review and have deleted such personal information, and to refuse to permit further collection or use of such information. To do so, you should contact us by using the contact information set forth at the end of this privacy policy. Parents and guardians who wish to review personal information concerning their children will be required to specify the usernames and passwords of the children concerned, and to provide their own e-mail address for verification and contact purposes. 

No personal information collected from children under 13 will be sold, rented or otherwise disclosed to any company outside the FIRST LEGO League organization, except for disclosure to companies acting as our agents to help us provide services requested by the child, or pursuant to court order, subpoena or a specific request from a law enforcement agency. 

We cannot and will not establish conditions that will require or encourage children to disclose personal information over and above what is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity features on our web sites. 

Children under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests. However, if such a child wins, notification will be sent to the parent or guardian's e-mail address (provided by the child when he/she enters the contest). Also, we will not ask the child for any personal information beyond e-mail addresses without obtaining prior parental consent. Any personal information obtained from children and parents during contests will be kept until the contest ends and prizes are delivered, and then it will be deleted. 

If any activity featured on firstlegoleague.orgm will allow children under the age of 13 to reveal personal information publicly (for example, via un-moderated Message boards), we will obtain parental consent before allowing the child to participate. Currently, all such activities are moderated, monitored and screened.
