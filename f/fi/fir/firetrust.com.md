**Firetrust website policy**

We believe it is important that you know how we treat information about you which we receive via the Internet. Our commitment to personal privacy is paramount - none of our products contain any form of Adware or Spyware. 

Firetrust Limited lets you visit the Firetrust website without revealing any personal information about yourself. We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies (personal information) you. Firetrust requests personal information from our users at several different points on our website. We may ask you for your email address prior to downloading evaluation software. The personal information we collect is used only to respond to your inquiry, process an order, allow you to access specific account information, or advise you of special promotions, discounts, updates and new products. 

Firetrust is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not use or disclose this information for purposes other than those set out in this statement or in our end user agreement.

**Order and Credit Card Information**

Firetrust uses WorldPay, a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the Firetrust.com store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the Firetrust.com store, WorldPay provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Firetrust. Firetrust uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, Firetrust uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by Firetrust. 

WorldPay requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on the WorldPay web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Your credit card information does not pass through the WorldPay sites under the terms of Firetrust's agreement with WorldPay. WorldPay does not share credit card information with Firetrust. WorldPay keeps your credit card information confidential and protect your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology. 

We also use PayPal as a third-party payment provider.
