**Firetrust website policy**

We believe it is important that you know how we treat information about you which we receive via the Internet. Our commitment to personal privacy is paramount - none of our products contain any form of Adware of Spyware. 

Firetrust Limited lets you visit the Firetrust website without revealing any personal information about yourself. We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies (personal information) you. Firetrust requests personal information from our users at several different points on our website. The personal information we collect is used only to respond to your inquiry, process an order, allow you to access specific account information, or advise you of special promotions, discounts, updates and new products. 

Firetrust is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not use or disclose this information for purposes other than those set out in this statement or in our end user agreement. 

By using this site or any services provided through the site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**Your email address**

We collect your email address to either generate a registration code for your purchased product and/or to contact you regarding your purchase and/or to keep you informed of updates and product announcements. Your email address is never passed to 3rd parties except in the event of product announcements for which we use a 3rd party email sending service provided by one of our ecommerce payment providers, element5.com

**Order and Credit Card Information**

Firetrust uses Element5, PayPal and Worldpay as third-party payment providers of e-commerce solutions, to power the Firetrust.com store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the Firetrust.com store, 'Payment provider' provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Firetrust. Firetrust uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, Firetrust uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by Firetrust. 

'Payment provider' requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on their 'payment provider' web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Your credit card information does not pass through the 'payment provider' site under the terms of Firetrust's agreement with 'payment provider'. 'Payment provider' does not share credit card information with Firetrust. 'Payment provider' keeps your credit card information confidential and protects your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology.
