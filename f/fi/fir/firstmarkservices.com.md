_**Firstmark Services Privacy Policy – Online Information**_  
We at Firstmark Services are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience and to protecting your personal information during your visit. When you access a Firstmark Services website, you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all information we collect is treated as confidential. To access student loan account information and send emails via our website, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (IE 8.0 or higher or Chrome). This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet.

Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure website, Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select “Properties”. If the website address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” indicates a secure site or area of the site.

When you enter a Firstmark Services website, you will pass through our security “firewall” and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device. The IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.

Firstmark Services websites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive (with your permission) by a web page server. Accepting a cookie from a Firstmark Services website does not give Firstmark Services access to your computer or any personal information about you. Also, the type of cookies we use don’t get stored permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and are deleted. You can also set up your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.

Firstmark Services websites do not respond to a do-not-track setting or other mechanisms that provide the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information of your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

We don’t knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to ours.

_**Introduction**_  
This Policy explains our collection and use practices regarding consumer information, including how and what we share with our related companies and with unrelated entities. Protecting your privacy is important to Firstmark Services and our employees. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. This Policy is the standard for Firstmark Services employees regarding collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information. If you pay off your loan(s) we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

Please note that since Firstmark Services services, but does not own, your student loan, your lender’s privacy policy primarily applies with respect to use of your personal information, and you should review that policy as well. Firstmark Services complies with the privacy policies of our lender clients. The information in this Policy applies to individuals only, and we may change the policies from time to time. The effective date of this Policy is January 1, 2014.

_**Why We Collect Information**_  
We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, manage and protect your accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and offer you products and services you might be interested in, and to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.

_**What We Collect**_  
We may collect “nonpublic personal information” about you from the following sources:

* Information from your loan applications or other loan and account forms.  
* Information about your transactions with us or others; and  
* Information we receive from third parties, such as credit bureaus.

“Nonpublic personal information” is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance, payment history, and overdraft history, if applicable.

We may collect “personally identifiable information” about you as well, including:

* your first and last name  
* your home address  
* your home or work telephone number  
* your Social Security number  
* your driver’s license number  
* your birth date  
* your email address

“Personally identifiable information” is individually identifiable information about an individual consumer collected by the operator of a website and maintained in an accessible form.

If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don’t want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your email address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone.

If you wish to change any of your personal information, you may change it through the website, or by contacting Customer Service, either through email, by mail, or by telephone.

_**What We Share**_  
We are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to other third parties in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us, to government entities in response to subpoenas, and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you except as permitted by law.

If you pay your loan in full or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

VERMONT RESIDENTS: We will not disclose nonpublic personal financial information about you other than as permitted by law unless you authorize us to make that disclosure. Your authorization must be in writing or, if you agree, in electronic form. If you wish to authorize us to disclose your nonpublic personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties, you may notify us at the address found on the privacy policy you received by mail that is used for non-Vermont residents to Opt Out.

_**Other Situations**_  
Sometimes the law or other circumstances also require that we disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties. Some examples are: when you ask or permit us to do so; when a guaranty agency, school or the Department of Education need that information in connection with your account, with agencies that assist us in servicing your loan; in response to subpoenas or court orders; with credit bureaus; or when we suspect fraud or criminal activity.

We do not collect or share personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites.

_**Our Security Procedures**_  
Firstmark Services takes careful steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and we regularly train our employees on privacy, information security, and their obligation to protect your information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and industry standards to guard your personal information and we regularly test those safeguards to maintain the appropriate levels of protection.

Our Information Security divisions continually update and improve the security standards and procedures we use to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your confidential information, including through the Internet. We also build checks and balances into our procedures so that we can properly identify our customers.

You can help safeguard your personal information by taking a few simple precautions. Protect your account numbers, passwords, PIN’s, and customer access numbers. Never disclose confidential information to unknown callers. You should always use a secure browser and current virus detection software, and never open e-mail from unknown sources.
