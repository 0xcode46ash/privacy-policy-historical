First Data Merchant Services Corporation ("FDMS")   
Privacy Principles

As a world leader in electronic commerce and payment services, FDMS processes the information that enables businesses and consumers to pay for goods and services by credit, debit or stored-value cards at the point of sale. 

FDMS works behind the scenes on behalf of its alliances, banks, other card acquirers and merchants. As the internet continues to play a greater role in commerce and payments, FDMS will continue to develop solutions that enable businesses and consumers to pay anyone, anywhere, anytime. 

Millions of consumers and businesses rely on FDMS, and our client partners, for safe and reliable payment services. Our relationships are established based on mutual trust. Each day, we - and our more than 9,000 employees \- strive to reinforce our commitment to our business customers and consumers. 

In order to provide these services, FDMS must collect, maintain and use financial and other sensitive personal information. 

FDMS' Privacy Principles guide us in the collection and use of information and reinforce the role our employees play in protecting consumer privacy. 

Our business customers and alliances may adopt other principles applicable to their collection and use of information or simply customize these principles.

**_FDMS Privacy Principles_**

  1. **_WE OBTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE OUR GOODS AND SERVICES._ **



We primarily receive personal information as a result of consumers' financial transactions with FDMSSM or with FDMS business customers and alliances. Generally, FDMS does not obtain personal information directly from consumers. However, when FDMS collects information directly from consumers, we obtain the personal information that is needed to provide our goods or services, to provide customer service and to fulfill any legal or regulatory requirements. When we obtain information about consumers from third parties, we use reputable sources, including public repositories.

  2. **_WE WILL INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE GENERAL USES OF THEIR INFORMATION._ **



Generally, FDMS does not have a direct customer relationship with consumers. However, when we have a direct relationship with consumers, we will strive to make information available to them about the general uses of the information that we collect. Generally, FDMS obtains personal information about consumers indirectly through our business customers and channels. To that end, we encourage our business customers and channels to provide these consumers with a timely and complete privacy notice. 

  3. **_WE USE CONSUMER INFORMATION IN A MANNER WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRIVACY NOTICE._**



FDMS uses information only in a manner consistent with our privacy notice. Protecting consumer privacy is very important as we build trusted relationships and assist businesses and consumers in conducting sensitive and wide-ranging electronic commerce activities. 

  4. **_WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL CONSUMER INFORMATION._**



Within FDMS, access to personal information is limited to those employees of FDMS and its affiliates who need it to fulfill their business responsibilities. 

When FDMS collects information on behalf of our business customers and alliances, we handle the information based on their direction and in accordance with our agreements and contracts with them and applicable laws.

Vendors and other outside contractors we engage are subject to our contractual requirements to ensure sensitive personal information is safeguarded. 

  5. **_WE STRIVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS CHOICES ABOUT HOW THEIR DATA WILL BE USED._**



If we obtain personal information as part of our direct relationship with consumers, we will not share this information with non-affiliated third parties except in accordance with these Privacy Principles; to facilitate and complete consumer-initiated or authorized transactions; to comply with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card association rules; to combat fraud; or to offer products and services that FDMS believes may be of interest to its customers. Upon request, we will allow consumers to remove their names from any FDMS-owned marketing lists.

  6. **_WE USE APPROPRIATE SECURITY SAFEGUARDS._**



At FDMS, security is a priority. We employ appropriate measures to protect consumer information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These may include, among others, encryption, physical access security and other appropriate technologies. FDMS continually reviews and enhances its security systems, as necessary.

  7. **_WE MAINTAIN PROCEDURES TO ASSURE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE WILL INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MAKE CORRECTIONS, IF NECESSARY._**



Generally, FDMS does not collect personal information directly from consumers. However, where information is collected by FDMS directly from consumers, we permit them to review and, if possible, dispute or correct any erroneous or out-of-date information stored in our database, which is retrievable on a personally identifiable basis. (Of course, this review and correction would not be possible if the information is proprietary to one of our business customers or if access would violate the privacy or legal rights of a third party).

  8. **_WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES._**



FDMS is committed to meeting the highest standards for our privacy program. A senior FDMS official serves as the company-wide privacy officer, with responsibility for administering the FDMS privacy program, including implementation of these Privacy Principles.
