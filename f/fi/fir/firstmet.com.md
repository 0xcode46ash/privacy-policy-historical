**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY (“PRIVACY POLICY”) CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE USING OUR SNAP WEBSITE OR FIRSTMET (“FirstMet”) WEBSITES, APPLICATIONS OR ANY OTHER FIRSTMET PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.**

Snap Interactive, Inc. has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the Snap and FirstMet (formerly known as “Are You Interested” or “AYI”) websites, mobile websites, mobile applications and related offline and online services and tools that link to or reference this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the “Services”). Any Snap owned services linked to other privacy policies are governed by that service’s privacy policy. Snap provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services. Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. **If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or Terms of Use** **which govern your use of our Services, please discontinue accessing or using the Services.**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service found at [http://snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/](http://www.snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/ "Terms of Service") (“Terms”).

  
**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**_Account and Profile Information You Provide to Us_** **.** We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for our Services, interact with our Services, create or update your account or profile, interact with other users, use various features of our Services, or to communicate directly with us. That information may include but is not limited to location, date of birth (or age), name, email address, interests, and photos. We may combine that information with other information collected from the devices you use to access our Services, such as your mobile device model, and system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device and other demographics.

When you create a profile, create an account or use certain Services (such as searching for members) or otherwise engage with our Services, you may provide certain additional information such as username and password. You may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, and name and billing address to purchase for example, a premium membership to FirstMet. We may also collect information about the website you visited before you came to our Services and the website you visited after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied by your browser.

**_Your Imported Profile from Social Networks_** **.** When using our Services and applicable third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google +) (each and collectively, a “Social Network”), you may have the option to consent to connecting your profile or activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you choose to use our Social Network populating feature to create an account, we may import information for your account or profile on our Services from a Social Network. We only import from the information you allow to be imported from the Social Network access to which is controlled by your privacy settings on that Social Network (“Permitted Social Network Content”). The authentication of your Social Network login credentials is conducted solely by the Social Network. If you do use this feature we will initially create your profile by displaying your first name as the user name displayed to other users, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate). With your permission, we may also combine that information with your public social media profile (which may include your friend list, birthday, work history, interests, current city, photos, personal description and likes). By associating your Social Network account with our Services and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store Permitted Social Network Content across all our Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**_Surveys and Promotions_**. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, contests or sweepstakes.  Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. Contact information may be used as set forth in this policy and as set forth in the official rules, to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey.

**_Information You Post_** **.** The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the Services or Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by Snap and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.

**_Mobile Information_**. We may collect additional information from you if you access Services through a mobile device, for example your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, location or with your permission GPS/geo-location, and billing information which we may collect when you opt in for us to do so. Please be advised some features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi, etc.).

**_Information About Others/Inviting Friends._** From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join a Service. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

For data collection practices via cookies placed by third party advertisers on ads that appear on our Services (and for which we are not responsible), please click on the Adchoices icon in the ad, if available or go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

As such, we do not currently respond to these signals. Your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads.

We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third party sites or applications to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors.

**_Security_** **.** We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control, including “Secure Socket Layers” or SSL to protect your data. SSL is encryption technology that helps safeguard your personally identifiable information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information, and your use of the Services indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.

**_Jurisdiction and Cross-Border Issues_**. We do not represent or warrant that our Services are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Services do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.

If you become aware that anyone under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” in Section 7 below.

By accessing the Services after the Effective Date you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy.

**TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

**_Cookies_** **.** A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.

**_HTML5_** **.** We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile Device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

**_Web Beacons/GIFS_** **.** Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**_Embedded Scripts_** **.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**_e-tags/cache browsers/web logs_** **.** Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

**_Device Fingerprinting_** **.** We may use device fingerprinting in some of our Services, which allows us to collect information about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. It can be used to prevent fraud or collect information about you.

**_IDFA_** **.** The IDFA is a device identifier that is used by many software kit developers for various reasons including to measure user behavior in mobile apps. Additionally, the IDFA is the shared identifier between an ad network and an ad server to report which networks delivered a particular download.
