# Firehouse Subs

We are Firehouse Restaurant Group, Inc. Your privacy is important to us, which is why we have developed this online “Privacy Policy” to explain our practices regarding the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information we obtain online from users of our family of Websites, located at www.firehousesubs.com, and its [their] related links, webpages and content we own or control (“FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites”). If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please send us an email (writing "Privacy Policy" in the subject line) at [ privacy@firehousesubs.com](mailto:privacy@firehousesubs.com)) at 3410 Kori Road, Jacksonville, Florida 32257; or call us at (904) 886-8300. If for any reason you feel that we have not followed our stated policy, please tell us by e-mail at [ privacy@firehousesubs.com](mailto:privacy@firehousesubs.com). We will look into your concern and try to resolve any problem. In the future, we may modify our web site policies. Please check this page for any changes.

**Collecting Information**

Through our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from anyone unless that person specifies it or it’s provided by someone else. For example, you might be asked to voluntarily give your name, postal address, email address and phone number, and credit card or Pay-Pal information to us when, if to the extent possible, via the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, you purchase products from our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, provide feedback on our products, apply for a job online or fill out a franchise questionnaire. We may also collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregate basis. 

At some of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, you may be able to submit information about other people. For example, while most of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites do not engage in on-line sales, you might be provided the option of ordering a gift, gift certificate or any products or service online. If so, you may want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. It is also possible that someone may provide us with your personally identifiable information, with or without your permission.

For reasons such as improving your experience at our Websites or personalizing our Websites to you (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we may supplement the information that you provide with information from third parties.

**Using Your Information**

Generally speaking, we make reasonable efforts to not share your personally identifiable information with outside third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy policy without your permission. However, to serve you better we may share information about you with independently owned and operated FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisees, state regulators, or product vendors and others we deem necessary.

We, FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, or our third party vendors, may access, use or disclose your personally identifiable information to operate, maintain, service or improve our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, provide targeted offers to you, analyze our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites to make any of them more effective, or for other general internal business purposes, or when we believe, in our sole judgement, that the law requires it. We may disclose aggregated information about our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites to third parties. 

We may disclose your information in response to legal process or when we, in or sole judgement, believe that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Website, users of our Websites, and others. In addition, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets or the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites or one of the members of our family of Websites, or if any of our FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. 

**Contacting You**

Occasionally we or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisees may send you email communications or otherwise contact you to provide information or offers that we or they think you will find useful. You can choose not to receive any future emails or communications from us or any FIREHOUSE SUBS franchise by following the procedure described in the "Controlling or Changing Your Information" section below. Please note that we or any FIREHOUSE SUBS franchise may occasionally contact you for administrative purposes even if you unsubscribe from our or their email lists 

**Controlling or Changing Your Information**

You can review, change, or request the deletion of your contact information and preferences at any time by sending us an email at [ privacy@firehousesubs.com](mailto:privacy@firehousesubs.com)  requesting your name and contact information be changed or removed from any or all of our or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisee databases. We will make best efforts to update your information as soon as practicable, however, to the extent that corrected or deleted information is also stored in other databases or any FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises’ databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases. FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises are independently owned and operated by others, not us. Therefore, while we will endeavor to require FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises to comply with this Privacy Policy, we have no responsibility to you whatsoever for FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises violations of any aspect of this Privacy Policy. 

**Cookies**

We or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises may use cookies to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your browser places on your computer's hard drive, which we may use to track items you have placed in your shopping cart or to learn how you arrived at our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. Cookies are also used to save and retrieve your e-mail address, password and preferences so you do not have to re-enter this information each time you visit our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions or help screen to learn about how you can monitor your computer’s acceptance of "cookies".

In some cases we or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises may track or collect information about your use of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Site by the numeric address assigned to the computer you are using (your IP address) or by the URLs that you come from or leave to. These methods also allow us, or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, to resolve server problems or administer our or their FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. Currently, we and FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises do not associate this information with any other personally identifiable information that you may have provided us or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises but we or they may do so at any time, without notice to you.

Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors   
Our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites may contain links to other Websites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult these other Websites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

We or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises sometimes may offer content (e.g., products or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the FIREHOUSE SUBS Site activity. We have no control over these third-parties’ use of this information. Our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites may, but are not obligated to, notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third-parties will obtain such information. 

**A Note to Parents/Guardians**

We would like to help you protect your children’s privacy. Please speak with your children about the importance of safeguarding their personal information. We urge you to monitor and supervise your children’s on-line activities. We ask anyone under the age of 16 to get their parent’s approval before giving us any personal information. We would be very happy to have you visit the FIREHOUSE SUBS web site with your children.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites so you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

**Security**

We may require that a secure connection between your computer and our server be established before you can utilize all or a portion of the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. To do this, we may utilize a technology like Secure Socket Layers (SSL), an advanced encryption technology. Currently, we do not utilize secure connections with any aspect of the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites.

If you'd like to know if you are using a secure connection, you can check the icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your Web browser's window. If the icon appears as either a closed lock or an unbroken key, you are communicating with us via a secure connection (the form of the icon varies by browser and version number). 

Although we use these industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Without limiting any other limitations of liability, we have indicated in this Privacy Policy, we have no responsibility whatsoever for breaches of this policy caused, directly or indirectly, by, in whole or in part, the illegal, unethical, malicious, mischievous, or unauthorized acts of any third parties.

**Our Franchisees**

If you are a FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisee, or an employee or agent of one of the FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, your use of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, will also be governed by the Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policies we specifically designate for FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisees, their employees and agents.
