Collecting Information

In general, through our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, we take reasonable steps to avoid collecting any personally identifiable information from anyone unless that person specifies it or it’s provided by someone else. For example, you might be asked to voluntarily give your name, postal address, email address and phone number, and credit card or Pay-Pal Information to us when, if to the extent possible, via the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, you purchase products from our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, provide feedback on our products, apply for a job online or fill out a franchise questionnaire. We may also collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregate basis.

How we collect information about you. We collect information in 3 ways:

1\. We collect information that our customers or visitors to FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites (including you) supply to us.

2\. We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by you, other customers and users of the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site.

3\. We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including customers, by means of cookies.

Types of personal information we may collect from you and other users.

1\. Product Purchases:

Every time you use the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site to purchase goods or services, we may collect information about the FIREHOUSE SUBS® restaurants you select and the orders you place.

To obtain services from the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may be required to provide us with your full legal name, email address, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. And, to obtain certain services from the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may also be required to choose your “username” and /or “password” and provide those to us.

At some our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, you may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, while most of our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites do not engage in on-line sales, you might be provided the option of ordering a gift, gift certificate or any products or service online. To do so you may be required to provide us personally identifiable information. For example, when you place an order with us by telephone or means other than our online ordering service, you may be required to provide us with your full legal name, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. When or if you place an order through the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may want the item purchased sent directly to the recipient; therefore, you might submit the recipient’s name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. It is also possible that someone may provide us with your personally identifiable information, with or without your permission.

2\. Promotions:

We, or through third-party merchants, vendors and others we designate, may offer users of the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site special offers, contests or other promotions (“Promotions”), we may provide to them the means via our website, mail, or email to contact you about our or their Promotions. However, if you have opted not to receive e-mails or other communications from us, we will make reasonable efforts not to provide your e-mail address, mailing address or other data or information to any third party for promotional or other commercial purposes, except with your prior consent.

You are under no obligation to respond to any Promotion but if you do, you may be required to provide additional information, such as your birth date and whether you or anyone in your household is employed by the merchant who is extending the offer, in order to verify your eligibility for accepting the offer or participation in the Promotion. For any such Promotion, your provision of information to us or the merchant may be governed by the merchant's privacy policy, not our privacy policy.

3\. Third-Party Information:

For reasons such as improving your experience at our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site or personalizing our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site to you (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we may supplement the information that you provide with information from third parties.

4\. Information Regarding Children:

Online ordering, customer registration for on-line ordering, and customer feedback pages of the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site are directed toward and designed for use only by persons aged 16 or older. We do not establish or maintain registrations for any child whom we know to be under the age of 16. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. If we discover or are made aware that we have received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 16, we will delete such information from our systems.

5\. Use of Cookies:

Like many websites on the Internet, our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site uses “cookies” – small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and in recording any preferences you indicate on our website.

Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie identifies your browser and user ID (and not your identity). If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is a single visit by you to our website).

We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases or may lease the use of such equipment and services from others. Access to our computer servers is controlled by security gatekeepers and firewalls.
