|  |  |  |  privacy  statement  
---  
   
I.      | Introduction.  
  |  First USA recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of our Cardmembers and applicants, and we want to assure you that any information First USA gathers will be used for its own business needs.  First USA will not sell or share any information that we learn about you from our web site, other than as described below, and First USA will gather only information it needs to serve you better.  
  |  First USA also recognizes the need for security on the Internet, which is why we have Internet security standards and procedures in place to protect against unauthorized disclosure of information or access to information about you from our web site.  In addition, we limit employee access to personally identifiable information about you to those employees who have a business purpose for access to such information.  
II. | Does First USA collect Personal Information?  
  | Yes, First USA obtains personal information in four ways:  
  | 1.    | Your Application.  
  |   |  First USA's principal business is to offer credit cards.  On our applications we ask you to provide us with the following information:  
  |   | 

  * Name
  * Mailing addresses, and in some circumstances your email address
  * Birth Date 
  * Social security number
  * Number of dependants
  * Occupation 
  * Income 
  * Home and business phone numbers
  * Whether you own or rent your residence
  * Whether you have a checking and savings account

  
  |   | In addition, we may request information that helps us keep your account secure, for example, your mother's maiden name.  
  |   |  We request this information whether the application is made on or off-line.  We use this information to evaluate your creditworthiness and prevent fraudulent applications or use of credit cards.  We will not be able to process your application if you do not provide us with the information requested on the application.  
  |   |  We recognize that you may have concerns about the security of your personal information in making an application online.  If you are not comfortable applying online, you may submit an application by calling us at the phone number on the on-line application or by printing the application screen and mailing it to us at:   
  | First Credit Card Services USA, LLC   
P.O. Box 8561   
Wilmington, Delaware 19899-8651   
---|---  
  |   |  As part of the application process, you expressly authorize us to obtain a credit bureau report for our use in evaluating your application and subsequently in connection with a requested charge to your account, a change in your credit line or periodic review of your account.  The credit report contains information about your credit history, and is also one of the tools we use for fraud prevention.  As discussed below, you have certain rights regarding your credit bureau reports.  
---|---|---  
  | 2. | Your Statement and Communications with First USA.  
  |   |  Upon issuance of the credit card, we track your card usage including where and how you use the credit card.  This information is provided to you on your monthly statement.  In addition, we keep track of when and why you write us or speak to us regarding your account or goods and services provided by, on behalf of or in conjunction with First USA.  This allows us to provide consistent quality service.  
  | 3. | Our Partners.  
  |   |  We have over 1,300 co-brand and affinity partners.  We extend credit card offers to those affiliated with or who are members or patrons of our Partners for the benefit of both our Cardmember and our Partner.  In order to extend a credit card offer, our Partner provides us with names and addresses of the people who have relationships with the Partner.   
  | 4. | Visiting First USA on the Web.  
  |   |  We obtain information on-line.  We track the flow of traffic on our web site.  We obtain personal information from visitors to our site at the time a visitor applies for a credit card.  In addition, our computer and your computer may communicate during your visit to our web site, which allows us to customize screens and identify which part(s) of the site has been accessed.

First USA uses cookies in places where you need to register, such as First USA Cardmember Services.  Recording a cookie at such points makes your online experience easier and more personalized.  A cookie is a way for web sites to recognize whether or not you have visited the site before.  It is a piece of data given to a browser by a web server, so that the browser will hand it back to the server on subsequent visits.  They do not read your hard drive nor can they be used to reveal anything about you that you have not already explicitly revealed.  
  
III. | How does First USA use Personal Information?  
  | First USA uses personal information several ways:  
  |  First, as noted above, First USA uses information to evaluate your application to determine whether to issue a credit card and, if we open an account, to establish your line of credit.  After that, we use the information to provide our Cardmembers with the highest level of service and to protect our Cardmembers from fraudulent use of the account.   
  |  Second, First USA is always looking for opportunities to provide value to our Cardmembers by making available offers of goods and services that are suited to the needs and interests of our Cardmembers.  When we identify an interesting opportunity, we review our Cardmember base to identify those Cardmembers we think would be most interested in that opportunity.  We compile a list of Cardmembers that we use in one of two ways:   
  | (a) | We include the offers for goods or services with the Cardmembers' monthly statements which results in no sharing of personal information with third parties; or  
  | (b) | We arrange to extend the offers of goods or services to the Cardmembers by direct mail, email or telemarketing.  The actual sending of the offer, may be conducted by third party processors or vendors.  We require that these third parties hold the information we provide in the strictest confidence.  A third party can not use the list for any purpose other than the particular offer of goods or services approved by First USA for which the information is provided.  First USA takes security precautions that allow us to monitor, identify and prevent misuse of information by third parties.  We limit the information provided to the third party to the information necessary to make the offer and sell products and services to our Cardmembers.  This information is similar to the information a consumer would provide the merchant for an in-store credit card transaction.  As described in Section IV, below, our Cardmember Agreement specifically gives you the opportunity to elect not to receive these offers.  
  |  Third, our Cardmember Agreement provides that we may share information with other Bank One companies (First USA is a Bank One Company).  This may be used for fraud detection or to identify other goods and services offered by Bank One that may be appropriate for you.  In addition, we share our experience with you with other Bank One companies to facilitate those entities' provision of financial services.  
  | Fourth, we, like most, if not all credit card issuers, share our experience with you with credit bureaus.  Our reporting to credit bureaus is governed by Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you have the right to make sure that your credit bureau reports are correct and accurate.  
  | Fifth, we will disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request issued by a court, government agency, or regulatory authority with jurisdiction to make the request.   
IV.    | Do I have to get the Offers of Goods and Services?  
  | No, First USA lets you decide if you want to or do not want to receive these offers of goods and services.  You may also select how you want to receive the offers.  For example, you may choose to receive offers through the mail, by telephone or by email.  You may opt out of one, two or all of these kinds of delivery.  As provided in our Cardmember Agreement, you may choose not to receive the offers of goods and services that we make available to our Cardmembers by writing to us as follows:

V. | What are Credit Bureaus?  
  | Credit bureaus are private organizations that compile your credit history and make that information available to lenders to assess potential borrower's creditworthiness.  We provide the credit bureaus with information regarding the status of your account.  You may contact the credit bureaus as follows:

---|---|---  
  | VI. | How do I Make Sure That the Credit Bureaus Have the Correct Information?  
  |   |  Your rights are governed by Fair Credit Reporting Act and vary depending on whether an action has been taken as a result of a bureau report.  In the event that you want your credit bureau report, you may request it by contacting the particular credit bureau.  You may have to pay a fee for the report.  However, if you have been denied credit based on information in a particular credit bureau report, you are entitled to a free copy of your report from that credit bureau, provided you ask that bureau for a report within 60 days of the notice to you.  In some circumstances you may have to pay a fee to get the report.  You also have the right to challenge the accuracy of information contained on your report.   
  | VII. | Does First USA Recognize That My Screen Name is Different from My Name.  
  |   | Yes!  First USA may, from time to time, extend offers of goods and services to our Cardmembers at their email addresses.  To the extent an offer is made online, in addition to the other protections, First USA does not provide the companies that communicate the offers to you with the information sufficient to link your screen name and your name and address.  In this way we protect your online privacy.  You may opt out of receiving these offers as described above.   
  | VIII. | Does First USA Market to Children?  
  |   |  First USA does not knowingly market to children under the age of 18, nor do we solicit personal information from children.  
  | IX. | Do I Have Access to My Information About My Account?  
  |   | Yes, you have the right to obtain information about you including your application and details of your credit card use.  If you believe there is an error or you have a question about your bill, write us at First USA Bank, N.A., P.O. Box 8651, Wilmington, Delaware 19899-8651 for Platinum cards or First USA Bank, N.A., P.O. Box 8650, Wilmington, Delaware 19899-8650 for Gold and Classic cards.  Write to us as soon as possible.  We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared.  You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights.  In your letter, give us the following information:
