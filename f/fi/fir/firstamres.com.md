# First American Real Estate Solutions :: Privacy Policy

  
  
This privacy statement comprises the privacy policy of First American Real Estate Solutions, L.P. (“FARES”) applicable to websites operated by FARES (the “Websites”). 

**Information Collection and Use**

FARES collects information at various points on the Websites, including personally identifiable information (“PII”). FARES may obtain PII from companies that refer users to the Websites. We may also require credit card account and billing information to secure purchases made by users. 

We collect this information in order to conduct business, improve the Websites’ performance and functionality, service and support our users, and notify users about changes in our business. We may also share information with our affiliates and third parties as described further below under “Information Sharing.” 

If you choose not to provide us information, you may not be granted access to some or all of the pages on the Websites. 

**Registration**

In order to use the Websites you may be required to complete a registration form or contract and forward it to FARES. You may be asked to complete this registration form on-line, or by fax or postal mail. Applications may be subject to a business credit evaluation. 

The registration form includes name and contact information, such as telephone number and e-mail address. We may use this information to contact you about your use of the site and any orders, submissions or inquiries you have made. 

If we accept your registration you may be provided with a user ID and password that will give you access to the services on a Website. You are responsible for maintaining password secrecy. Do not share your password with any other person. Change your password regularly to minimize the possibility of unauthorized access to your account. 

**Order Fulfillment**

Clients may choose to order products electronically from a Website. Completed orders are accessible only to the client that placed the order, and require a valid user ID and password. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a file stored on your hard drive containing information about you. We may use cookies to identify you and provide you a more customized browsing experience while you are on a Website. For example, if you let us put a cookie on your hard drive, we may be able to give you access to pages without requiring you to log in. If you refuse to allow us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may not be granted access to a Website, or you may be restricted from some pages and services.

A Website may contain links to other sites that may use cookie technology. We do not have access to, or control over, these cookies. 

**Log Files**

We may track IP addresses and navigation patterns when we monitor traffic on the Website. We use this information to improve the structure, content and general usability of the Website. Such information may be linked to PII for billing purposes, or to provide service and support to our users. 

**Other Information**

FARES may also collect information identifying the industries in which our clients work. We also collect any information a client chooses to divulge when entering information in a Website’s “user comments” field. 

**Information Sharing**

We may share information about our clients with FARES affiliates and third parties for the purposes of making available products and services we think may be of interest to our clients. We may share information about our clients with intermediaries who facilitate payment for products and services purchased on a Website. 

**Mergers And Acquisitions**

It is possible that FARES, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venture companies, or any combination of them, could merge with or be acquired by another legal entity. In such event, FARES may share PII collected from the Website with such other entity. FARES will notify such other entity of the policy that applies to PII under FARES’s applicable privacy policy. 

**Other Information Sharing**

In addition, we will also share information with third parties in response to a subpoena or when we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or other legal obligation; in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; to protect the security or confidentiality of our records; or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your PII to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission. 

We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and demographic data. 

**Opt Out**

If you do not want FARES or our affiliates to contact you via email regarding special offers or services that we think might interest you, you can choose to discontinue such communication by informing us of your choice on our opt-out page, by following the instructions included in our email or by notifying us in writing at the address below. 

If you do not want FARES to share your PII with third parties, you may discontinue such sharing by informing us of your choice on our opt-out page or by notifying us in writing at the address below.

Please send your opt-out requests to:

First American Real Estate Solutions, L.P.   
Attn: Web Site Security

Alternatively, you may inform us of your choice through our opt-out page.

Please note that we will endeavor to implement your opt-out requests within a reasonable time, although for a time you may continue to receive mailings, etc., transmitted based on information released prior to the implementation of your request. Please also note that even after such request is implemented, you will continue to receive information directly related to the product or service for which you registered (or which you otherwise agreed to receive), so you always are kept informed.

Residents of California have additional privacy rights, which are described further below.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

If you are a California resident, you may request information regarding disclosure of your PII to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [custserv.res.ca@firstam.com](mailto:custserv.res.ca@firstam.com) with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your e-mail address in response. 

Please note we are required to respond to such a customer request only once during the course of any one calendar year.

**Links**

The Websites contains links to other sites, but FARES assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices of these sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links you are moving to a new website. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**Security**

FARES takes reasonable precautions to protect users’ PII, whether it is collected off-line or through the Websites, and to store it securely. 

PII that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted during transmission and is transmitted to us securely. All of our users’ PII is maintained in a reasonably secure computer environment. Access to our customers’ PII is reasonably restricted to prevent unauthorized access. Only employees of FARES, appropriate affiliates and third parties who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to PII. Access is password protected, and employees are advised that the information to which they have access is confidential and must be protected. Finally, the servers on which we store PII are kept in a reasonably secure environment. 

We retain PII collected from the Websites for only as long as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes for which the information was collected. Once such information is no longer required, we take steps to ensure that the information is destroyed in a reasonably secure manner.

If this site requires you to register to access or purchase products, you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information in your profile, including billing address and payment information. You may access and correct your account profile by contacting First American at:
