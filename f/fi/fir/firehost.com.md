**The Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**

Armor may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways, including online and offline subscription and order forms, paper or telephone submissions, and other instances where customers are invited to volunteer such information. Additionally, contact information may be collected during any correspondence relating to customer support, as well as in connection with the Service offered on the Site.  If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Armor may collect such information as contact name, business name and type, address, phone number, email address and billing information including credit card number and expiration date, as well as other information. We will only use your name, address and billing information/credit card information to process your order. The addresses are used for customer support, required notifications, product and statement updates and marketing releases. Under no circumstances will we use this information for anything else not described in this Privacy Statement. All users may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the Unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and customer notices or by submitting a General Inquiry at <https://www.armor.com/company/contact/>.

However, even where a customer has opted out of receiving any marketing data, in order to fulfill our service obligations, Armor will continue to send emails regarding customers’ account administration or interruptions to the Services for system maintenance.

Information will only be made publicly available where mandated by governing agencies, in response to subpoenas, similar legal process or court orders, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or as disclosed in accordance with the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.

**Financial Information**

Whenever customers apply for our services or sign up for any other product or service through Armor, they may be required to submit financial information such as a credit card number and billing address before we will process the application. Armor will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected except as disclosed in this statement or as necessary to fulfill orders.

**Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses**

Armor uses your unique network address and SessionID to help diagnose potential problems with equipment, to help tailor content to match your preferred interests and to otherwise administer the Site.

Armor makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers. Armor has put stringent security procedures in place to protect such information collected about our customers. We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures. Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) connections are used to communicate to our system to protect customer financial information (such as credit card number or bank account information), as well as encrypting vital information that customers input through the Site. Although reasonable efforts are made to secure network communications and the Site, Armor cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Electronic Mail**

Electronic communications may be sent by Armor using customers’ personal contact information to inform them of new products, important industry news or general services and upgrades provided by Armor. If customers do not wish to receive these industry notices, they may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the Unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and customer notices. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations, Armor will continue to send emails regarding customers’ account administration or service interruptions for system maintenance.

Should Armor receive an abuse complaint from any third party, Armor shall have the right to assume that the facts stated in such complaint are accurate and true unless you provide compelling evidence to the contrary. Any such failure to reasonably cooperate with Armor’s investigation of any abuse complaints or suspected breaches of your environment shall constitute a breach of this AUP.

**Reporting Violation of the Acceptable Use Policy**

Armor accepts reports of alleged violations of this AUP via abuse@Armor.com.

Reports of alleged violations should include name, contact information, IP address, and description of the violation. While Armor’s policy is to use commercially reasonable efforts to review all third party reports and take appropriate actions as described within the resolution process set forth below, Armor will neither assume nor owe any duty to any third party that files a report alleging a violation of this AUP.

**Resolution Process for Violations of Armor’s Acceptable Use Policy**

The ultimate goal of this AUP is to balance the rights of our customers with the policies set forth in this AUP. The goal of the Resolution Process described below is to mitigate service interruptions while resolving potential violations of this AUP. Our staff is dedicated to working with the customer in resolving potential violations. The resolution process below provides the process for resolving all potential violations. Timing for resolution differs according to the degree of the violation, the nature of the violation, involvement of law enforcement, involvement of third party litigation, or other related factors. Overall, Armor is dedicated to working with the customer in resolving, where practical, all potential AUP violations prior to any interruption of the Services.

  * **Step 1: Identification of potential AUP violation:**



Armor actively monitors its infrastructure and all Services and may, in the course of monitoring and managing its infrastructure and Services, uncover potential violations of this AUP. AUP violations can also be identified through reports received from third parties as described above **.**

  * **Step 2: Notification and investigation of potential AUP violation:**



A ticket will be generated under the customer’s portal account with information regarding the potential violation of this AUP.

Following the generation of the ticket, Armor will work with the customer to investigate the reported violation and advise remedial actions required to resolve the violation.

Following such investigation, if Armor discovers there has been no violation of this AUP or the remedial actions have been completed by the customer to Armor’s reasonable satisfaction, the applicable ticket will be closed and no further action will be taken.

  * **Step 3: If the reported violation of the AUP is disregarded or not properly addressed:**



If the reported violation of this AUP is disregarded or not properly addressed by the customer, Armor may remove public access to the Services or disable the Services. If Armor takes this step, Armor may allow customer access to the Services via a secure non-public network, if such access is necessary for customer to complete any necessary remedial actions.

As soon as the violation is addressed to Armor’s reasonable satisfaction, either public access to the Services shall be restored or the Services will be enabled.

If the customer will not or cannot resolve the violation of this AUP or fails to participate in Armor’s resolution process, Armor may terminate the Services at its sole discretion.

**Disclaimer: Armor retains the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse new Services to any individual, group, or business. Armor also retains the right to discontinue Services to customers with excessive and/or multiple repeated violations. No credit will be available under any applicable Service Level Agreement for interruptions of the Services resulting from AUP violations.**
