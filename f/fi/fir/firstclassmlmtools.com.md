 **Security & Privacy  
** **How we make shopping safe over the Internet  
** Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor your privacy. Brilliant Exchange™ utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you place an order with Brilliant Exchange your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than a trusted Brilliant Exchange™ customer support team member. 

  **Make the choice that works for you!  
** There is not a right or a wrong way to place an order with Brilliant Exchange™. We gladly accept orders via phone, fax or mail. 

**Toll Free Ordering**  
To place an order by phone, call toll-free 1-888-307-7104, M-F 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. MST. International callers, call 801-374-2188

  **Order by Fax**  
To place an order by fax 24 hours a day, 7 days a week simply complete your order online and when selecting a "method of payment" click the "Personal Check by Mail or Credit Card by Fax" button. This option will collect your shopping cart, shipping information and order total onto a customized order form that can be easily faxed to Brilliant Exchange™. 

  **Order by Mail**  
If you do not have a credit card we accept personal checks and money orders. The process is similar to submitting an order via fax. Simply complete your order online and when selecting a "method of payment" click the "Personal Check by Mail or Credit Card by Fax" button. This option will collect your shopping cart, shipping information and order total onto a customized form that can be easily printed off and mailed into Brilliant Exchange™ with the check or money order. Please note that the bank must clear personal checks before the order is shipped.

**Troubleshooting  
** **Why was my order declined?**  
Most declined orders caused by: 

  * _Invalid credit card number:_ The credit card number or expiration date submitted included at least one incorrect digit. Thus resulting in a declined status. Please re-submit your credit card number again.   
 
  * _Bill-to address does not match address on file with credit card issuer:_ One security feature helping prevent credit card fraud is the requirement by merchant processors that the submitted bill-to address for the given order correctly matches the bill-to address the credit card issuer has on file. While this extra step takes added time the result is a more secure ordering environment.   
 
  * _Order total exceeds current credit limit:_ Oftentimes, in addition to the time it takes to mail in your credit card payment, the credit card company needs a couple days to process it and post your updated credit balance. Therefore, your submitted order could exceed your current balance. Please call your credit card issuer to determine your credit balance.  
 
  * _Credit card has expired:_ The expiration date on credit cards can easily come and go. The expiration date that you thought would never expire just did. Your replacement card is most likely on its way. To complete your order either submit a different card or utilize our "Check or Money Order" option in the "Select a Payment Method" section of the checkout process.  
 
  * _Internet connection "timed-out:"_ Just like our local freeways the Internet can be slowed down during "peak" traffic periods. The slowdown can also be magnified with a slow dial-up connection. These two factors could lead to a "timed-out" error and can be easily resolved by either placing the order another time or calling our toll-free order line at (888) 307-7104. 



  
**Why doesn't a shipping charge appear?  
** If shipping charges do not appear please check the zip code for the ship-to address. All shipping charges are generated by order weight and zip code. If the zip code is correct contact [support by email](mailto:support@brilliantexchange.com) or call Customer Support at (888) 307-7104. **When will my backordered items ship?  
** All backordered items will ship within one business day after the item becomes available
