# FirstMerit Privacy and Security Principles

It's always been FirstMerit's top priority to protect our customers' privacy and security rigorously. Rest assured that we will not sell your customer information to non-FirstMerit companies. We consider it a privilege that you have chosen to entrust us with your financial business, and we do not jeopardize that precious relationship by sharing customer information. Protecting your privacy is a responsibility that we welcome. 

**1\. Recognition of Customer's Expectation of Privacy**  
FirstMerit recognizes and respects that our customers have expectations of privacy. In order to serve you and provide you with a wide range of products, it is necessary that you provide us with information about your personal and financial affairs. We work hard to assure that such information is used in accordance with these Privacy and Security Principles. 

**2\. Collection, Use and Retention of Customer Information**  
FirstMerit collects, uses and retains information about customers only when we believe it is useful and legal. This information is used to transact business with you, provide products, services and other opportunities to you, and comply with any legal requirements. 

**3\. Maintenance of Accurate Information**  
FirstMerit strives to maintain accurate information regarding our customers. We have practices in place to help assure that the information we have about you and your account is accurate, current and complete. While we recognize that errors can and do occur, we promise to respond to requests to correct erroneous information in a timely manner. If you believe any information we have on file for you is inaccurate, please contact us at 1-888-554-4362. 

**4\. Limiting Employee Access to Information**  
FirstMerit makes available only the information necessary for our employees to perform their job responsibilities. We require all employees to affirmatively acknowledge that customer information is confidential by including it in our Employee Code of Ethics. 

**5\. Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures**  
FirstMerit is committed to safeguarding customer information from unauthorized access. We recognize that customers are concerned about access to their information by unscrupulous firms or individuals. We have procedures and technology in place to help prevent such unauthorized access. 

**6\. Restriction on the Disclosure of Account Information**  
FirstMerit shall not disclose confidential information regarding its customers except as authorized or requested by its customers or as allowed or required by law. In the course of conducting our business, we may be required to disclose information regarding you or your account outside the FirstMerit family, or you may request us to disclose information to a third party. We will comply with such information disclosures with due consideration. 

**7\. Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties**  
If customer information must be released to a third party for servicing or other reasons, that third party will be expected to keep any such information confidential. Third parties that we deal with must also be committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and must abide by applicable law. 

  
FirstMerit recognizes the need to protect the confidentiality of the information that you provide and that may be viewed via the Internet. For that reason, we have adopted the following Principles for Internet banking. 

**Your User Name and Password**  
Access to your account information via the Internet and the ability to complete transactions on your account is possible only with your valid user name and password combination. Your user name and password should be treated with the same care and confidentiality as your ATM card or debit card and PIN combination. You should avoid saving your password on your computer's hard drive to prevent someone from gaining access to your account via the Internet. You should also use a unique user name and password for your Internet banking account. Please note that FirstMerit will never ask you for your password. If you ever believe your user name and password have been misused, you should notify us at once by calling 1-888-554-4362, by sending us an e-mail at [customerservice@firstmerit.com](mailto:customerservice@firstmerit.com), or by writing to us at: 

FirstMerit Bank N.A.  
Customer Service  
295 FirstMerit Circle   
Akron, Ohio 44307. 

If sending an e-mail, do not include any confidential information. 

**Encryption**  
Information you provide us or that we provide you, and any instructions you make to us via our Internet banking service are encrypted. This means that the information shared between your browser and FirstMerit is scrambled using an algorithm and then decoded once it is received by us or by you using a decoder that is stored in your browser. We use, and require you to use and receive, 128-bit encryption. Note that e-mail communication is not encrypted in this manner. Do not send confidential information or instructions to us via e-mail. For more information, read the following section regarding e-mail. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are bits of data that many companies operating on the Internet, including ours, use to identify you when you visit their Web site.   
FirstMerit uses cookies to make your use of our site more enjoyable and efficient. Cookies consist of bits of data placed into your Web browser that allow us to identify you, tailor our offerings to you and speed up your experience with us whenever your log in to use FirstMerit Internet banking. Cookies do not harm your hard drive or your system. You can personalize your browser to refrain from accepting cookies or to notify you when one will be sent. However, doing so may slow down your experience with that Web site and may make certain pages unavailable to you. 

**E-mail**  
E-mail communications between you and us are not encrypted, as are communications through FirstMerit's Internet banking service. For that reason, you should refrain from sending us confidential information via e-mail. We will likewise refrain from sending you confidential information using this method. If you wish to communicate confidential information to us, you can send us a secured message through the Internet banking site, which will be encrypted as described in the above section. 

**Logging Out**  
It is recommended that you completely log out of the FirstMerit Internet banking service and close all instances of your browser when you finish transacting business with us. This will prevent an unauthorized user from obtaining access to your information while your connection is still open. 

If you do not perform any activity while you are connected to the FirstMerit Internet banking service for more than 15 minutes, you will be logged out automatically. 

**Firewalls**  
FirstMerit uses firewalls to protect the integrity of your information and of the transactions you perform. 

**Viruses**  
We take precautions against computer viruses by constantly scanning our site for viruses. It is recommended that you use one of the commercially available software applications to do the same with your computer. 

If you would like additional information or have any questions about these Principles, please contact us by calling 1-888-554-4362 or by sending us an e-mail message. 

**These FirstMerit Privacy and Security Principles do not constitute a contract and may be revised from time to time.**
