# First-School's Privacy Policy

  
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.  However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider people use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example).  This helps us to determine what our pages will look like on your browser (in an attempt to make sure the templates and other images are viewable and printable for everyone).  For example, this information may tell us that 30% of the people who visit use a certain type of browser and 25% of the people who visit us use Windows 95, etc, not what one specific visitor uses. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific request or email conversation (example, your name as a signature on an email).  This is completely your choice and is not a requirement in corresponding with us.  Again, if you do chose to share this information, we do not sell or give this information to anyone.
