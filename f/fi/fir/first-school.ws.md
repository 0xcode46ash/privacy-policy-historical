# First-School's Privacy Policy

  | 

  
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.  However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider people use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example).  This helps us to determine what our pages will look like on your browser (in an attempt to make sure the templates and other images are viewable and printable for everyone).  For example, this information may tell us that 30% of the people who visit use a certain type of browser and 25% of the people who visit us use Windows 95, etc, not what one specific visitor uses. 

Your email address will be collected if you chose to subscribe to our upcoming free newsletter.  Your email address will not be provided to anyone else (for free or for sale).  We will simply use the email address to send you weekly notification of new information added to First-School. 

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific request or email conversation (example, your name as a signature on an email).  This is completely your choice and is not a requirement in corresponding with us.  Again, if you do chose to share this information, we do not sell or give this information to anyone.

This site, First-School, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to http://www.engage.com/privacy.
