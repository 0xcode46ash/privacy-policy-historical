## FireEye Online Privacy Statement

FireEye respects your privacy. When using our website, you may get information, communicate with us, or link to other websites with whom we do business. While doing this, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you, as well as personalize your experience on our Website. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Individual Identifying Information that you share with us. "Individual Identifying Information" is information that enables us to identify you. Examples of this kind of information include your email address, name, title, or mailing address, and there are other similar kinds of information that may be used for the same purpose.

Your privacy, and the privacy of all users of www.fireeye.com, is of the highest priority. If you have any questions, [please email us](https://web.archive.org/company/contact.html). We will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13 without parental consent.

This policy governs websites owned and operated by FireEye. Our policy does not govern websites of other parties to which we may provide links because FireEye is not responsible, and cannot control the privacy practices or content of those sites.

Here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our websites:

  * Information Collection and Use
  * Information Sharing and Disclosure
  * Questions or Suggestions
  * IP Information Collection and Use Practices
  * Cookies
  * Data Storage
  * Contact Us



#### Information Collection and Use

  * FireEye collects Individual Identifying Information when you register for FireEye information or webcasts, visit FireEye pages, and enter promotions. FireEye may also receive Individual Identifying Information from our business partners.
  * FireEye also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, FireEye cookie information, and the page(s) you requested.
  * FireEye uses information for these general purposes: to fulfill your requests for information on products and services and to contact you about offers and new products.



#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * FireEye will not sell or rent your Individual Identifying Information to anyone.
  * FireEye will send Individual Identifying Information about you to other companies or people when: 
    * We have your consent to share the information;
    * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
    * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of FireEye to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Individual Identifying Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.)



#### Questions or Suggestions

If you have questions or suggestions [complete a feedback form](https://web.archive.org/company/contact.html) or send an email to [info@fireeye.com.](mailto:%20info@fireeye.com)

#### IP Information Collection and Use Practices

  * FireEye receives IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a Web page.
  * When a FireEye Web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.
  * IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including estimating the total number of users visiting FireEye from specific countries or regions of the world.



#### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and is stored on your computer's hard drive.

Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

_FireEye Practices Regarding Cookies_  
FireEye uses cookies for a number of purposes, including to:

  * Provide you with customized content.
  * Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using FireEye's products and services.
  * Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.
  * Conduct research to improve FireEye content and services.
  * Require you to reenter your FireEye password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you.



In addition to the first-party cookies we set, we use external services that set third-party cookies to:

  * Enable information sharing across social media services.
  * Provide you with targeted advertising in relevant contexts on external sites.
  * Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using third-party services.
  * Enable third parties to aggregate anonymous user behavior data and provide such research data to FireEye.
  * Monitor and report on site and service usage across FireEye websites.
  * Query third-party services such as Twitter for recently changed information.



_Similar Technologies We Use_  
In addition to cookies, we use Web beacons (also known as "clear GIFs" and "1x1" pixels) and coded URLs. These techniques may be used:

  * In online advertising to determine which advertisements you have viewed.
  * In our promotional emails to track whether an email has been viewed and subsequent clicks on hyperlinks.
  * To support remarketing for AdWords Ads on the Google Display Network. Remarketing technology serves you ads across multiple websites based on your browsing interest and behavior.



To opt out of Web beacon tracking, choose "DECLINE" on the FireEye Cookie Preferences control at the bottom of this page. Note that this will disable all first-party cookie sources from www.fireeye.com. In addition, you may choose not to open emails or download images in emails you receive from FireEye.

To opt out of tracking via coded URLs, you may choose not to click on hyperlinks embedded in marketing emails you receive from FireEye.

  * <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>
  * <http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/cookieoptout.html>



**Controlling Cookies via the FireEye Cookie Preferences Control**

FireEye provides a control that allows you to disable first-party cookies and Web beacon tracking on www.fireeye.com. The control has two settings:

  * ACCEPT: With this setting, all cookies and Web beacons are delivered normally.
  * DECLINE: With this setting, first-party cookies and Web beacons are not delivered from www.fireeye.com.



FireEye has multiple websites comprising its web presence, and the Cookie Preferences Control only affects first-party cookies and Web beacons sourced from www.fireeye.com.

  * When you transition to other sites, this privacy policy no longer applies, and the privacy policy of the other sites come into effect.
  * When browsing a site other than www.fireeye.com, FireEye recommends that you check the privacy policy local to that site to determine how it might affect you. 



Note: The FireEye Cookie Preferences Control setting is specific to the web browser used to adjust the setting. If you browse the www.fireeye.com site using a different web browser application, or a different device, you will need to select your preferred setting again.

#### Data Storage

_Account Information_

  * When you submit information to FireEye, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human error.
  * Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases.



_Servers_

  * The FireEye computers (called "servers") that send your Web pages process and store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called "log files."
  * Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your FireEye ID may remain in our active server log files.
