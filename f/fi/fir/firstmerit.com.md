****FirstMerit Privacy and Security Principles  
****Our Commitment To Protecting Your Privacy**

**We Strive to Fulfill Your Trust … Every Day**  
You can be confident in the trust you have placed in FirstMerit. We honor that trust and strive to return it by offering you financial security, backed by the highest quality products and services. 

Information is at the heart of our ability to deliver the value-added, personalized service you deserve. You have a right to know what information we gather about you, and how we use it to enhance the convenience and quality of our services.

**Our Commitment To Protecting Your Privacy**  
Following is the Privacy Policy for the FirstMerit affiliated companies listed on the back, of which you are a customer, and with which you may have a relationship in the future. This Policy also applies to future FirstMerit affiliated companies. In this Policy, "we," "us," or "our" means the FirstMerit entity(ies) with which you have a relationship, and "you" or "your" means the individual customer who has the relationship. FirstMerit has adopted this Policy to inform you of the confidentiality with which we treat personally identifiable financial information of individual consumers (also referred to as "nonpublic personal information" or "customer information").

**Your Information Is Safe With Us**  
We have implemented this Policy throughout the FirstMerit family to ensure the security and accuracy of all customer information. This Policy applies to current and former customers. Our operating and data processing environments are highly secure, and we maintain strict physical and electronic safeguards wherever customer information is used or stored. In addition, our employees are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of any customer information. FirstMerit's Code of Ethics requires all employees to affirmatively acknowledge that all customer information is to remain confidential. We comply with all applicable federal regulations in safeguarding customer information. 

**Information Is Used To Enhance Our Service**  
There are many ways customer information helps us enhance the quality and value of our services. For example, it enables us to:

> · Verify your identity to protect your accounts and balances  
>  · Make it faster and more convenient for you to open new accounts, apply for loans, and conduct other types of transactions  
>  · Respond to your inquiries promptly, and with more complete information  
>  · Identify and recommend additional services that may save you time and money  
>  · Tailor our products and services more closely to your financial needs  
>  · Develop new services to serve your needs even better

**Information Collection**  
At FirstMerit, we collect customer information to better serve you and administer your accounts. We collect, use and retain information about you where we believe that doing so is required to operate our business; where it will help us to provide a better selection of products, services, and other benefits to you; or where doing so is permitted by law. This includes information you provide on forms or electronically when you open an account or apply for a loan (such as your income and assets) … records of your transactions within the FirstMerit family or with others (such as your account balance, payment history and credit card usage) … information to complete transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. … information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as credit score or credit history) … information we may need to carry out the terms of agreements we have with you … and information that is part of the public record.

**How We Share Information Within Our FirstMerit Family  
**As we process transactions, administer your accounts and open new accounts, customer information as described above in the Information Collection section may be disclosed to other members of the FirstMerit family, including current and future affiliates such as FirstMerit Mortgage Corporation, FirstMerit Securities, Inc., Abell & Associates, Inc., and FirstMerit Insurance Agency, Inc. These disclosures are made to enhance the array of products and services available to you and to better help you meet your financial goals. If you prefer not to take advantage of such opportunities and not have your customer information disclosed within the FirstMerit family, you may "opt out" (that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures and we will not do so) by calling us toll-free at 866-353-0020. Please note that if you choose to opt out, certain information may still be disclosed to FirstMerit companies, as permitted by law. 

**How We Share Selected Information With Third Parties**

**Sharing With Joint Marketing And Customer Service Companies**  
In order to provide you with offers of beneficial financial products and services, we may disclose customer information as described above in the Information Collection section to companies who perform joint marketing or customer services for us. This may include companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Such companies are obligated contractually to keep customer information confidential and to comply with our confidentiality rules and policies. These companies are prohibited from using customer information for any purpose other than the purpose for which we've contracted.

**Sharing With Other Non-FirstMerit Companies**  
To better serve your needs, we may also disclose customer information as described above in the Information Collection section to non-affiliated financial service providers or non-financial companies such as companies that offer products and services that we believe may be beneficial to you. Such disclosure of selected information allows us to partner with companies who have a specific financial expertise so we can offer you a wider array of products and services. Such companies are obligated contractually to keep customer information confidential and to comply with our confidentiality rules and policies. These companies are prohibited from using customer information for any purpose other than the purpose for which we've contracted. If you prefer not to have your customer information disclosed to non-FirstMerit companies, you may "opt out" (that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures and we will not do so) by calling us toll-free at 866-353-0020. Please note that if you choose to opt out, certain information may still be disclosed to third parties as permitted by law, including information to companies providing joint marketing or customer services. 

**Joint Accounts**  
If any of your accounts or relationships with us are held jointly with another person(s), we will treat a request to opt out of either affiliated or third party sharing by any of the joint owners to be a prohibition on sharing of all information related to all of the parties for that account. However, if the other joint account owners want to opt out for any accounts not held jointly with you, they must exercise their opt out separately.

**Privacy Policy Amendments**  
This Policy may be amended from time to time. When legally required, we will send you written notice of any amendments prior to the time they become effective.

This Privacy Policy applies to the following FirstMerit Companies:

FirstMerit Bank, N.A.

**How Can We Help You Today?**  
FirstMerit is dedicated to offering you choices -- and respecting the choices you make -- every day. We look forward to continuing to offer you banking and financial services that deliver convenience, savings, value and security. 

**Internet Banking Privacy and Security **  
FirstMerit recognizes the need to protect the confidentiality of the information that you provide and that may be viewed via the Internet. For that reason, we have adopted the following Principles for Internet banking. 

**Your User Name and Password**  
Access to your account information via the Internet and the ability to complete transactions on your account is possible only with your valid user name and password combination. Your user name and password should be treated with the same care and confidentiality as your ATM card or debit card and PIN combination. You should avoid saving your password on your computer's hard drive to prevent someone from gaining access to your account via the Internet. You should also use a unique user name and password for your Internet banking account. Please note that FirstMerit will never ask you for your password. If you ever believe your user name and password have been misused, you should notify us at once by calling 1-888-554-4362, by sending us an e-mail at [customerservice@firstmerit.com](mailto:customerservice@firstmerit.com), or by writing to us at: 

FirstMerit Bank NA  
Customer Service  
295 FirstMerit Circle   
Akron, Ohio 44307. 

If sending an e-mail, do not include any confidential information. 

**Encryption**  
Information you provide us or that we provide you, and any instructions you make to us via our Internet banking service are encrypted. This means that the information shared between your browser and FirstMerit is scrambled using an algorithm and then decoded once it is received by us or by you using a decoder that is stored in your browser. We use, and require you to use and receive, 128-bit encryption. Note that e-mail communication is not encrypted in this manner. Do not send confidential information or instructions to us via e-mail. For more information, read the following section regarding e-mail. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are bits of data that many companies operating on the Internet, including ours, use to identify you when you visit their Web site.   
FirstMerit uses cookies to make your use of our site more enjoyable and efficient. Cookies consist of bits of data placed into your Web browser that allow us to identify you, tailor our offerings to you and speed up your experience with us whenever your log in to use FirstMerit Internet banking. Cookies do not harm your hard drive or your system. You can personalize your browser to refrain from accepting cookies or to notify you when one will be sent. However, doing so may slow down your experience with that Web site and may make certain pages unavailable to you. 

**E-mail**  
E-mail communications between you and us are not encrypted, as are communications through FirstMerit's Internet banking service. For that reason, you should refrain from sending us confidential information via e-mail. We will likewise refrain from sending you confidential information using this method. If you wish to communicate confidential information to us, you can send us a secured message through the Internet banking site, which will be encrypted as described in the above section. 

**Logging Out**  
It is recommended that you completely log out of the FirstMerit Internet banking service and close all instances of your browser when you finish transacting business with us. This will prevent an unauthorized user from obtaining access to your information while your connection is still open. 

If you do not perform any activity while you are connected to the FirstMerit Internet banking service for more than 15 minutes, you will be logged out automatically. 

**Firewalls**  
FirstMerit uses firewalls to protect the integrity of your information and of the transactions you perform. 

**Viruses**  
We take precautions against computer viruses by constantly scanning our site for viruses. It is recommended that you use one of the commercially available software applications to do the same with your computer. 

If you would like additional information or have any questions about these Principles, please contact us by calling 1-888-554-4362 or by sending us an e-mail message. 

**These FirstMerit Internet Banking Privacy and Security Principles do not constitute a contract and may be revised from time to time.**
