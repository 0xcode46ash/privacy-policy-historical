# Train tickets - Cheap rail tickets online | First Capital Connect

This Privacy Policy refers to information we obtain about you and the use we make of it in the course of our business.

_1\. When I visit your website, what information do you gather about me?_

One of the basic principles we have followed in designing this website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our website and the growing list of website services.

Currently website users provide information in order to take advantage of the following services:

_User Accounts:_ Name, address, phone, e-mail, photo ID card and Season Ticket details are necessary for most web services. Journey information allows us to present relevant train service information effectively. Please note our licence requires us to maintain a record of all season ticket holders.

_Promotional Offers:_ if you wish us to supply this to you we need contact details and delivery preferences. 

_2\. Will you ever disclose my data to any other organisations?_

The information you provide to us will be held on our server in the United Kingdom and may be accessed by or given to our staff and to third parties including our group companies and business partners (such as our web agency, database management company and, government bodies and law enforcement agencies, successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. Those parties process information, fulfil and deliver orders, process credit card payments and provide support and other services on our behalf. We may also:

  * disclose personal information you have provided through our Site to persons or companies that we retain to carry out promotions and other activities for which you have registered or in which you have otherwise asked to participate;
  * pass aggregate information on the usage of our Site (e.g. we might disclose the median ages of visitors to our Site, or the numbers of visitors to our Site that come from different geographic areas) to third parties but this will not include information that can be used to identify you personally;
  * allow carefully selected third parties, including other companies in our group, to contact you occasionally about products and services which may be of interest to you (where you have consented to us doing so). They may contact you by post, telephone or fax, as well as by e-mail. If you change your mind about being contacted by these companies in the future, please let us or them know.



Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.

Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.

Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent.

_3\. What are cookies and do you use them?_

Cookies are small tags, stored in your browser, which allow us to identify you as you move through the site. They often include an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

It is very common for sites do this whenever a user visits the site in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies also record information about your online preferences. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Choosing the last of these options means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features available on our website. 

For more information on how cookies are used on our site, please see our [cookies policy](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/contact-us/cookies-policy/). For further information on cookies, and how to delete them from your device, please visit [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/) or [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), or check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

_4\. How can I amend the data I have supplied to you?_

You can manage your details via the Your Account section or, alternatively, contact Customer Relations - [customer.relations.fcc@firstgroup.com](mailto:customer.relations.fcc@firstgroup.com)

_5\. Can you make changes to this policy?_

There may be developments in how we use your data. Any changes will be notified to you by the updating of this policy.
