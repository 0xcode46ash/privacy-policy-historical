### Privacy Policy

Any personal data (for example, your name, address, telephone number or email address) that you transmit to First Capital Connect's website by electronic mail or otherwise will be stored by First Capital Connect. If you have opted in to receive information from First Capital Connect, your personal data will be used to determine what information you are sent, and how. 

We may share your personal information with other FirstGroup companies, but we will not pass on your details to any third party, other than for transmitting information that you have requested.

Any other communication or material you transmit to the Site, such as questions, comments, suggestions or the like, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and First Capital Connect will use them as it wishes.

First Capital Connect makes use of a user's IP address, or other session information that is automatically captured by our web server, under the following circumstances:

  1. where a user chooses to tell us whether they are a commuter, leisure or business traveller (in order to direct them to appropriate information on the site)
  2. where a user chooses to tell us which is their local station (in order for train running information to be displayed)

Cookies are used for collecting this user information from the site.




Customers who use their employers email system to register for any services provided by FCC, will be deemed to have the appropriate authority/permissions to use these systems.

First Capital Connect may stop sending emails to your address without notifying you, even if you have subscribed to receive them, if we receive a request from your employer or educational establishment (or otherwise) to stop sending emails to that address.
