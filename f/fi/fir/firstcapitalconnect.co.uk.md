# Train tickets - Cheap rail tickets online | First Capital Connect

This Privacy Policy refers to information we obtain about you and the use we make of it in the course of our business.

_1\. When I visit your website, what information do you gather about me?_

One of the basic principles we have followed in designing this website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our website and the growing list of website services.

Currently website users provide information in order to take advantage of the following services:

_User Accounts:_ Name, address, phone, e-mail, photo ID card and Season Ticket details are necessary for most web services. Journey information allows us to present relevant train service information effectively. Please note our licence requires us to maintain a record of all season ticket holders.

_Promotional Offers:_ if you wish us to supply this to you we need contact details and delivery preferences. 

_2\. Will you ever disclose my data to any other organisations?_

We may share your personal information with other FirstGroup companies, but we will not pass on your details to any third party, other than for transmitting information that you have requested.

_3\. What are cookies and do you use them?_

Cookies are small tags, stored in your browser, which allow us to identify you as you move through the site. They often include an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

It is very common for sites do this whenever a user visits the site in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies also record information about your online preferences. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Choosing the last of these options means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features available on our website. 

For more information on how cookies are used on our site, please see our [cookies policy](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/contact-us/cookies-policy/). For further information on cookies, and how to delete them from your device, please visit [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/) or [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), or check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

_4\. How can I amend the data I have supplied to you?_

You can manage your details via the Your Account section or, alternatively, contact Customer Relations - [customer.relations.fcc@firstgroup.com](mailto:customer.relations.fcc@firstgroup.com)

_5\. Can you make changes to this policy?_

There may be developments in how we use your data. Any changes will be notified to you by the updating of this policy.
