## Privacy 

Filmtrailer.com receives statistical information about the visitors of the website, specifically the number of film trailers watched by users. It is not possible on the basis of these information to recognize individual persons and it is a process we practice in order to improve filmtrailer.com and the quality and quantity of the new film trailers. 

When you browse the Internet you leave an “electronic trace” which reveals where you have been and which browser you have. This trace is created because your browser sends information to a server. While your browser is requesting filmtrailer.com it is also sending some other information to the particular server among other things your address (IP-address on the Internet) so that the server knows whereto it must return the page you have requested. Depending on the operating system and the browser you are using the browser often sends your username to the server as well. It is the username you use when you log on to your computer. 

When you have visited filmtrailer.com’s website we will therefore know the following about you: 

\- Which pages you have looked at, and when

\- Which browser you are using

\- Your IP-address

\- Which film trailers you watched

\- How many of movie trailers you watched

\- In some cases your username

By using this information we can trace the route you use when you search for information on filmtrailer.com. In example we can see whether you start off from the front-page and move down to the sub-pages or whether you jump into the middle of the website from a search engine or from one of our partners. Your personal information which is entered in connection to filling out profiles and so forth on filmtrailer.com or related services will be stored discretely. 

Filmtrailer.com handles all personal information confidentially and in accordance with common marketing practices and The Danish Data Protection Agency’s guidelines regarding the storage and usage of data. The information will never be resold – it will only be shared with business partners in the marketing of relevant products and services.
