filmcritic.com Privacy Policy

  
Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to filmcritic.com. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find below a description of how filmcritic.com strives to protect the privacy of Internet users. 

**User Information**

filmcritic.com does not collect personal information about its users with the exception of e-mail addresses used for opt-in, e-mailed movie reviews. Subscribers to our newsletter are free to cancel their subscriptions at any time. At no time does filmcritic.com acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address all remain your private properties.

filmcritic.com's advertisers do, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Our advertisers' servers note _non-personally identifying details_ such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of filmcritic.com clients and customers. 

There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, the advertiser acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. This information is used by the client so the user can receive the goods or services requested. When requested, the advertiser may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads. 

We occasionally send promotional messages about the site to our newsletter subscribers. Just a few each year, and again, we _never_ share your e-mail address with third parties.

We also offer a voluntary user survey in which you may, at your sole discretion, provide non-personally identifying demographic information about yourself. This is strictly optional, does not contain any name, address, or e-mail information, and is used only in the aggregate.

**Cookies**

When you are first served a filmcritic.com ad, the advertiser may temporarily store some codes within your browser that allows us to respond properly to the ads that we deliver. These codes are commonly known as "cookies". For example, these codes let the advertiser keep track of how many times you view an ad on our site. It also helps us determine where to send you when you click on an ad. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 

**Third-Party Measurement Services**

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party ad serving service for managing and tracking the performance of an ad program.In these instances, filmcritic.com has no control over the information collected by the third-parties, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned.

Please be aware that filmcritic.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

filmcritic.com openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence [here](mailto:null@filmcritic.com).
