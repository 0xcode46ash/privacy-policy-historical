# Privacy Policy - filecloud.io

In the modern age of mass internet surveilance and tracking we at filecloud.io understand that Privacy is important, hence this "no bullshit" document is kept short and to the point: 

**Information collected by filecloud.io:**

  * Email address you use to register with. 
    * filecloud.io will never send any promotional emails to your address
    * Your email address will only be used in cases of: account recovery, top-up notifications, low credit notifications, very important site updates
  * File information related to the files you upload such as your ip address on upload, filenames, filesizes etc.
  * Timestamp, ip address, country, file_id of each file your download is kept for a duration of 24 hours in order for the temporary download ticket URLs to work.
  * Any support tickets you open.
  * Any copyright notices received
  * Your topup history



The above information is the absolute minimum required for the system to function.   
This data will not be sold or given to any third parties. 

* * *

**Information collected when you purchase credits:**   
You can purchase __credits only using payment methods which guarantee your financial security and privacy such as Amazon.com gift vouchers, Bitcoin and Webmoney.   
This is done deliberately so as to protect your privacy, cut out payment fees and remove various middlemen such as PayPal and Credit Card providers who love nothing better than collect tons of information about you and your purchasing habits and sell it to the highest bidder. 

* * *

**Information collected by 3rd parties:**   
Third parties such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html) and/or [Advertising](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/) providers might collect further information during your visit. You are free to block these services.   
NSA will also most likely attempt record every fart you make on the internet, nothing we can do about that (HTTPS/SSL is used by this site where possible!). If you have read this far well done and thank you for caring about privacy!
