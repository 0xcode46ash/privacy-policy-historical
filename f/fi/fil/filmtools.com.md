When sensitive information is received, we redirect visitors to a secure server page. While on a secure page, such as your account information or the order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Safari becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just surfing.
