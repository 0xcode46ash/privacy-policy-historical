Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

Information Collected: The types of personal information we collect include all the information entered on the Order Form pages: shipping and billing name and address, email address, phone number and credit card information. We collect this information from you using the Yahoo! Store hosting and backend services.

Uses of Information: We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or to provide services where the outside party is acting on our behalf and has no independent right to use the information we provide (i.e. a third party shipping or customer support center).

We use aggregate information to better design our website and to share with potential business partners. For example, we may tell a potential partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of people from a certain zip code purchased certain items, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

We may contact you from time to time regarding your order status or about products or specials that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, we will honor your request not to send them to you.

We use return email addresses from your email correspondence to us to answer the email we receive. Such addresses from your correspondence are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to tell us not to allow such unrelated uses.

Children's Privacy: Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information from our online store from those we actually know are under the age of 13.

Data Security: To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Relationship to Yahoo!: As a Yahoo! Store merchant, our store is hosted on Yahoo! Store's servers and our orders are processed using Yahoo! Store's shopping cart. Yahoo! Store's servers capture IP address, browser type, and referring URL, which is transmitted by your browser.

In addition, certain personal and order information from registered Yahoo! users who access this store through Yahoo! Shopping may be provided to Yahoo!. This is disclosed to you during the checkout process. If you do not want Yahoo! to use this information, you can "sign-out" of Yahoo! before completing your order. Yahoo! may also use information from Yahoo! Store merchants in the aggregate.

Yahoo! Store uses cookies to facilitate the checkout process. If you choose to change your browser preferences to disable cookies, you will still be able to make purchases at our store but you will be limited in the number of items you can purchase at one time. In addition, Yahoo! Store provides tools for merchants, which utilize IP addresses, in order to enable us to see how customers shopped at our store.

Yahoo! Store uses secure servers to protect all of your personal information including your name, address and credit card information. As a Yahoo! Store, our Yahoo! Store enabled checkout process uses industry-standard SSL encryption to ensure the privacy and security of your information. (Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.)

Access and Data Correction: You can access and correct your order and contact information by contacting us. You can also access your order history on Yahoo! Shopping if you are a registered Yahoo! user.

Contact Information: Should you have other questions or concerns about this our privacy policies, please return to our store (using your browser's "BACK" button) and contact us directly using the contact information posted there.
