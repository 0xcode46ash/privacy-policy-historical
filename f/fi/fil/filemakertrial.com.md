##  Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information 

Cookies are used at this website. A “cookie” is a small text file that contains a string of letters, numbers and characters. Internet browsers store “persistent cookies,” like those set by FileMakerTrial.com, in a folder on your computer where they remain until the cookies expire or you delete them. In addition to cookies that www.filemakertrial.com sets itself, some vendors that we use set their own cookies on our behalf. We use the information obtained from cookies to help us understand website activity. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. 

This website also employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that helps us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website visitors. We also use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information. 

One of the vendors we use helps us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy by analyzing the information contained in our log files. Log file data include information that is generally available in Internet transmissions, like your operating system and browser type. 

##  Email 

We use a third party’s technology to send you follow-up emails. Web beacons and cookies are used in those email messages and at our website to help us measure the effectiveness of our communications. In some of our email messages to you, we use a "click-through URL." When you click one of these URLs, you may pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We may track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. 

##  Information Sharing or Disclosure 

Information that you submit to this website may be shared with other FileMaker, Inc. divisions, and among any affiliates, but will not be transferred to unrelated third parties unless we have your permission to do so. Please note, however, that your personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to law. Also, if all or part of the company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the information that you have provided at this website may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, we will take reasonable steps to assure that such information is used in a manner consistent with the privacy policy under which it was collected. 

##  Security 

We have implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with these procedures. Please note, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. 

##  Links to Other Sites 

This website may contain links to other sites, for example, the FileMaker.com website. The other sites may collect and use your information differently from this website, and will have their own privacy policies.

If we make any material or substantive changes in the way that we treat the information collected at this website ([www.filemakertrial.com](http://www.filemakertrial.com/)), we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of these changes on the website and in this privacy policy.
