# Filinet - The Complete Affiliate Marketing Solution

>   
>  Filinet is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitor's personally identifiable information. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at our site. ****
> 
> **What Information We Collect and How We Use It :**
> 
> **Personally Identifiable Information**
> 
> When you place an order for products or services we collect certain types of personally identifiable information including (1) contact information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number; (2) credit card and ID verification information, such as credit card number.
> 
> We use this information to process requests for products and services. We also use collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you (through e-mails and newsletters) about updates to products, to send you order confirmations, or to provide you with important product warranty or safety information. 
> 
> In addition, we use contact information you provide to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
> 
> **Supplementation of Information**
> 
> We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside records (e.g., information from our Strategic Partners or from wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
> 
> **Sharing of Your information**
> 
> Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Filinet. 
> 
> In addition, if you access FILINET through a third-party site, such as one of our Strategic Partners' sites, we also may need to report certain personally identifiable information (e.g., name and e-mail address) back to that Web site. As we explain further below in the section that follows, we will tell you at the point of collection if we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic Partner through which you access the FILINET service. 
> 
> In addition, we will share aggregated demographic information with our Strategic Partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 
> 
> **Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Web Site**
> 
> To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with many of the best service and content companies. As a result of these relationships, you can access FILINET through a third-party Web site. You can recognize most of the FILINET pages on these third-party sites by looking for the joint branding of FILINET and a third-party company. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by FILINET," you are on a co-branded page. 
> 
> Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you access FILINET. If personally identifiable information may be provided to such a third party, we will inform you at the point of collection and provide you with an opportunity to tell us not to share your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover their use of information

> 
> We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze service usage.
