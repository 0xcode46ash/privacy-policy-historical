**GameSpy Industries Privacy Policy - An Overview**

GameSpy is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services and of visitors to its site. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, ensure that kids' information is protected. 

All references in this policy to "GameSpy" include the GameSpy site, member-sites of the GameSpy Network, operated by GameSpy Industries, Inc. and all of the other Internet-accessible GameSpy-branded services. The purpose of this GameSpy privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to GameSpy, (1) what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit GameSpy; (2) how we may use that information; (3) whether we disclose it to anyone; and (4) the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to GameSpy and Web sites that carry the GameSpy brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link or assist in the distribution of their software. We have clearly marked GameSpy and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. 

GameSpy welcomes comments and questions on this policy. GameSpy is dedicated to protecting your personal information. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the technologies GameSpy uses to communicate with you, we may occasionally update this policy. Notice of any revisions will be posted to this site. Any comments or questions regarding our privacy practices should be sent to privacy@gamespy.com. 

**What personal information does GameSpy collect?**

GameSpy collects personally identifying information during: (i) events, sweepstakes, contest or promotion registration; (ii) subscription registration; (iii) user surveys; and (iv) registration for certain interactive areas on GameSpy and on Web sites that carry the GameSpy brand, where visitors also provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., community postings, voting, chat, or bulletin boards). 

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes and we collect that visitor's domain name and e-mail address (where possible). In addition, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses of those who make postings to our chat areas, aggregate information about which pages visitors access, user-specific information about which pages visitors access and how much time is spent in particular areas, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information provided in site registration forms, including but not limited to a visitor's name, address, and phone number. GameSpy also may record audio conversations or copy text chat or video images from chat rooms on our site. If a visitor signs up for a premium service, we collect credit card information along with a billing address. GameSpy may retain personally identifying information indefinitely. 

GameSpy automatically updates software used in conjunction with its services. In order to update these software titles, GameSpy will first collect the user's current version information from their hard drive. This information is not archived and is only used to determine which software titles require updating. 

At times GameSpy may maintain publicly available user profiles as well, which may contain personally identifying information volunteered by its visitors. 

**What does GameSpy do with the information it collects?**

GameSpy may use personally identifying information of its visitors to award prizes, track compliance with our Rules of Conduct, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when visitors provide the information). 

In addition, GameSpy may disclose personally identifying information about you, your accounts, or any content you provide on your site, if GameSpy believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, its visitors, or others. 

When you create a user profile or participate in interactive areas of GameSpy, including audio and gaming areas, all information volunteered by you is displayed or broadcast publicly to the GameSpy community and/or to the chat room that you are visiting. You should keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - in a user profile or in chat areas, for example - that information can be collected and used by others who visit that area of our site. 

GameSpy may record audio conversations or copy text chat or video images from chat rooms on our site and may disclose such material for use in promoting GameSpy or its services or if GameSpy believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement or copyright policy, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, its visitors, or others. 

Other companies which provide services on our site, or which advertise on our site, may collect information about you. GameSpy does not control collection or use of this information. You should contact these companies or advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. We will provide notice to you if one of our partners or sponsors collects information about you on our site, such as through a tournament, sweepstake, or contest. 

With the permission of a visitor who is 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of registration or submission - including but not limited to age, phone number, address, and income level - may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by GameSpy and may be shared with companies that have been pre-screened by GameSpy. If a visitor objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request sent to privacy@gamespy.com or if available by modifying his/her registration information online. See "How to Unsubscribe" below. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending an e-mail to us at the above e-mail address and providing us with your exact name and address. We also will notify other organizations with which we share such information and request that they remove your information from their mailing lists. See "How to Unsubscribe" below. 

**How will GameSpy protect your personal information?**

GameSpy will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us. Whenever you give GameSpy sensitive information (credit card numbers, for instance), GameSpy will take commercially reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. 

**How to update personal information**

You can help GameSpy to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any change to your address, title, phone number, or e-mail address. If at any time you wish to modify your information or stop receiving communications from GameSpy, you can contact GameSpy through e-mail at privacy@gamespy.com or at Privacy, GameSpy, 18002 Skypark Circle, Irvine, CA 92614. Please include your e-mail address in the message. 

**Policies for individuals under 13**

GameSpy encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children (persons under the age of 13 years old) and to participate in the interactive activities offered on our service. No information should be submitted to or posted at GameSpy's Web sites by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

We will not knowingly use information collected from visitors under 13 years of age for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside GameSpy. Visitors' e-mail addresses are not posted on GameSpy, unless provided by a visitor as part of a user profile. 

**About IP addresses**

GameSpy collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

When visitors request pages from GameSpy, our servers log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 

**Use of cookies**

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from GameSpy, you won't be offered as many afterwards. 

**How GameSpy uses cookies**

Each browser accessing GameSpy is given a unique cookie, which is then used to determine the number of unique site visitors. An additional cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, the online commerce (when offered by GameSpy), may be operated by a separate company, not GameSpy, uses a temporary cookie to track which products you purchase while shopping. A cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. 

**How GameSpy does not use cookies**

GameSpy does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, GameSpy does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. GameSpy does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. GameSpy does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the GameSpy cookies policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, like the shopping areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page. GameSpy Industries uses web beacons within the GameSpy Network in order to count users and to recognize registered users by accessing GameSpy Network cookies. 

By using this site, you signify your assent to the GameSpy Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of GameSpy following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. For a full explanation of the terms and conditions for using this site, please see our Software License Agreement and GameSpy Arcade Agreement. You can send e-mail to us with any further questions. 

**How to Unsubscribe**

From time to time, we make e-mail and postal addresses of those who access our site available to prescreened partners whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail or postal address with other companies or organizations, please [Edit your GameSpy ID account](http://www.gamespyid.com/) and uncheck the relevant options. 

If you request your e-mail or postal address not to be shared or choose to opt-out of any promotion, GameSpy Industries will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, GameSpy Industries will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions.
