Privacy Statement

_As of August 15, 2007_

In the course of operating our business, Filogix Limited Partnership and its general partner Filogix Inc. (together, “Filogix”) may collect personally identifiable information from our customers, from our employees and from others. Filogix values its relationship with these individuals and recognizes the importance of an individual's right to keep personally identifiable information private. 

We recognize the importance of an individual's right to keep personally identifiable information private. Filogix is committed to ensuring that the personal information in our custody remains secure and is not used in a manner without such individual's consent. We are committed to adhering to the principles set out below, which are based on the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_. For a more complete description of Filogix' information practices, please refer to the Filogix Information Practices Code, which is available by [clicking here. ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125322id_/http%3A//www.filogix.com/showPage.do?page=fipc)

**Accountability**

Filogix is accountable for all personal information in its control. This includes information under the direct control of Filogix as well as personal information we have transferred to third parties for data storage. 

Even though numerous individuals within Filogix are responsible for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information, our Privacy Officer is ultimately accountable for the handling of personal information under the control of Filogix and for ensuring that the principles set out in this privacy statement are being complied with. 

Any questions about the manner in which Filogix handles personal information should be directed to our Privacy Officer, who can be reached by e-mail at [privacy@filogix.com ](mailto:privacy@filogix.com), by fax at 416.360.8224 or by mail at 276 King Street West, Suite 400 , Toronto , Ontario , M5V 1J2. 

**Obtaining Consent to Our Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

A majority of the personal information that we collect is received from third parties such as credit bureaus and mortgage brokers. We rely on these organizations to obtain consent directly from the individuals and we do not use or disclose the information that these third parties provide us except as required in providing our services. 

Whenever Filogix collects personal information, we always disclose the purposes for which we are collecting the information, the manner in which we plan to use the information and the entities to whom the information will be disclosed. We also obtain individuals' consent for our collection for these purposes. If we choose to use personal information already in our custody for a purpose which was not identified at the time we initially collected the information, unless the new purpose is required by law, we will seek the consent of the affected individuals before using this information for these purposes. 

We do not collect personal information that is not necessary for the purposes we identify when we collect it. We will not refuse to provide a service to an individual if they choose not to provide us with their personal information, unless their failure to provide such information makes us unable to provide such service. 

**Filogix' Handling of Personal Information**

Filogix does not store information it collects indefinitely. Personal information used to make decisions directly affecting an individual are subject to a minimum retention period of one year from the date the decision is made. We have instituted policies and procedures to ensure that we retain all information in our custody only as long as necessary to fulfill our identified purposes. Personal information that is no longer required for statutory or regulatory requirements or to fulfill the purposes we identified when we collected the information is destroyed, erased or rendered anonymous to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information. 

We have created information security policies and procedures and have implemented security safeguards to protect personal information in our control against loss and theft. Our security policies and procedures include organizational, technical and physical measures. These safeguards are intended to protect information from unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. All personal information in Filogix' control is protected, regardless of the format in which it is stored. 

**Openness and Accountability**

We are committed to open and fair privacy practices which comply with the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ as well as any other applicable legislation. 

Any individual may inquire about the personal information that Filogix has in its custody by contacting our Privacy Officer. After receiving such a request, our Privacy Officer shall inform the individual of the existence, use and disclosure of their personal information and shall allow the individual to access such information. If the Privacy Officer cannot give the individual a list of the actual disclosures, he or she will provide the individual with a list of organizations to which Filogix may have disclosed their personal information. 

Typically, personal information provided to Filogix will not be routinely updated. Where personal information that is used on an ongoing basis is not accurate, complete, and up-to-date, upon being advised of such inaccuracy, the Privacy Officer will takes steps to ensure that this information is corrected. If such information was received from a third party, the Privacy Officer will assist the individual in correcting their personal information with that third party. 

In the event that an individual wishes to challenge our compliance with any of these principles, they can contact our [Privacy Officer ](mailto:privacy@filogix.com) using the contact information set out above. We will investigate all written complaints, and if we find a complaint to be justified, we will take all appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending our policies and practices.
