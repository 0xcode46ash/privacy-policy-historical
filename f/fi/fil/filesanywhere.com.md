In summary

**What information is collected?  How is it used?**

  * It is your choice to furnish personal information such as your mailing address or gender.  Volunteering this information is extremely helpful to us in attracting sponsors suited to our audience. This in turn helps us offset the expenses of running the site. However, it is optional for you to provide this info.

  * Upgrades are available now and other enhanced services are being developed for future releases of FilesAnywhere. If you choose to upgrade your service to a paid account, we will need your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date to process and fulfill your order.

  * When you request information or sign up for any optional services, we only need an e-mail address or FilesAnywhere username to send back the requested information.

  * In an upcoming release of FilesAnywhere, a User Directory lookup feature will be added that will let you search for users. At the time this is announced, you will be given the opportunity to participate in the directory, or decline to have your name hidden. The only information being planned for display in the searchable directory are First Name, Last Name, and City.

  * When you submit feedback, we may also ask for your e-mail address, if you are not a registered user or cannot login.

  * When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

  * We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of FilesAnywhere.

  * We may also use the information we collect to **** occasionally **** notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new FilesAnywhere services, related news, and special invitations we think you'll find useful.  If you would rather not receive this information, open your Profile from the Main View to change your preferences.

  * When you send files and messages through the FilesAnywhere E-Send or Email services, we ask for your e-mail address and that of the recipient in order to complete your request. FilesAnywhere will never disclose or send promotional e-mail to recipient addresses provided only for the FilesAnywhere E-Send or Email services without your permission.  





**How does FilesAnywhereprotect user information?**

> The FilesAnywhere.com web site has state of the art security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

  * Presently, all of the customer data we collect is strongly protected against unauthorized access at the FilesAnywhere data center. This applies to your files as well as your personal profile. All FilesAnywhere files are stored on a file system, granted by the National Computer Security Center (NCSC) with Class C2 certification. Organizations such as the IRS, branches of the military, the Federal Reserve, most United States intelligence agencies, and a number of commercial organizations all require the use of Class C2 certified products. The Internet as a medium of information is not included in this classification, but the FilesAnywhere server farm and backend do fall under this class of security architecture.  
 

  * Our world-class FilesAnywhere.com data center is located in the heart of Dallas, Texas at the modern INFOMART building, built literally from the ground up to be optimized for Internet service providers.

  * FilesAnywhere is strictly a password-protected account. As long as you do not give your password to anyone, you have full control of the files in your account. We are absolutely committed to keeping the content of your files private and secure. Only a few dedicated network technicians on duty at the data center have access to the secure FilesAnywhere file storage system. Technicians are not permitted to open customer documents unless required by law, and are bound with agreements of confidentiality.  
 

  * With future paid services, when you place orders for upgraded service or access your billing information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us, so one can intercept it on the Internet.
