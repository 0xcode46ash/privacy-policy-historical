## FilesAnywhere Makes Your Privacy a Top Priority

In today's online environment, we understand how important it is to protect our customer's privacy. You can rest assured that FilesAnywhere is committed to safeguarding your data and personal information. 

### Information Protection

**Personal Information** : FilesAnywhere uses state-of-the-art security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of any personal information that is within our control. All of the customer data we collect is strongly protected against unauthorized access at our data center. Our world-class facility located in the heart of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex was built from the ground up and optimized for Internet service providers. Our data center building provides ironclad security and solid reliability using the same standards as hospitals, banks, and telecommunications industries.

**Files and Data** : FilesAnywhere stores all data on a highly secure system, and you may also opt to use secure server software (SSL) login for fully encrypted communications with our server. The SSL encrypts all information before it is sent to us, so no on can intercept your important documents on the Internet. Additionally, your account is strictly password protected. As long as your password is kept secret, you have full control of the files in your account. 

**FilesAnywhere Employees** : FilesAnywhere is devoted to keeping the content of your files private and secure. Only a few dedicated network technicians on duty at the data center have access to the secure files storage system. Technicians are not permitted to access customer documents unless required by law, and are bound by confidentiality agreements for your protection.

### Collection and Use of Information

**FilesAnywhere Accounts** : It is your option to furnish personal information, such as your mailing address or gender, during the trial period. However, volunteering this information may be helpful to us in identifying you when you call our Help Center. In order to upgrade your service, we do require your name, email address, billing address, and credit card number and expiration date to complete your order. We always send your personal information to our servers using SSL protection.

**FilesAnywhere Services** : When sending files and messages through E-Send or email services, we ask for your email address, as well as that of the recipient, in order to complete your request. However, we will never send promotional email to, or disclose recipient email addresses, without your permission.

**Contests and Promotions** : Please be advised that if you request information, sign up for an optional service, submit feedback, or enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so that we may contact you. We may also use the collected information to notify you about important changes to our Website, functionality, services, or related news that you may find useful.

These statistics will never include no personally identifying information.

**Surveys** : At any time, FilesAnywhere may conduct customer satisfaction surveys for our own information only, and only for the benefit of our users. Surveys may be conducted by our employees or contracted to a third-party specialist.

A this time, we do not offer this service and have no plans to do so in the immediate future. Additionally, we avoid link-exchanges as much as possible in the interest of our customers' satisfaction.
