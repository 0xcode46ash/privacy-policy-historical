# Privacy Policy

We respect your privacy. We don't collect email addresses. We don't send out spam.

  


## Who Are We?

File.net, an open forum for sharing information about files, is one of the oldest sites on the Web dedicated to communicating detailed, carefully vetted information about the principal files used in software that runs on Microsoft Windows.

Ten years ago, we were among the first experts to analyze and classify Windows files according to their properties and behavior. Nowadays, our analysis tools are used all over the world by anti-virus software publishers, the military, government agencies, and law enforcement, and for special projects.

We have been members of the Association of Shareware Professionals since 1998. We also develop educational software for the blind and visually impaired, and take part in a variety of charitable activities.

  


## Information That We Collect

We may collect non-identifying personal information from you through our website.

_IP Address._ As is common practice for most Internet sites, our server automatically records users' IP information in our logs. These log files may include information such as your request, your IP address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. However, we do not use this information to individually identify visitors to www.file.net.

_Personal Information_.  This website does not collect, save or store any personal information from visitors to www.file.net. We do not collect personal information without your knowledge or consent. You are free to use a pseudonym when posting a comment.

_Cookies._ A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to "remember" a user's past activity on a website. Like many other companies, we or certain embedded third-party services like Google Analytics may use cookies to collect non-personal information.

_Embedded Advertisements._ We use reputable third party vendors like Google to provide advertising on our site. These vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits. You may visit www.aboutads.info to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising.

_User Communications._   If you contact us with inquiries or requests, we will retain copies of these communications in order to process and respond to them.

  


## What Information Do We Collect From Children?

At File.net it is our policy to collect only a minimal amount of information from children who visit our website. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

  


## Google Analytics

File.net uses Google Analytics to quantify and analyze the traffic that we receive. Although, as stated above, we anonymize your IP through Google Analytics, we understand that some users would prefer not to have their visits recorded. Furthermore, you can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize the Google Display Network ads by visiting the [Google Ads Settings page](http://www.google.com/settings/ads)

  


## Disclosure of Information

We may disclose your information:  (1) in response to a subpoena, court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency; (2) to defend ourselves against legal claims; (3) when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action in response to illegal activity, fraud or wrongdoing; (4) to protect the rights, property, and safety of our company, users, employees or others; (5) to enforce our website terms; (6) in the event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, merger, or consolidation; or (7) as otherwise required by law.

  


## Protection of Your Information

We take appropriate security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  Access to your personal information is restricted to our employees, contractors, and agents to the extent that they require it to maintain and improve our services.
