# FIDGET.COM: Your eNewsletter Headquarters

  
**PRIVACY POLICY**

Fidget takes your online privacy very seriously. As a free information site dedicated to helping you find only the information you want and need --- not information others decide you should have --- we've made protecting our visitors a high priority. 

**What We Do With Your Registration Information**

When you register as a member of Fidget, we ask you for your name, email address and other data like gender, zip code and birthday. This information is used to send you birthday greetings and let you know of news and contests that may be of interest to you. The more we know, the better we can serve you! 

Fidget may also occasionally drop you a note to let you know about new features on the Web site or Sweepstakes opportunities. Fidget does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. Fidget collects statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to share with reputable third-parties, but these statistics are presented as aggregate data and include no personally identifying information. 

**Your Consent**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Fidget. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we'll post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what kind of information we're tracking, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it 

**Send Us Your Comments** Fidget invites your questions and comments about our policies. Please send e-mail to [info@fidget.com](mailto:info@fidget.com)
