FICO may disclose Personal Information to third parties as required or permitted by law, under the following circumstances:

  * We may collect, use, process, and transfer, in electronic or other form, your Personal Information by and among, as applicable, FICO and its affiliates for the purpose of implementing, administering, and managing your business relationship with FICO, provide the product or service you requested, to contact you in connection with product or service offerings, or for other legitimate business purposes.
  * We may disclose certain Personal Information to companies, individuals, and other third party service providers with whom we contract to perform business functions and services on our behalf, as may be selected by FICO in the future. Such business functions may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing legal, accounting and marketing services, and providing other support services.

  * We may disclose Personal Information to the extent necessary or appropriate to government agencies, advisors, and other third parties in order to comply with applicable laws, or if such action is necessary to protect the rights or property of FICO or its affiliated companies.



The recipients of your Personal Information may be located in your country or elsewhere, and a recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of your personal data by contacting FICO, as described in this Policy. You may, at any time, view your personal data, request information about the storage and processing of it, require any necessary amendments to it, or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting FICO in writing, as described in this Policy. Your personal data  will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your business relationship with FICO.

We have up-to-date physical safeguards, such as secure areas in buildings; electronic safeguards, such as passwords and encryption; and procedural safeguards, such as customer authentication procedures to prevent ID theft. We restrict access to information about you to only those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We carefully select and monitor outside service providers, such as mail vendors, who have access to customer information, and we require them to keep it safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do. We train our employees on these security procedures, and we conduct regular audits to check on compliance with the procedures.

**The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US. Privacy Shield Framework**  
FICO (including its wholly owned subsidiary, Infoglide Software Corporation) participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. FICO has committed to subject to the Principles of the Privacy Shield all personal data received from the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield, including (1) notice; (2) choice; (3) accountability for onward transfer to third parties, for which FICO may be liable if we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage; (4) security; (5) data integrity and purpose limitation; (6) access; and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability.

  1. _Notice_. We will notify you about the purposes for which we collect and use information about you. We will provide information about how you can contact us with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information and the choices and means you have for limiting its use and disclosure.
  2. _Choice_. We will not disclose your Personal Information to a third party for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by you, without your consent. For sensitive information, we will get your explicit (opt in) consent if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us as described in this Policy.
  3. _Onward Transfer_. If we transfer Personal Information to a third party that is acting as an agent, we will (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Personal Information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles; (iv) require the agent to notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department of Commerce upon request.
  4. _Security_.  We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.
  5. _Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation_. We will collect and retain Personal Information that is relevant to the purposes of processing, and not in a way incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
  6. _Access_. You will have access to Personal Information about yourself that we hold, and you may correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. For security reasons, FICO will take steps to authenticate your identity before providing you with access to Personal Information.
  7. _Recourse, Enforcement and Liability_.  FICO will maintain a mechanism to provide that your complaints or disputes are investigated and resolved, and damages awarded where applicable law so provides. FICO will remedy problems arising out of its failure to comply with the Principles.  If you believe FICO has violated its obligations to you under the Principles, you should first raise the claimed violation directly with us, and we will respond within 45 days of receiving a complaint. If we are unable to resolve your complaint, you should next raise the issue through your Data Protection Authority to the U.S. Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue, at no cost to you. Then, if such violation still remains fully or partially unremedied, you may contact JAMS, which is an international dispute resolution provider, at no cost to you. JAMS may be reached by Internet at [@jamsadr.com](mailto:SafeHarbor@jamsadr.com), phone 800.352.5267, or mail to JAMS, 18881 Von Karman Ave. Suite 350, Irvine, CA 92612. If you are contacting JAMS to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about JAMS or the operation of JAMS’ dispute resolution process, contact Kathleen Pierz, JAMS Global Practice Development Manager, [kpierz@jamsadr.com](mailto:kpierz@jamsadr.com), 212.607.2771. The JAMS dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. For complaints and disputes over human resources data, FICO has agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities. You may, under certain conditions, invoke binding arbitration.



FICO is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission and other U.S. authorized statutory bodies. FICO will disclose Personal Information to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
