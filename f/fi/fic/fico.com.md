5\. European Union citizens: you may opt out of our (1) disclosure of Personal Information to a third party or (2) use for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.

We restrict access to information about you to only those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We carefully select and monitor outside service providers, such as mail vendors, who have access to customer information, and we require them to keep it safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do. We train our employees on these security procedures, and we conduct regular audits to check on compliance with the procedures.

FICO is committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles:  
• Notice. We will notify you about the purposes for which we collect and use information about you. We will provide information about how you can contact us with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information and the choices and means you have for limiting its use and disclosure.  
• Choice. We will give you the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether your personal information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.

• Access. You will have access to personal information about yourself that we hold, and you may correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.
