### Overview

Five Star Alliance takes your privacy very seriously, and we appreciate the fact that by using our service you are placing a great deal of trust in us. Our service has been built from the ground up with your privacy foremost in mind. We know that privacy is an important issue for our clients, and it is thus an important issue for us. We make it our highest priority to secure and protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information that you provide to us.

This policy clearly explains the type of personally identifiable information we gather when you use the Five Star Alliance service found on our web site: www.fivestaralliance.com. This policy also outlines the steps we have taken to safeguard the data we collect, and it explains the control we provide to you over the data we collect.

### Information we collect

The only personally identifiable information we collect is information that you voluntarily provide to us. This includes your email address and optional demographic information (such as zip code, gender and year of birth), collected when you sign up for our newsletter, and the information you provide to us when you book a hotel reservation. Booking information, required by hotels, includes name, address, contact information, and the credit card details used to hold a reservation.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use or delete your information to provide you services [contact us here](http://www.fivestaralliance.com/luxury-hotel-experts/contact-us). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputers, and enforce our agreements.

### How we use the information we collect

We use your information only for the explicit purposes for which you provide it. When you sign up for our newsletter, we use your email address for the purpose of delivering the specified newsletter to you. You will only receive the requested number of emails. We do not share your email address or your optional demographic data with any other party, unless you explicitly allow us to do so. We consider an explicit agreement to be a clear "opt-in" choice-a choice that requires you to take an action. We do not consider a box checked by default to be an explicit agreement.

When you book a hotel reservation with us, we deliver your information directly to the relevant hotel, and not to any other party. We store a copy of your booking information on our computers so that you can retrieve that information when you return to our site. However, for security purposes, we do not store your entire credit card number on our servers. Instead, we only store only the last four digits of the number.

When you use our "Email a Friend" feature, we use the names and email addresses provided by you for the sole purpose of sending an email from you to the recipient. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store any names or email addresses collected for this site feature.

### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety of the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

If Five Star Alliance is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.

### How we protect your information

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our reservation form, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Five Star Alliance uses the leading security technology available, including SSL, to protect and secure your information. We are certified by the industry-leading Verisign. To learn more about SSL, and for more information on our security certification, please click the Verisign logo.
