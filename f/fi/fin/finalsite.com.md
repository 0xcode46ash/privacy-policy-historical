Information Collection And Use

 **Emails and Web Forms  
** We collect information from users of our site and client portal such as name, email, school information, and phone number when you request demos or contact us. Personal information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information to you or respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, Finalsite staff or its contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level of interest in, or satisfaction with our services. We do not share or sell any personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.

In the event Finalsite goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

 **Orders  
** If you register for a Finalsite event, we request certain personal information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and school information) and, for chargeable events, financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes for event registration or to contact you if we have difficulty processing your order.

 **Testimonials  
** Our client contracts include client permission to post testimonials, both written and video, on our website. Permission to display client reference information (name, school, phone number) is obtained from our clients prior to displaying them on our site. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [education@finalsite.com](mailto:education@finalsite.com).

 **Blog  
** Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at education@finalsite.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

 **Surveys  
** Occasionally we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys is entirely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our Finalsite services and product offerings.

 **Share/Email-a-Page  
** If you choose to use the +Share link available at the bottom of most site pages, you will be invoking the AddThis tool which is a third party product enabling you to easily send our website links to other sites or to email a page link to a friend. All personal information (such as name and email address) you enter here is covered by the AddThis privacy policy, available at <http://www.addthis.com/privacy>.

 **Service Providers  
** We use other third parties such as a credit card processor to bill you for goods and services.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes.
