# Finish Line :: Customer Service

Privacy

  


Finish Line collects customer information so that we can offer our valued customers the products they want. We respect your privacy, and we assure you that we will maintain and use this information responsibly.

To improve our service, Finish Line logs the user's Protocol Internet Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your PC every time you browse the Internet. Information for IP addresses is used for system administration to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information, meaning the user session is tracked, but the user is anonymous. 

When you order products or register on the site, we ask you to provide your name, email address, mailing address, day phone number and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as create a password.

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, or to record past activity in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site. 

How does Finish Line use this information?

In addition to processing your orders for the purchase of merchandise, we may use the information provided to us for sending you special promotions or incentives, providing a service, gathering demographic and website usage information, improving our website and the quality of your online visits. Offers or other communications will come primarily from Finish Line. We may, however, share your information (not including your financial information) if you are a member of our Winner's Circle program and you have chosen to allow us to share your information with a select group of prescreened business partners or other companies so that they may offer you products or services that may be of interest. Aggregate information, such as the number or percentage of visitors who fall within certain category or categories, may be provided to a third party. You may opt out of this benefit at anytime. 

How do I opt out or change my preferences?

You can update your profile information at any time by logging in www.finishline.com with your email address and password. Once you have logged in, you can update your name, email, password, and/or change your address and preference to receive marketing information from Finish Line.

We recognize that you may not want to receive offers or other information from Finish Line or a third party. At any time you may request to discontinue receiving offers or other information from us or request that we not provide your information to third parties by replying to the e-mail or regular mail that you receive from us and informing us of your request. You can also call customer service at 1-888-777-3949 to opt out as well. Currently, Finish Line shares only Winner's Circle member's information that choose to receive marketing materials from selected third parties. 

Children's policy

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires Finish Line not to accept information submitted to this website by any visitor under 13 years of age. Visitors under the age of 13 years are still welcome to visit most areas of Finish Line's website. 

Cookies

  


Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow website operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences.

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and many major websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The 'cookie' itself does not tell us who you are, your email address or anything else personal. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on the site. We use cookies to help provide our visitors with a better experience on our site.
