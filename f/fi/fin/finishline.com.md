WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?

The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) personal information you supply, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through the Site or any of our store kiosks (where available).

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

  
We will collect personally identifiable information whenever you do the following: 

  1. _Purchase our products_.  When you purchase products from us through the Site or any of our store kiosks, we will collect personally identifiable information about you such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card number.  We use this information to process and communicate with you about your order.  When you purchase a product through the Site or one of our store kiosks, you may also choose whether you want us to send you information about our products, services, special promotions or incentives.
  2. _Create an account_.  You have the option to create an account with us on the Site.  When you create an account, we collect personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address and date of birth.  We use this information to manage your account and customize and enhance your online shopping experience.  For example, when you create an account on the Site, you will be able to create and maintain a Wish List of items that can be shared with your family and friends, use our “express checkout” feature, and view your entire order history.  You may also choose whether you want us to send you information about our products, services, special promotions or incentives.  You may choose not to create an account or not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the features on the Site.
  3. _Join our Winner’s Circle_.  You have the option to join our Winner’s Circle program, either on the Site or in our stores (including through our store kiosks), which provides you with rewards for shopping at Finish Line.  To join the Winner’s Circle, you will be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address.  We will also maintain a record of your purchases.  We will use this information to manage and communicate with you about your Winner’s Circle account.  When you sign up for the Winner’s Circle, you may also choose whether you want us to let you know about our products, services, special promotions or incentives.
  4. _Request a catalog and/or email announcements_.  You may request that we provide you with email announcements and/or our catalog by signing up on the Site or in our stores (including through our store kiosks).  In order to fulfill your request, we will collect your name, mailing address, and/or your email address.
  5. _Complete a survey or product review_.  On occasion, we may request that you complete a survey.  Your participation in any survey is completely voluntary.  If you complete a survey, we will use the information you provide to help us enhance our stores, the Site, and the products and services we offer.  You may also wish to provide us with a review of a product you have purchased.  If you provide us with a review, we will use the information to improve the products we offer and we may elect to post the review to assist other customers with their purchase decisions.
  6. _Enter a contest or sweepstakes_.  From time to time, you may have the opportunity to enter a contest or sweepstakes that we offer, either on the Site or in our stores.  In order to enter a contest or sweepstakes, you will be required to provide certain personally identifiable information such as your name, email address and/or mailing address.  We will use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes.  We may also use the information to let you know about our products, services, special promotions or incentives that may be of interest to you.  On occasion, we may join with a select third party to offer a contest or sweepstakes, in which case you may choose whether we may also share the information you provide on your entry form with our co-sponsor so that it can inform you of products or services that may be of interest.  Finish Line is not responsible for any co-sponsor’s use of such information.
  7. _Email To A Friend or Email your Wish List_.  If you elect to use any “Email To A Friend” or “Email Your Wish List” feature on the Site for informing a friend about the Site or products you are interested in, we will ask for the email address of your friend.  We use this information only for the purpose of forwarding the selected item(s) or your Wish List.  We do not store this information.



When you provide information for any of the above purposes, you may also be asked to provide demographic information, such as your age or state of residence. We use demographic information to analyze and improve the Site and the products and services we offer, as well as the quality of your on-line visits. We may also use demographic information and/or your purchase history to customize your shopping experience and to help us determine whether you may be interested in a particular product or service. On occasion, we may obtain information about you from other sources to enhance our ability to serve your needs, such as ensuring delivery of materials you have requested.

AGGREGATE INFORMATION

When you use the Site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the Site. None of this information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on the Site, or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information to make the Site more useful to our customers. 

  1. _Web Beacons_.  We use "Web Beacon" (also known as "clear GIF", "pixel tag", "data tag" or "image tag") technology to collect anonymous, non-personal information about how the Site is used.  We use this information to make improvements to our Site and to help us plan for technical improvements.  This information will not identify you or any other user of the Site as an individual.
  2. _E-Mail_.  We use clear gifs in our HTML - based emails that tell us whether or not you can accept HTML images and, if you can accept HTML, whether or not you viewed the e-mail.  We use this information to help us make e-mails about our products and services more useful and interesting. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer.  We do not sell this information to others, and we only use it to improve our e-mail communications with you.
  3. _Cookies_.  A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on your hard drive by a Web site you've visited. We use cookies to understand how www.finishline.com visitors click to the Site and what pages they view during their visit. Cookies allow us to personalize your shopping experience and speed the check out process. We do not store any personal or financial information in any cookie at any time.



We also use a session cookie, which is not placed on your hard drive. A session cookie is a piece of identification between your browser and our server that keeps track of the items in a your shopping cart and other session information. This cookie will disappear when the session expires or when you close your browser.

We may also use third party service providers to help us measure and analyze how visitors click to and use the Site. To do this, we may use cookies or web beacons provided by these third parties to track the types of non-personal information described above.

The “help” function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely.  However, if you don’t accept cookies, you won’t be able to take advantage of various features on the Site that are available to other visitors.

For our store kiosks, we use similar technology to collect the types of tracking information described above.  We use this information to help us understand how customers use our kiosks and to improve our customers’ shopping experience.  Please note that you will not be able to disable cookies used in connection with our store kiosks.

DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE?

Although the information we collect about you is important to us, we are not in the business of selling that information to others. We may share the information covered by this Privacy Statement with our affiliated companies (including Paiva and Man Alive) so that they may offer you products or services that may be of interest.  However, we do not share your personal information with unrelated third parties to use for marketing purposes without your consent.  If you do not want to receive promotional information from our affiliated companies, see the instructions below under “How Do I Opt Out Or Change My Information?”. In addition, if you became a member of our Winner’s Circle program between September 1, 2005 and May 26, 2006, we may share your information (not including financial information) with a select group of prescreened business partners or other companies so that they may offer you products or services of interest, but only if you have chosen to allow us to do so

In addition, aggregate information that does not identify particular individuals, such as the number or percentage of visitors who fall within a certain category or categories, may be provided to third parties.

We may also share your information with third parties in the following circumstances: 

  * **Service Providers:** We may employ third party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending email or mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments.
  * **Protection of Finish Line and Others:** We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or any rule, regulation, government or court order; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](http://www.finishline.com/store/corporate_info/terms.jsp) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Finish Line, our affiliated companies, our users, or others. However, this does not include selling, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Statement.
  * **Business Transfers:**   As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).  Also, in the unlikely event that Finish Line, any of its affiliated companies, or substantially all of its or their assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice and choice as to when your personal information might be shared with unrelated third parties.  For example, we may on occasion join with select third parties to offer promotions in which you may choose to receive promotional or other information from our co-sponsor.



HOW SECURE IS THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?

Finish Line believes in providing a safe and secure shopping experience for all of our customers. We want you to feel comfortable that personal information such as your name, address and credit card number will be kept safe throughout your entire shopping experience at [www.finishline.com](http://www.finishline.com/) and at our store kiosks.

The Site accepts orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology; for example, 3.0 versions or higher of Netscape Navigator and versions 3.02 or higher of Internet Explorer.  This means you'll be unable to inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection.  Our store kiosks also operate over a private, secure network. Despite all these precautions, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

HOW DO I OPT OUT OR CHANGE MY INFORMATION?

You can access and update information in your account profile at [www.finishline.com](http://www.finishline.com/) at any time by logging in with your email address and password. Once you have logged in, you can update your name, email, password, and/or change your address and preference to receive marketing information.

We recognize that you may not want to receive offers or other information from Finish Line or its affiliated companies.  At any time you may request to discontinue receiving offers or other promotional information from us, or request that we not provide your information to our affiliated companies for promotional purposes, by contacting customer service toll-free at 1-888-777-3949. Please be sure to let us know specifically which information you no longer wish to receive.  In the case of Finish Line email communications, you may also follow the instructions included in each email in order to discontinue receiving promotional emails from us.  Our affiliated companies’ emails, like ours, also provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of future emails from them.  If you have an account at [www.finishline.com](http://www.finishline.com/), you may also change your marketing preferences by updating your account profile, as described above. If you became a Winner’s Circle member between September 1, 2005 and May 26, 2006, you may request that we not provide your personal information to third parties for promotional purposes by contacting customer service toll-free at the number above.

Please note that, even if you request not to receive emails from Finish Line, you may still receive emails sent by a friend using “Email To A Friend” or “Email Your Wish List”.  In addition, we may still use your information to communicate with you for other purposes, such as your orders and purchases, for customer service, or regarding contests or sweepstakes you may have entered.

CHILDREN’S POLICY

We understand and share your concerns regarding your children’s access to the internet and the internet’s access to your children.  Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we do not knowingly request or accept information submitted to us online by any visitor under 13 years of age.

If we become aware that an individual under 13 has provided information to us online, we will not use or disclose that individual’s information for any purpose unless required to do so by law.

THIRD PARTY LINKS

INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS

Finish Line is based in the United States and does not currently sell its products directly to international consumers.  International consumers who wish to purchase our products on the Site may do so by clicking on the “International Checkout” link on our shopping cart page, which will transfer them to www.international-orders.com, a site owned and operated by Comerxia, Inc., our international shipping partner.  When you click on the “International Checkout” link, information about the products you have placed in your shopping cart will be transferred to www.international-orders.com, but any personal information you provide to www.international-orders.com in order to purchase our products from Comerxia is governed by Comerxia’s Privacy Statement.  Finish Line is not responsible for the privacy practices of [www.international-orders.com](http://www.international-orders.com/) or Comerxia.

OTHER THIRD PARTY LINKS

The Site may also contain links to other third party sites that are not under our control.  These sites have their own policies regarding privacy, and you should review these policies before providing information to these sites.  Finish Line has no responsibility for linked websites and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

TERMS OF USE, NOTICES, AND REVISIONS

If you choose to visit [www.finishline.com](http://www.finishline.com/), your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Statement and our [Terms of Use](http://www.finishline.com/store/corporate_info/terms.jsp), including limitations on liability and damages, application of the law of the State of Indiana and resolution of any disputes in Indiana.  If you have any concern about privacy at [www.finishline.com](http://www.finishline.com/), please [contact us](http://www.finishline.com/store/customer_service/contact_us.jsp) with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and this Privacy Statement, the [Terms of Use](http://www.finishline.com/store/corporate_info/terms.jsp) and the Site will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check the Site frequently to see recent changes.  Unless stated otherwise, any revised Privacy Statement will replace the prior Privacy Statement and will apply to past and current visitors. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our Privacy Statement to make it less protective of customer information collected in the past without notifying affected customers, either by communicating directly with those customers or by posting the changes on the Site.
