## Privacy Policy

Your right to privacy is of the utmost importance to us.

We understand that you are providing us with your personal information and that it is vital for us to earn your trust to provide our services to you effectively.

We believe it is our responsibility to protect your personal information. The services we provide are based on preserving your anonymity until you choose to disclose further personal details.

We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties.   
We release personal information only with your permission (including as outlined below in this Privacy Policy), or when we believe release is appropriate for legal compliance and law enforcement (such as to government agencies with statutory law enforcement responsibilities); to facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or to protect the rights or safety of our users or others.   
We have designed a thorough privacy policy with these things in mind. 

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, we encourage you to contact our privacy officer through our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contactform.aspx).

This privacy policy was last updated on 20th April 2011.

### Collection and use of your information

There are various kinds of information we collect about you:

  1. Private information that you provide us

You are required to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name and email address, to help us provide a safe service and, if required, verify your identity when you contact us. Your private information will never be sold to any other party and will never be disclosed by us on FindSomeone without your explicit permission. 

  2. Public information that you enter for your profile

You are encouraged to provide a lot of information about yourself for your profile to help find people to meet. You may update this information at any time. All information you provide for your profile should be considered public as any internet user can conceivably find this information. 

Members may also have the ability to see which other members have viewed their profiles. 

We provide [options](https://web.archive.org/editoptions.aspx) to allow you to restrict visibility of your profile and visibility of any photos you upload. If you select "show my photos to anyone" your photo (and profile) may also appear in the FindSomeone newsletter. If you wish to remove your profile from the FindSomeone website, you may do this using the "remove my profile" link on the [options page](https://web.archive.org/editoptions.aspx). 

Information collected is designed to minimise the ability for someone to identify you. It is your responsibility to control the extent of information you provide on your FindSomeone profile to help us to ensure your privacy is protected. 

  3. Financial information you provide us.

We offer services that require you to provide us with financial information such as your credit card number. We take all reasonable steps to ensure your financial information is securely transmitted and protected.   
We protect your credit card information during transmission by using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts your information when transmitted over the internet. FindSomeone retains only partial card details. Full card details may be held by the payment provider that processes the transaction. You may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contactform.aspx) for further information about this process. 

If you choose to make ongoing payments each month, your credit card details are encrypted and securely stored by the payment provider.

  4. Messages you send to other members.

FindSomeone provides facilities to allow you to send private messages to other members. These messages are private and only visible to the chosen recipient. FindSomeone reserves the right to read any of your messages where we receive complaints from the recipient of a message or have reason to believe that you are in breach of our terms and conditions or code of ethics. 

  5. Information provided to customer support.

Messages you send to our customer support team are private between you and our customer support staff and management.

Any communications from you or from others, relating to your membership or activity on FindSomeone may be stored in a file specific to you.

Customer service phone conversations may be recorded for internal training and quality assurance purposes. This helps us ensure the information we provide members is consistent and accurate. Phone records will be stored securely and will generally be retained for up to six months. 

  6. FindSomeone usage information.

We may collect information on how you use FindSomeone for the purposes of improving our services. This includes collecting and storing information relating to features you use and pages you visit on FindSomeone. See also the section on "Cookies" below. This information is mainly used for our own purposes. However, members may have the ability to see which other members have viewed their profiles. 

We use additional information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information will only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud or for law enforcement purposes. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised parties. 

If you choose to post messages on our Message Board, we will collect the information you provide.




### Email communication

We will not disclose your email address to other members of FindSomeone. In the event that you are sent a message from another member we may (depending on your settings) notify you that you have a message waiting. When sending a message to another member through FindSomeone, your registered email address will not be made available to the message recipient. 

We use your email address to allow us to operate our services. This includes sending you emails relating to our services, notifications of messages from other members and other related communication. 

We have a policy of enabling you to control the emails you receive and to opt-out of particular types of messages at any time. You can also change your notification settings through the [Options](https://web.archive.org/editoptions.aspx) page. 

### Control of your password

You are responsible for protecting your login details (your email address and password). Do not disclose this information to third parties. If you choose to share your login details with third-parties for other services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information. We strongly recommend using different passwords on different sites and that you review the privacy policy of any parties to whom you provide an email address and password. 

FindSomeone will never ask you for your address or password by email.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our website. We use cookies to improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are used on most major web sites. 

FindSomeone uses a combination of "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". "Session cookies" are removed from your computer shortly after you leave FindSomeone. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in and to prevent you having to do so more frequently. The technology we use requires the use of session cookies. 

FindSomeone also uses persistent cookies to personalise the member experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on FindSomeone and help us identify users abusing the FindSomeone services. 

FindSomeone participates in Google's AdWords pay-per-click advertising programme. AdWords advertisements appear on Google's search result pages and on the Google Network. Google uses cookies to measure the number of Google users that click on an advertisement and visit certain FindSomeone web pages, or who complete certain actions on FindSomeone (such as upgrading your membership). Google provides this data to FindSomeone without identifying the users. [View Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html). 

### Advertisers

We may at times promote 3rd-party advertisers on FindSomeone. Clicking advertisements may redirect you to sites where the privacy policy is beyond our control. We will never pass personally identifying information about you to advertisers - even when you are logged in and click on an advertisement. 

Different sites have very different privacy practices and policies. We recommend you locate and read the privacy policy of any site you are redirected to.

### Nielsen//NetRatings - NZ internet statistics

FindSomeone, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//NetRatings counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number of pages requested per day. To do this, FindSomeone has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see where we are in the 'top 10' list of New Zealand websites. 

For more information, view the [Nielsen//NetRatings privacy policy](http://www.nielsen-online.com/privacy.jsp?section=leg_scs).

### Updates to our information practices

From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of FindSomeone. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on privacy practices at FindSomeone. Your continued use of FindSomeone represents your acceptance of this Privacy Policy as amended.
