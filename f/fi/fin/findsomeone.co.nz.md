**Your right to privacy is of the utmost importance to us.**  
We understand that you are providing us with your personal information and that it is vital for us to earn your trust to provide our services to you effectively.

We believe it is our responsibility to protect your personal information and that you are the only person with the right to disclose any personally identifying information. The services we provide are based on preserving your anonymity until you choose to disclose further personal details.

We believe that you are the sole owner of information about you and that you should be in control of this information at all times.

We have designed a thorough privacy policy with these things in mind. 

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, we encourage you to contact our privacy officer through our [contact form.](https://web.archive.org/ContactForm.aspx)

This privacy policy was last updated on 20th February 2007.

**Collection and use of your information**

There are five types of information we collect about you:

**1** | **Private information that you provide us.**  
You are required to provide us certain personal information, such as your name and email address, so we can provide a safe service and, if required, verify your identity when you contact us. Your private information will never be disclosed or sold to any other party and will never be disclosed on the FindSomeone website without your explicit permission.  
---|---  
**2** | **Public information that you enter for your profile.**  
You are encouraged to provide a lot of information about yourself to help find people to meet. All information you provide for your profile should be considered public as any Internet user can conceivably find this information. If you select "show my photos to anyone" your profile or photo may also appear in the Personals section of Trade Me and the FindSomeone newsletter in addition to the FindSomeone site. Information collected is designed to minimise the ability for someone to identify you. It is your responsibility to control the extent of information you provide on your FindSomeone profile to help us to ensure your privacy is protected.

We provide options to allow you to restrict visibility of your profile and visibility of any photos you upload.  
  
**3** | **Financial information you provide us.**  
We offer services that require you to provide us with financial information such as your credit card number. We take all reasonable steps to ensure your financial information is securely transmitted and protected.  
**4** | **Messages you send to other members.**  
FindSomeone provides facilities to allow you to send private messages to other members. These messages are private and only visible to the chosen recipient. FindSomeone reserves the right to read any of your messages where we receive complaints from the recipient of a message or have reason to believe that you are in breach of our terms and conditions or code of ethics. In all other cases, these messages remain totally private.  
**5** | **Messages you send to customer support.**  
Messages you send to our customer support team are private between you and our customer support staff and management.  
**6** | **Site usage information.**  
We may collect information on how you use our website for the purposes of improving our services. This includes collecting and storing information relating to what features you use and what pages you visit on our website. This information is used for our own purposes only. See the section on "Cookies" below.

We will never sell, trade or otherwise disclose your personal information, email address, or any other information you provide us. We may, in extreme cases, be legally required to disclose information (such as by court order), in which case we will do so.  
  
**Email communication**  
Your email address is never made available to other members of the FindSomeone website. In the event that you are sent a message from another member we may (depending on your settings) notify you that you have a message waiting. When sending a message to another member, your registered email address will never be made available to the message recipient.

We use your email address to allow us operate our advertised services. This includes sending you emails relating to our services, notifications of messages from other members and other related messages.

We have a policy of allowing you to control emails you receive and you can opt-out of any messages at any time. You can also change any of your notification settings with the "My Options" section of FindSomeone .

**Control of your password**  
You are responsible for protecting your username, email address and password. Do not disclose this information to third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address or password with third-parties for other services, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information. We strongly recommend using different passwords on different sites and that you review the privacy policy of any parties to whom you provide an email address and password.

FindSomeone will never ask you for your username, email address or password by email.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our website. We use cookies to improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are used on most major web sites. 

FindSomeone mostly uses "session cookies", which are removed from your computer once you leave FindSomeone. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in and to prevent you having to do so more frequently. The technology we use (Microsoft Active Server Pages), requires the use of session cookies. Session cookies expire and are deleted after 20 minutes of no activity on FindSomeone. 

FindSomeone also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as how often members visit). Persistent cookies allow us to track users on FindSomeone and helps us identify users abusing the FindSomeone services.

**Advertisers**  
We may at times promote 3rd-party advertisers on FindSomeone. Clicking advertisements may redirect you to websites where the privacy policy is beyond our control. We will never pass personally identifying information about you to advertisers - even when you are logged in and click an advertisement.

Different sites have very different privacy practices and policies. We recommend you locate and read the privacy policy of any site you are redirected to.

**Nielsen//NetRatings (formerly Red Sheriff)**  
FindSomeone, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//NetRatings (formerly Red Sheriff) counting system to collect information such as visitor numbers per day or pages requested per day. To do this, FindSomeone has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics.This enables us to see where we are in the 'top 10' list of New Zealand websites. 

For more information, please review the Nielsen//NetRatings privacy policy.
