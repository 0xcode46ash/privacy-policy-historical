# Fine Stationery.com // Personalized Stationery, Wedding Invitations, Birth Announcements, Party Invitations, Moving Announcements, Cards &amp more

**Our Promise to You**   
We believe that stationery, invitations and announcements represent the most personal and private means of communication. FineStationery.com is committed to protecting that privacy and building a foundation of trust with our clientele by adhering to the strictest Internet privacy standards and deploying the most sophisticated security measures available. At FineStationery.com, we are dedicated to respecting your privacy and ensuring your security on our site. The following privacy and security policy is to inform you about how and why we collect any information about you, and what we use this information for on our web site. 

**Information We Collect and How We Use it  
** FineStationery.com collects from our users only the information that is necessary to complete an order - billing information and credit card. FineStationery.com is the solitary holder of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.

**Registration  
** Registration is not required in order to use our site. Users have the option required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is then used to contact the user about the products and services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**'My Account' functionality  
**Registration allows customers to utilize 'saved design' functionality on the website. Users can customize an unlimited number of stationery items. The text on these saved designs may contain personal information including addresses, contact information, or dates of personal events. This information is only available to the registered user. The customer also has the ability to 'share their saved designs'. This is available so that a customer can allow other people to view or comment on their saved stationery designs. FineStationery will provide a link to the invitee to view the saved stationery. Saved designs are not available to any other parties. 

**Your Order**   
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name, phone number and shipping address) and billing information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. If you submit a different address for shipping than for billing, that personal information is only used for the purpose of shipping the package. The shipping recipient will not be added to any marketing distribution list or future correspondence. **

Orders Sent as Gifts

** If you submit a different address for shipping than for billing, that personal information is only used for the purpose of shipping the package. The shipping recipient will not be 'opted-in' to any marketing distribution lists or future correspondence. You will have the ability to specify an email address for the recipient if you wish for FineStationery to send them an email notification 'gift message'. This gift notification is the only correspondence FineStationery will have with the recipient. 

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

FineStationery.com also employs a third party clickstream tracking company. This provider is used to aggregate visitor's site navigation and identify exit pages where customers leave the site. No personal identifying information is recorded by this tool, and only FineStationery.com has access to the summarized data. FineStationery does not share any of this information with other partners or vendors. 

**Log Files  
** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Newsletter  
** If a user wishes to subscribe to any future newsletter, we ask only for contact information such as name and email address. You may subscribe to the newsletter simply by sending an email to [info@finestationery.com](mailto:info@finestationery.com). You may unsubscribe by sending an email to the same address. 

**Security**   
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to:[customerservice@finestationery.com](mailto:customerservice@finestationery.com)

**Special Offers**   
We send all new registered members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice policy below. 

**Service Providers**   
We co-brand a portion of our site with SurveyMonkey.com. Our Catalog Request page is framed to look like the FineStationary.com website, but SurveyMonkey.com is actually collecting the users shipping address, name, and email when a catalog request is submitted. SurveyMonkey.com only uses the information collected to consolidate our mailing list. Users will not receive any correspondence from SurveyMonkey.com. FineStationery.com uses the SurveyMonkey.com collected information to send out catalog requests.

We have an in-house fulfillment department to ship orders, and in-house, secure electronic transaction processing software to charge users for goods and services. These entities do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes, and are prohibited from using the data for any other purposes. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:  
** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at [customerservice@finestationery.com](mailto:customerservice@finestationery.com)

**Choice  
** Registered users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from us may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [customerservice@FineStationery.com](mailto:customerservice@FineStationery.com). Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**Notification of Changes**   
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will only use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email at least 30 days prior to such change. In addition, the change to the privacy policy will be posted at the top of this page on the web site. 

**Legal Disclaimer  
** Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.
