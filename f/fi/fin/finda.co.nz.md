### Links to other websites

Our websites provide links to other websites. Please note that these websites may have different security and privacy policies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for any information that you divulge to these websites or how those websites or the organisations that own and manage those websites collect, use or disclose such information.

### Use of cookies

Information about the use of our websites is of commercial value to us. To help us provide the best possible results on our websites, advertising services for users and advertisers, and other services for our customers, we may collect and store information about the way our websites are used (such as how many computers connect to each website, which pages are viewed, and which browsers are being used) and the products and services advertised on the websites. This may include sending a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a message given to an internet browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This identifies your computer uniquely but does not harm your computer and does not identify you.

Our websites use one type of cookie for reporting on the use of the website, and another type of cookie to provide you with certain website functionality (such as displaying content more relevant to you, or enabling you to retain search queries). Cookies will be sent to your computer the first time you visit one of our websites. If you do not wish to have a cookie placed on your computer, please visit <http://info.yellow.co.nz/optout.html>. Alternatively you may be able to disable all cookies via your browser’s “Options” or “Preferences” menu.

This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to this website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this website, our third-party advertiser may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, please visit <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.

### Nielsen//NetRatings – NZ internet statistics

We may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our websites. This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to our websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

### Security

Although we use safeguards to protect your personal information against theft, loss or unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure or disposal, as no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, we cannot ensure and do not warrant the security of information you transmit or receive through our websites. These activities are conducted at your own risk.
