### Use of cookies

To assist us in providing the best possible results on our websites, we may gather information about how people use the websites using online “cookies”. A cookie is a message given to an internet browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. It identifies your computer as a unique computer but in no way identifies you nor harms your computer.

finda websites use one type of cookie for reporting on the use of the website, and another type of cookie to provide you with key website functionality, such as retaining search queries. Cookies will be sent to your computer the first time you visit a finda website. You can choose to disable all cookies by managing your browser preferences. For most browsers this can be done via “Options” or “Preferences” under one of your browser menus.

The information collected by cookies is on an entirely confidential basis, and includes details such as:

  * how many computers connect to the website;
  * which pages are viewed; and/or
  * which internet browsers people use when visiting.
