In a few sections of our Website, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit or to follow up with you after your visit. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. Our advertisers may also send you cookies. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:  
(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law  
(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings  
(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk)

We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
