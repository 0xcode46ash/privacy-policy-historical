Generally, ABBYY uses the information we collect to enable the operation of the Portal and to improve the Portal, to better meet our customer needs, to comply with applicable laws, and to protect the rights of ABBYY, its users, and the public. For instance, we may use the information we collect

Information that is collected may also be disclosed to ABBYY’s partners, and/or third parties. Disclosure may be solely to improve the quality of resources and providing access rights to the resources available on the Portal, and not for spam. Additionally, the pages of the Portal may include social media plug-ins. Usage of these plug-ins may allow social media services to use information about your browsing behavior.

**2\. Our Mutual Responsibilities With Regard To Your Information.**

ABBYY can send you e-mails for marketing purposes. You can revoke your consent to receive such e-mails by sending a revocation to the contact e-mail address or by changing the corresponding setting in your Profile on the Portal. In the event you revoke your consent by using any of the above methods, the consent shall be deemed revoked within thirty (30) working days from the day of receipt of the revocation by ABBYY.

It is our goal to use and handle information collected in a responsible manner. For one, we strive to limit our use of information that we collect as set forth herein. We also take measures to secure your information by physical, legal, and technological means, such as storing your information on secure servers, located on premises that permit access only to authorized ABBYY personnel, encryption of data transfers (such as information contained on registration and profile pages) and provision of the technical ability to protect your account with a password. In spite of such precautions, the security of your information cannot be absolutely guaranteed. First, we believe that no security system is impenetrable or fail-proof.

Further, ABBYY cannot control what information you choose to upload, or your handling or treatment of your information. Therefore, you must exercise sound judgment with regard to what information you choose to upload, including without limitation to forming your own assessments as to the propriety, risks, and sensitivities with regard to the information you transmit. You are also encouraged to take steps to secure your information, such as not divulging your password to others.

By your use of the Portal and resources, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, you agree that ABBYY will have no liability to you or any other party in connection with the information that you provide or that is collected by ABBYY, or any damages that may result from the handling or treatment of such information, or the disclosure or misuse of your information by third parties. You voluntarily and fully assume the risks for all consequences that relate to any and all information that you choose to upload or transfer.

**3\. Location of the Servers of the Portal.**

Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which ABBYY and its group and partner companies maintain facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing, ABBYY reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using the resources, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country for the purpose of enabling you to use the resources. As ABBYY continues to develop its business, ABBYY might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, as well as in the event that ABBYY or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of the users of the Portal will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party. ABBYY, alone, has the right and sole discretion to determine the location of the servers of the Portal and resources.

**4\. Other Websites.**

The ABBYY website may contain links to other websites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those websites.
