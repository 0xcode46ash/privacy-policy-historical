## Use of your information by other companies

We share user information with other companies for various reasons. What information we make available to other companies depends on the nature of our relationships with them. We generally require these other companies to keep our users' information confidential.

Service Providers: We may share all of the types of information we collect with vendors who provide services (such as email messaging), conduct surveys, and run sweepstakes on our behalf.

Advertisers and behavioral targeting companies: Advertisers, advertising networks and behavioral targeting companies use tracking technologies to collect information about users' computers and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users. We sometimes allow these companies to collect such information when you use our sites to enable them to display targeted ads to you.

## Tracking technologies

We, as well as other companies, use tracking technologies to collect and store data about your computer or mobile device and your activities on our sites.

Cookies: When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites. Our cookies expire after two years, and we reset this timeline after a year. Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads. Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.

Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies. To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button. To learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: [deleting cookies](http://answers.ask.com/Computers/Networking_and_Security/how_to_delete_cookies_from_computer) and [deleting flash cookies](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/).

Pixel tags and other technologies: We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These technologies are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). For example, we use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).

## Children's privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are not 13 or older, you may not create an account with us.

## Information from users outside the United States

If you're outside the United States, your information will be sent to and stored in the United States, where our servers are located. By using our sites, you agree to the information collection, use, and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.
