# Near Me Privacy Policy

Last updated April 5, 2015

## Your privacy is critically important to us. At Near Me we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We won't ask you for personal information unless we really need it.
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.
  * In our service, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, kept private, and permanently deleted.



It is Near Me's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please send an email to [q1z4kl1@mosh-qgbr-lc.fjai](https://web.archive.org/web/20161025223436id_/http%3A//www.find-near-me.info/q1z4kl1@mosh-qgbr-lc.fjai).

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Near Me collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Near Me's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Near Me's visitors use Near Me. From time to time, Near Me may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Near Me also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Near Me does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Near Me choose to interact with Near Me in ways that require Near Me to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Near Me gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a website at Near Me to provide a birthday and email address. In each case, Near Me collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Near Me. Near Me does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Near Me may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to Near Me. For instance, Near Me may monitor the most popular pages on the Near Me site. Near Me may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Near Me does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Near Me discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Near Me's behalf or to provide services available at Near Me, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Near Me, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Near Me discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Near Me believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Near Me, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Near Me and have supplied your email address, Near Me may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Near Me and our products.

Near Me takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Near Me uses cookies to help Near Me identify and track visitors, their usage of Near Me, and their website access preferences. Near Me visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Near Me, with the drawback that certain features of Near Me may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Near Me, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Near Me goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Near Me may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Near Me may change Near Me's Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Near Me's sole discretion. Near Me encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
