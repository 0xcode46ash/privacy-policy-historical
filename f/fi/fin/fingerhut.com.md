**Information We Collect**  
In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, we collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, which allows us to track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individuals remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 

However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Site (for example, by making a purchase), we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs -- which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals. 

**Information You Volunteer**  
We collect the personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Site, for example, the information you provide when you request information about products or services, request a catalog, purchase a product or service, apply for credit, contact us regarding a purchase, or enter a contest or promotion. This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone number, credit card information, Social Security Number, birth date, gender occupation and personal interests and information used to verify your identity or for fraud prevention purposes. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our website. 

**Information Provided by Third Parties**  
When you apply for credit on this Site, we will collect personal information from credit bureaus. And when you use a credit card on this Site, we may use a third party to process your credit card. The third party will inform us whether your credit card has been accepted, so that we can complete your transaction. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We use "cookies," and similar technologies, such as Web Beacons (also referred to as "GIF files," "pixels," or "action tags"), to collect personal information and support the functionality of this Site. For more information about our use of cookies and Web Beacons, see below.

You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Site. For example, you will not be able to purchase products and services on this Site. 

We use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you. Some of these companies are given access to some, or all, of the information you provide to us and may use cookies on our behalf. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our Site.

We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about Fingerhut. 

From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy policies are consistent with ours. These are known as our Marketing Partners. In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personally identifiable information about you, to enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. We only share the information we believe is appropriate to enable the Marketing Partners to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts, and we require that the information be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained. We never share Social Security Numbers with our Marketing Partners. 

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our Marketing Partners. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. 

We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We call them our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. We also ask our Service Providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. 

Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to Fingerhut or to others. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it. 

**Email Privacy**  
Fingerhut will not sell, trade, share or rent the email address you provide to Fingerhut to anyone. We believe that your email address is personal and should be kept that way. We use your email address to provide you with better customer support, and to update you on Internet specials that you have requested.
