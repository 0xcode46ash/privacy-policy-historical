### About _Security and our Privacy Policy_

'Web security is stronger than in virtually any other area of commerce. If you are happy paying for a meal, ordering goods over the phone or paying by credit card in a shop, then you should feel comfortable passing your details over the web.'' Internet Investor Magazine.

**SSL Encryption & Secure Servers**

We process all purchase and member login transactions over our secure server using secure socket layer technology (SSL), to ensure that your account and order details are safe and secure. We also utilize additional encryption techniques in the shopping basket and account system to shield sensitive data from malicious hackers or prying eyes. In the database, passwords and credit cards are encrypted for storage using advanced crypto techniques and their details are kept in a separate section of the database from your account information. To give you some idea of the level of protection this provides, it would take 4,000 programmers over a year to exhaust all 72 quadrillion decoding keys in order to crack one small phrase passed from your computer to our secure servers.

**Thawte Certificate**

We are Thawte certified. This certificate acts as our digital ID card and proves we are who we say we are. To obtain this certificate we have had to prove our identity, location and authenticity.

**Lock & Key Symbol**

To prove our transaction pages are secure, look in the bottom corner of your browser window for the locked padlock or key symbol. (You must be using Netscape 2.0+ or any version of Explorer to see these symbols).

**Paypal or Google Checkout Alternative Payment Options**

You can place an order and keep your details private by paying with Paypal or Google Checkout - the 2 most well known internet payment options. Simply click on the Paypal or Google Checkout buttons in the basket.

### About _Delivery, Order Times, Delivery Costs & Shipping_

**UK Mainland Standard Delivery**

Starts from £1.95 within mainland UK. If the weight of your order exceeds 1kg the price rises to £3.95 and if your order exceeds 8kg the price will rise incrementally. Please add your products to the basket to get a total shipping price. Your order will be with you within 2 - 5 working days after the day you placed your order (providing you have ordered in stock items which are marked with a green tick). Eg. Place your order on Monday and it will be with you by the following Monday (we are sorry to say that sometimes during peak periods (ie Christmas, Valetines Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day) there can be a delay on the standard delivery. For this reason, at these times, we always recommend that you specify a next day delivery which is a trackable service.

Please note some of our personalised items require extra time to be made especially for you, before they can be dispatched. Please check the specific product page when ordering for these details.

**UK Mainland Next Day Delivery**

Starting from £5.95, we can send your order out for delivery the next working day between 8am and 8pm. The price rises incrementally if the total weight of your order exceeds 8kg. Please add your products to the basket to get a total next day shipping price. For this service (which includes next day timed delivery eg next day before 9am), your order must be placed by 16.00 GMT on a normal working day (Mon-Fri). If you would like to do this - please select the 'Next Working Day' shipping option when you check out. This service is subject to the items being in stock (in stock items are marked with a green tick). Eg. Place your order before 16.00 GMT on Tuesday and your order will arrive on Wednesday or, if you place your order on Tuesday after 16.00 GMT, your order will be with you by Thursday.

Our experience vouchers, chocolates, garden games and personalised goods have an earlier cut off time for Next day delivery or may not be available on a next day service. Please check the specific product page for this information when you place your order.

**Order Status**

The current status of your order can be found by logging into your account. If you have not received your order within 6 working days of placing an order (please ensure you ordered in stock items showing a green tick), please call your local Royal Mail Sorting Depot and ask if they have a parcel for you. If they do not please call us.

**What Happens if You're Out When Your Order is Delivered?**

You have every opportunity to send your order to whatever address you choose. We cannot arrange a specific time for delivery - this is out of our hands. Should delivery be attempted when you are out, the post office or courier company will leave a card. You can then call them to re-arrange delivery, or go to the depot to collect the parcel yourself. Both couriers and the post office return parcels to us if you have not collected them (or if the address you used is not correct) within about a week (please check with your local depot for accurate return times). If you have not collected the parcel in time and you ask us to send your order out again, there will be a £5 admin and postage charge to cover the costs involved and we will send out your order again once the original parcel has arrived back. Should you wish a replacement order to be sent out faster, you will need to pay in full for a new order plus the £5 charge and you will then be refunded for the old order when it is received back into our warehouse.

**UK Offshore Islands**

All offshore UK islands including Guernsey, Jersey, the Shetlands, Orkneys, Isle of Man and Northern Ireland are charged by weight for postage and packing. Please select 'UK offshore islands' (either standard or next day) as your shipping option and any postage cost will be automatically calculated for you. Postage charges are applied to these destinations depending on the weight of the order because we do not always use Royal Mail. Other couriers do charge substantially more to deliver to these destinations and we have to reflect this. Delivery charges start at £2.95.

**Anywhere Else in the World**

Shipping outside the UK is charged by weight. Please select from the appropriate European or Worldwide options (either in your basket or at the checkout) - the cost will automatically be calculated for you. This cost is an estimate and if your order is heavy or you live outside Europe we will need to get an exact quote from our international courier, which we will e-mail to you as soon as possible. Providing you have ordered in stock items (marked with a green tick) then:

**Europe**

Standard European delivery is up to 9 business days after the day you placed the order and Express European delivery is estimated 3-5 business days after you placed the order. Whether its 3, 4 or 5 days depends on the distance from the UK, eg Ireland is 3-4 business days and remote parts of finland will be 5 days. Please note that these are estimated delivery times and orders can sometimes be delayed by your local courier depot or they can be delayed in customs so refunds of international shipping charges cannot be given. Shipping costs provided in your basket and at the checkout are an estimate and if your order is heavy we will need to get an exact quote from our international courier, which we will e-mail as soon as possible. We cannot dispatch your order until you confirm that the new shipping cost is OK. Please add your home and work and mobile telephone number to help us contact you.

**Outside Europe**

Standard worldwide delivery is up to 15 business days after the day you placed the order (though it is often quicker than this) and Express worldwide delivery is estimated 3-7 business days after the day you placed the order. The exact number of days depends on the distance from the UK and the remoteness of your delivery address, eg the USA is 3-5 business days and the Cook Islands will be 7 business days. Please note that these are estimated delivery times and orders can sometimes be delayed by your local courier depot or they can be delayed in customs so refunds of international shipping charges cannot be given. Shipping costs provided in your basket and at the checkout are an estimate and if your order is heavy we will need to get an exact quote from our international courier, which we will e-mail as soon as possible. We cannot dispatch your order until you confirm that the new shipping cost is OK. Please add your home and work and mobile telephone number to help us contact you.

**Import Tax**

Delivery outside the EU may be subject to local import/customs taxes, which are your responsibility where they apply. The shipping company should advise you the charges due or else you should consult your local customs office. Unfortunately we cannot advise you what these charges will be prior to your order and Findmeagift is not responsible for them.  
If these local import/custom charges are refused or not paid by the customer, then the item could be returned to Findmeagift or possibly destroyed if too expensive to return. Please note: If this happens, we may not be able to refund your order. We would not be able to refund any original postage costs paid and can only refund for the returned product/s minus any costs incurred in returning them to Findmeagift.

**Order Status**

The current status of your order can be found by logging into your account. If you have not received your order within the time frames detailed above (please ensure you ordered in stock items showing a green tick), please call or e-mail us straight away.

**Indonesia and Russia**

We regret that due to the massive volume of credit card fraud originating from these countries, we cannot and will not accept orders from these countries and we do not deliver orders to these countries. We do apologise to legitimate customers for any inconvenience this may cause.

**Can You Send to a Different Delivery Address?**

Yes we can do this, simply add a new delivery address to your account (either through your account page or at the checkout)...you can have as many different delivery addresses as you need and they will stay on your account for future use. Gift wrapping, hand written tags & cards or printed messages are all available. You can choose these options at the checkout.

### About _Returning Stuff_

**"I'm sorry - I don't like it!"**

If you purchase something from us, it arrives and you just don't like it (or if the gift recipient didn't like it) - you can return it and we'll cheerfully refund your money providing the item is in its original condition. We will deduct loyalty points from your account accordingly. (Faulty items do not have to be returned in original condition - see below.)

You can cancel or return your order within 28 days without reason. We will refund your money, less any giftwrapping or shipping charges which you requested, within 30 days. You are required to return the goods and have a responsibility to take care of those goods whilst in your control. Unless the goods are faulty or were sent in error you will bear any costs in returning the goods. You will be responsible for any carriage or legal costs we incur in retrieving the item(s) should you not return them.

**PLEASE NOTE - we regret we cannot accept the return of personalised products, food items, fancy dress costumes and masks unless they are faulty or flying toys if they have been used. Also if the product uses electricity and you live outside the UK, it is the responsibility of the customer to check whether the product uses batteries or mains electricity and that it will work using the end users domestic electricity supply.**

**"Eek - it's broken!"**

If an item arrives damaged or faulty, or we have sent you the wrong item in error, we will of course replace it and refund you the cost of the return postage.

**PLEASE NOTE - we regret we cannot accept the return of flying toys if they have been used. Also items delivered outside the UK cannot be returned or refunded if they are faulty because their use outside the UK invalidates their warranty.**

**WEEE Regulations**

The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive is now UK law. The legislation aims to make producers pay for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical equipment. Much of the UK's WEEE ends up in landfill, where the lead and other toxins it contains can cause soil and water contamination. This can have a harmful effect on natural habitat, wildlife and also human health. Find Me A Gift are obliged under these regulations to offer our customers free take-back of their WEEE on a like-for-like basis when you buy from us a new Electrical or Electronic product. For example, if a customer bought a new EEE item from us we would accept their old WEEE item and prevent it going into a landfill site by disposing of it safely. Customers must return their WEEE item to us within 28 days of purchasing their new item. Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol. Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13th August 2005, and should be disposed of separately from normal household waste so that they can be recycled. Please quote your order number when returning your WEEE item. If you have any questions, please call us on 01926 818 800.

Any more questions, just email customerservice@findmeagift.com

### About _Loyalty Points & Discount_

**You get 1 point for every penny you spend**

Whenever you purchase from us, your account will automatically be credited with one loyalty point for every penny you spend (excluding sale items). Your points are automatically turned into a percentage discount.

You can save up your points until they reach a maximum of 20% discount, or you can use your points as you go along, giving you smaller discounts off your orders.

**Here's an example:**

If you spend £24.99, you will get 2499 loyalty points. This would equate to a 2.5% discount. You can use this on your next order (excluding sale items), or choose to save the points so they can build up to make more discount.

**Refunds & Returns**

If you return any items, the points awarded for the purchase will be deducted from your account. If you have benefitted from this discount prior to the return of an item, the discount awarded will be deducted from your refund when it is processed.

**Using points**

When you place an order, you can see the current number of loyalty points that you have (and discount value) at the checkout. You can choose to 'spend' or 'save' these points on that order. If you save them, they will not be used and saved for another day. If you choose to use them, the discount will be taken off that order. The value of your order will be recalculated to include the discount. Your loyalty points will then be zero and you can start collecting them again.

We are really sorry but loyalty points cannot be used against any items already on sale, on our activities or on Thornton's chocolate because they come from a large number of different suppliers who do not allow us to make discounts

**Free points**

Help us to help you by sending in your comments on our service, our website, writing product reviews and recommending friends. We reward you with free loyalty points for helping us to improve our service to you.

### About _Gift Wrapping_

**Single Parcels**

For every parcel you would like giftwrapping, there is a £3.95 charge, which can increase to £4.95 for large items, all charges are clearly shown in the basket and at the checkout. This charge includes the wrap and your message hand written on the tag. Choose the giftwrap style from the options available at the checkout.

**Multiple Items**

If you check more than one item for giftwrap (either in your basket or at the checkout), you will be asked at the checkout if you would like them all wrapped together or separately. If you ask for them to be wrapped together, then this will count as 1 wrap with 1 charge of £3.95 or £4.95 if one of the items is large. A maximum of 4 items can be wrapped together. If you need to give any special instructions please type this into the message field at the checkout. If you ask for them to be wrapped individually, you will be charged £3.95 or £4.95 per wrap/item. We are really sorry but some extra large items cannot be gift wrapped due to their size, if this is the case then N/A appears under the word Giftwrap? in the basket and at the checkout.

**Gift Tags**

Every wrap includes a gift tag. Just write your message into the message box at the checkout and we will then write that onto the gift tag when we giftwrap your item. If you do not write a message, the tag will be left blank and we will assume you will want to write the message yourself.

**Gift Cards**

Gift Cards are available on our 'Gift Cards & Vouchers' page.

**i)** You can purchase single cards with your order in case you've forgotten to pop to the shops.  
**ii)** Purchase a card to go with your gift - we can hand write your message and send the card with your gift.
