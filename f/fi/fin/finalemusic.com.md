# Your Privacy

Coda is committed to protecting your privacy. The information we gather from you enables us to process your orders and provide you with a more personalized shopping experience.

 **

What information does Coda collect and how is it used?

**

To process your orders and keep you informed of your order status, we need to obtain your name, email address, mailing address, billing address and credit card information.

To personalize your shopping experience, we draw on your purchase history, the pages you view on our site, and any voluntary profile information you submit to us. We also monitor overall customer patterns to help us improve the layout and design of our site.

We may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to our site, new products or upgrades and other special offers we feel you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information via email, please visit [ your Coda Profile page](http://www.codamusic.com/coda/shopper_update.asp?target=&pf%5Fid=&dept%5Fid=&attr%5Fvalue1=&attr%5Fvalue2=&attr%5Fvalue3=&attr%5Fvalue4=&attr%5Fvalue5=&use_form=1) and change your preferences at the bottom of the form.

 **

How is my credit card information protected?

**

Coda uses industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card information. All orders are placed using secure server (SSL) encryption, the Internet standard for secure transactions.

As an added precaution, any credit card information you submit with an online order is NOT stored with your user profile and must be re-entered with each new order. In other words, even if you tell someone your Coda login and password, they will not have access to your credit card information.

Finally, all of your Coda Profile and order information is stored on-site and protected from unauthorized access with the same technology we use to protect our private company data.

 **

What are "cookies"?

**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our site utilizes cookies to provide continuity to your shopping experience, particularly if you leave the site and return later. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Cookies are created by specific web sites and are completely inaccessible to anyone except the original author, further protecting your privacy. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies automatically, however, you can usually modify this preference if you so choose.

 **

Will Coda disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

**

Coda does not sell, trade or rent your name and address to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by visiting [ your Coda Profile page](http://www.codamusic.com/coda/shopper_update.asp?target=&pf%5Fid=&dept%5Fid=&attr%5Fvalue1=&attr%5Fvalue2=&attr%5Fvalue3=&attr%5Fvalue4=&attr%5Fvalue5=&use_form=1) and change your preferences at the bottom of the form. Coda may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, site traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

**

Your Consent

**

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Coda. We must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. We will post any changes to our privacy policy on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
