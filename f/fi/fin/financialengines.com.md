 **What personally identifiable information of mine is collected?**

Financial Engines collects information from you upon registration. At this point, you provide us with your name, zip code and e-mail address. Depending on your access to Financial Engines, you may be asked to provide us with additional information on the name of your company and a temporary identification number that identifies you as an employee of a company that participates in our corporate program. Upon successful completion of registration, you are taken to the service where you will enter information about your gender, annual income, state of residence, marital status and your individual financial accounts. If you indicate you have a spouse or partner, his/her personal and financial account information will also be requested. If you receive advice, we keep a log of the advice that we provide to you in our records for your protection. We are required by law to keep records of your usage of our advisory service. This enables us to provide you with a history of the advice we have given to you.  


If your access allows you to purchase a subscription, we ask for your credit card and billing information. Billing information is used to verify your credit card information. We use VeriSign to bill your credit card for the Advice portion of the service you requested. VeriSign is a well-known company that specializes in secure, online credit card processing.  


If you subscribe to our service, you also have the option to link an outside financial account to your Financial Engines account. This feature allows you to import your investment information from a financial service provider instead of having to manually enter this information. If you choose to use this feature, you will provide the account information, such as account number, username, password and other login information in order to link your account to Financial Engines.  


For some users, forms such as the Customer Support form and Forgot Password or User ID form, are available. These forms ask for some personal information, such as your name and birth date. This information is necessary and used only to provide the service you are requesting from those forms.  


Occasionally, we may also conduct optional surveys through our monthly e-mail newsletters. In this case, we would collect the information you provide us from answering the survey questions.  


Furthermore, we collect data in our log files. We collect your IP address, browser type and domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and subscribe to our service. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information that helps us to provide you with services and information that are relevant to you. We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others.  


If your retirement plan sponsor or administrator or other financial institution makes our service available to you, it may provide us with information about you and your account to reduce the amount of data you need to enter.
