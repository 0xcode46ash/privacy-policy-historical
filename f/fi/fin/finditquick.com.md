This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for WWW.FINDIT-QUICK.COM .

FINDIT-QUICK.COM is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way.   FINDIT-QUICK.COM collects information from our paying advertisers at several different points on our website.  
 

We request information from the paying advertiser on our payment form.  Here a paying advertiser must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes.  If we have trouble processing a payment, this contact information is used to get in touch with the advertiser.

Please be aware that FINDIT-QUICK.COM contains many links to other websites. FINDIT-QUICK.COM is not responsible for the privacy practices of such web sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies only to information collected for advertising on this Web site.

This website takes every precaution to protect our advertiser's information.  When an advertiser submits sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to **support@findit-quick.com **

We send all new paying advertisers a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established paying advertisers will occasionally receive information on special deals and updates. 

If a advertiser's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a advertiser no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that advertiser’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done in the Account Management Center **** or by emailing our Customer Support.

Be Aware  
Numerous other Search Sites make a substantial income selling your personal information to third parties. FINDIT-QUICK.COM will NEVER be part of this practice so ADVERTISE & SEARCH SECURE at FINDIT-QUICK.COM.
