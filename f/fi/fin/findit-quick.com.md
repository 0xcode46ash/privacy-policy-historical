We request information from the paying advertiser on our payment form.  Here a paying advertiser must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes.  If we have trouble processing a payment, this contact information is used to get in touch with the advertiser.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to **[support@findit-quick.com](mailto:support@findit-quick.com) **

We send all new paying advertisers a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established paying advertisers will occasionally receive information on special deals and updates. 

If a advertiser's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a advertiser no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that advertiser's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done in the Account Management Center or by emailing our Customer Support.
