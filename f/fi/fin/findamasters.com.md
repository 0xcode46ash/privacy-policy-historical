We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as outlined here. The following reflects our commitment to you. Information About General Visitors to our Sites

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as where users are referred from, what areas of the site they visit most frequently and which advertisements generate enquiries. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what areas are beneficial for our users, and how we can improve the website. We may share this information with our advertisers, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how our visitors, collectively, use our sites, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.

Registered Forum Users / Newsletter Subscribers

The Postgraduate Forum is accessible through all of our sites. Discussions posted on one site may be made available on some or all of the other sites. Information stored about registered Forum users helps us to monitor usage in the aggregate. For security reasons we may record and store the IP address of forum users.

Where a user of the Postgraduate Forum or a newsletter subscriber has agreed to receive information via email either from ourselves or from third party clients we will use personal details they have provided (e.g., full name, current status) in sending such emails. We may also monitor the frequency with which any user visits our sites and use this information to select users to contact for an internal or third party email campaign.

Cookies

We use cookies to record session information and to track a user's path through our websites. This information is only used in the aggregate to monitor site performance. We also use cookies to help registered users stay logged in to our forums.

The Search Facility

Banner advertisements on the search results page may be matched to suit the results of your search. Third party advertising may also be delivered through our sites based on the content of the pages you are visiting.

Information About Advertisers Logged in to our Sites

We record all logins to our sites by registered advertisers. This information is used in aggregate to monitor levels of usage and functionality. It is stored individually so that we remind advertisers of when they last logged in to the site and can trace any fraudulent access.

Feedback

Any feedback that is submitted through the 'Feedback' areas of any of our sites becomes the property of The Science Registry Ltd. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site. 

Privacy Commitment Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy commitment for our web sites, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy commitment, please feel free to email us at info@findamasters.com.

Thank you for using our web sites.
