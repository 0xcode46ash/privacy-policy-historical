# Privacy Policy | FINalternatives

**FINalternatives.com** is the Web site of **FINalternatives** , an information service of **Stone Street Media, LLC**. Stone Street Media is committed to protecting your privacy. The following statement describes Stone Street Media’s privacy policy as it relates to Stone Street Media's services, including ad placements, advertising, marketing and lead generation.

**User Information  
** Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual. Stone Street Media may collect non-personally identifiable information while you are visiting a Stone Street Media Web site or the Web site of one of Stone Street Media’s customers, including advertisers and Web publishers. With each advertising impression served, Stone Street Media collects information such as the time of day, URL visited, browser type, browser language, and IP address. Stone Street Media analyzes certain web pages of those publisher websites within our network. Stone Street Media may use page content, form data and URL parameters in order to improve its service to the users. In addition, the visited URL is sent to Stone Street Media's servers from the browser so that Stone Street Media may retrieve the applicable page content from the publisher's servers.

As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience, we may use any number of features, including Web beacons and cookies, to collect non-personally identifiable information. Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology or action tags, are small colorless image files placed on a Web page for the purpose of tracking the completion of transactions and the submittal of applications, which, in turn, enhances the online experience for our users.

Similarly, a Cookie is a file that the Internet browser places on your computer's hard drive. It is not a virus and cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer. A cookie controls the delivery rate of ads to Web browsers such that the number of times a Web browser receives any one advertisement is limited to ensure the best online experience for our users. A cookie also allows Stone Street Media reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign so that our advertisers can determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach.

Neither Web beacons nor cookies provide Stone Street Media with an email address or any other personally-identifiable information, and Stone Street Media does not and cannot use Web beacons or cookies to recover such information from the computers of our users. Again, Stone Street Media simply collects non-personally identifiable information for the limited purpose of optimizing the operation of Stone Street Media services, maintaining the quality and integrity of the services, and providing general statistics regarding our users. Although cookies enhance the online experience, Web users always have the option of blocking the use of the same by altering a setting in their browser. Please see your browser supplier's Web site for details on how this may be done if you object to the collection of non-personally identifiable information.

Stone Street Media may place advertisements of third-party advertisers on Web sites that you are visiting. If you choose to click on an advertisement, Stone Street Media may provide non-personally identifiable information to the advertiser and Web publisher. Also, the Web publisher or Stone Street Media’s other partners may use cookies, action tags, GIFs, or Web beacons to collect information when you are visiting their Web sites.  The information they collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not Stone Street Media’s.

**Submission of Personally Identifiable Information  
** When using services offered through Stone Street Media or its customers and affiliates, you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal information. You will have clear notification that we are collecting this information so that you can choose not to provide it.  Users may also provide contact information while visiting StoneStreetMedia.com or its related Web Sites to request information. 

**_Use of the Information We Collect_**

**Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**   
Stone Street Media may use non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of Stone Street Media services, for example, by increasing ad placements on Web sites that are receiving more Web traffic and presenting you with ads that we think you would be interested in viewing. Stone Street Media may market its services by sharing Web surfing data with business partners in such a way that you are not identified. Stone Street Media also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to companies so that they can perform services for us.

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
Stone Street Media does not provide personally identifiable information to third parties except under the following conditions.  If you provide personally identifiable information as part of an inquiry about products or services provided by one of our business partners, we will provide that information only to that business partner so that they may attempt to provide you with information regarding the products or services you inquired about.  
Stone Street Media may use the personally identifiable information provided by users or business partners at StoneStreetMedia.com or its related Web Sites for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing, and administration (e.g., billing, newsletters and communicating with our business partners and maintaining their account information).  We may share this information with third parties who provide Stone Street Media with administrative services.  If Stone Street Media shares any of the information collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be governed by the third party's privacy policy.

**Advertising Content  
** Stone Street Media's services display links to other sites in the form of "contextual advertising." Stone Street Media has no control over the content presented in such advertisements; third party advertisers provide them. The content of these advertisements is intended to show a high degree of relevance to the content you view. Stone Street Media parses the content of the URL visited, determines the relevant context and keywords and passes this information to the third party to obtain the advertisement to display. 

**Child Protection**  
Stone Street Media does not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 18.  In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we receive from people we believe to be minors will be purged from our database.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact Stone Street Media by sending an email though our [**CONTACT US**](https://web.archive.org/contact) page with "Privacy" in the subject line, or by writing to Privacy, Stone Street Media, PO Box 3195, New York, New York 10008.
