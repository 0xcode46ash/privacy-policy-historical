This website, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support of the responsible management of consumer information.

## Consumer Information

During the process of delivering our content and information to you, we do not automatically collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This non-personally identifiable information collected by us is used for the purpose of analyzing our traffic.

When you purchase a form from our site, we may collect certain personal information to identify you, and to assist you in purchasing your form. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your permission, except in the following circumstances: (i) to protect ourselves from liability; or (ii) to respond to a legal process or comply with the law.

## Credit Card and Payment Processors

Our Credit Card and Payment Processors may also collect information from you in order to be able to process your payments.

## Cookies

Our site, as well as most sites on the Internet, use cookies to enhance your experience on the web. Generally, we cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. The only time we can use cookies to personally identify you is when you choose to enable cookie identification. We use cookies to enhance your experience and enjoyment of our site. We also use cookies to allow transactions, such as form purchases, to take place as well as to allow users to login into accounts on the site. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience, they are not required to simply browse our site. 

Although we don't recommend doing so on our site, if you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information. 

## Platform for Privacy Preferences

FindLegalForms.com supports P3P, the Platform for Privacy Preferences, allowing us to convey our privacy policies, to the extent possible, in standardized, machine-readable code. While our site supports P3P, the resulting code has inherent limitations such that it may not completely and accurately express all of our data practices. Some P3P-enabled browsers may interpret the same P3P code in different ways, while others may interpret P3P code in a manner inconsistent with the original intention. Accordingly, your browser's interpretation of the P3P code should only be considered as a short-hand expression of our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy remains our primary policy, and takes precedence over the P3P code for all purposes.

**If you have any additional questions or concerns about our dedication to consumer privacy, please do not hesitate to[contact us](http://www.findlegalforms.com/xcart/customer/help.php?section=about).**
