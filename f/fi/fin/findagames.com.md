The Information You Provide

As you explore our website, you will come across places in which we ask you to provide us voluntarily with information about yourself. In most of these instances we are seeking only your e-mail address so that we can send you the specific information that you request, such as a newsletter or online subscription or purchase. In other instances, such as a contest, we request both your e-mail address and your name (along with your contest answer), so that we can contact you by name in the event that you win. If you choose to purchase an item through our direct sales service, we will need to collect additional information for billing and shipping, such as your full name, home address and credit card information. All of these activities–the subscriptions, contests and on-line purchases–are purely voluntary; if you do not wish to reveal your name, e-mail address or other information, you are free simply to ignore these offerings. If you decide to participate, we will not use your name or e-mail address for any purpose other than as stated, and will not sell or rent your name or address to third parties not affiliated with us. If you purchase an item from our website we may share your credit card information with an independent third party service whose function is to verify the information you provide, and we will store and make available information about recent purchases made through our website using your password. In addition, if you have been linked to our Shopping Cart service through the website of another publisher to complete your online purchase of that publisher’s books, we will share information about you and your purchase with that publisher.

At other places in this site, we ask for your feedback, opinion or suggestions, and provide you with a link for e-mailing us your response. We may also ask for your zip code or city of residence to gather geographical information about the visitors to our site. If you send your e-mail to us, it will include your e-mail address in the “From” line. But again, as in the case of subscriptions and contests, we promise to use the e-mail address we receive in this manner only for the purpose of responding to your questions or suggestions, and will not approach you with unsolicited offers or provide your e-mail address to anyone else.

One last area in which we ask for your name is on bulletin boards or forums–places on the site where you can participate in a discussion of a particular subject by posting written comments which are then entirely public. We ask for a name simply so that other people reading a string of comments will be able to determine which comments come from the same person. You may, therefore, provide a nickname or alias, if you prefer, so that your identity is not disclosed. You should be aware that if you do voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or forums, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. If you choose to participate anonymously, you should remember that you are still legally liable for the material you post, including claims of libel, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.

## What are browser games?

At findagames.com you will find quite a number of free browser games. Browser games are computer games which typically can be played without any installation on your computer and at any place or time.

All you need to play is a web browser and access to the internet. Once you have registered on the game page, you can log on with your username and password from any computer and continue with your game. There are many different types of browser games. Most games you can play without investing too much time a day. There are games, however, in which you need to play several hours a day if you want to be successful.

To make things easy, the games in our database are divided into nine main genres. Under 'Strategy', smart players and amateur strategists can find tricky games that require quick thinking. In 'Role Playing Games' (RPG), you can slip into the role of a hero, discover many exciting worlds and fight against monsters and other players. In the category 'Simulation' you find both social networks where you meet new people, and economic simulations which are very realistic. Our 'Sports' games include all sorts of sports games such as soccer manager games, golf simulations and many more. Action-packed combat awaits you in the genre ‘Shooter’. You slip into the role of a mercenary or soldier and try to lead your team to victory on the battlefield. The genre ‘Racing’ offers you the chance to grab the steering wheel of some of the most powerful vehicles in the world and prove your skills. 'Action' games, on the other hand are fast, action-packed games that are kind of intense.
