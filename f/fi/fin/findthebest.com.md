# Privacy Policy | FindTheBest.com

## **FindTheBest.com, Inc. Privacy Policy**

[FindTheBest](http://www.findthebest.com/) has created our Privacy Policy to explain to you how your information is collected, used, and protected. Our Privacy Policy may be updated by us from time to time. We will provide notice of material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting notice on the [FindTheBest](http://www.findthebest.com/) website (“Base Domain”). This Privacy Policy includes all subdomains associated with [FindTheBest.com](http://www.findthebest.com/) (for example, subdomain.FindTheBest.com), as well as pages that are related to the Base Domain.

**Collected Data**

We sometimes collect your email address for purposes such as notifying users when pages detailing entity data (“Listings”) have changed, confirmation emails, authenticating user accounts, accounting notices and other reasons including instances in which you have requested specific information or updates.

Some Listings ask for, require or include entity phone and fax number, email and website addresses and other potentially personally identifiable data. This data is optional and is intended to benefit the entity through promotion or display.

For credit card transactions we may pass required information to third-parties for the sole purpose of accomplishing the transaction.

Only in the event you expressly request such an action will we store credit card information locally on our servers. Credit card transactions, if any, are transmitted to a financial gateway; and we make every attempt to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

We may collect personal information if you provide it in feedback or comments, post it on or to our Listings or interactive forums, or if you contact us directly. Please do not post any personal information on Listings that you expect or wish to keep private. 

Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, including timestamps, your IP address, and page URL. Web logs help us to diagnose problems with our system and to provide better services to our customers.

**Privacy Protection**

Account information is password-protected. Please create a strong password and keep in a safe place. If you have forgotten your password we will only send the password registered to the account.  
Applications use standard webserver authentication. Please remember to logout. 

We do not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 13. If we learn that any data is added by a person under the age of 13, we will make every attempt to remove that data and the user will be banned from the system.

FindTheBest, or users who post on our sites, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy policies. We do not have any control over the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.

**Data We Store**

All Applications and Listings are stored in our database, even after "deletion," and may be archived elsewhere. Our web logs and other records may be stored indefinitely.

Registered users can access and update their account information via links accessible on the site homepage.

Although we make good faith efforts to store the information in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, it is simply impossible to - and we cannot - guarantee complete security.

**Archiving By Search Engines And Other Sites**

Search engines and other sites not associated with FindTheBest - including [Google](http://www.google.com/), [Archive](http://www.archive.org/), and [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/) \- archive or may make available cached copies of [FindTheBest](http://www.findthebest.com/) Listings; we have no control over their policies and practices in the archiving and display of this information.

**Situations In Which We May Release Information**

Listing data is designed to be data available for public viewing. At times this data may be shared with partners – by express choice. We may disclose information about our users if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process.

We may also disclose information about our users to law enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.findthebest.com/terms); respond to claims that any Listing or other content violates the rights of third-parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users or the general public at large.
