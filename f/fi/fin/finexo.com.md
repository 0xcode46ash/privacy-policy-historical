# Our Privacy Policy â€” FXUC

Your privacy on the internet is very important to us. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our clients. As part of the operation of .com we gather certain types of information about .com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you can correct or change the information. Please note that this policy applies only to .com and not to other companies or organisations to which we link.

Information collected by .com

### .com collects two types of information from our users:

  * Personal information, such as names, addresses, email addresses etc., and
  * Traffic pattern information on .com



Personal information is collected when our users provide personal information to .com upon registering for membership or when applying on-line for an account. We will limit the collection of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business in an effort to provide you with superior service.

Traffic pattern information includes information on which pages users access or visit, and how many users log into .com on a daily basis. This kind of information is only used in its aggregated form.

### Use of cookies

.com uses cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard disk for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow .com to measure activity on the website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the website without re-registering. Cookies are also used by .com to measure activity on the website and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.

.com does not use cookies to retrieve information which was not originally sent in a cookie. Apart from personal information voluntarily provided by you, .com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes.

### Use of information collected by .com

.com uses both the personal and aggregated information that we collect for multiple purposes.

The information is used:

  * To improve the content of the website
  * To customise the content and/or the layout of the website for each individual user
  * To notify users about updates to the website
  * To send out newsletters or information about other opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.



.com may share traffic pattern information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.

.com may also share personal information with pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

.com may also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required, or in order to protect our rights.

### How to correct your information with .com

If you need to change your personal information on .com or correct an error, please use the "Edit Your Profile" page to update your records. You find it in the main menu under "Member Menu".
