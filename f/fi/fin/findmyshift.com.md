# Privacy policy » Findmyshift

## What data does Findmyshift store?

As a general rule we try to keep personal information about you and your business to a minimum, only storing what is necessary for the system to function. This is why most data fields in the system are optional.

When signing up as a manager for your free trial we ask for your email address, your first name, a password and a name for your schedule. You have the option to enter email addresses and mobile telephone numbers for staff so you can communicate directly with them via the website, however these contact details are not required.

Apart from storing all data entered by managers and staff, Findmyshift also stores support emails, access logs and error logs. This helps us ensure the site is operating as expected. Detailed access logs which include the IP address of the user may be kept for up to a week before being removed. Payments are processed by PayPal (a third party payment provider) so no credit card details are ever handled or stored by Findmyshift. It is not known how long PayPal stores your payment details for and (as a third party service) their privacy policy will differ from ours.

## What does Findmyshift do with your information?

Findmyshift only ever uses your data for generating your schedule and reports. We don’t share, sell or export your data to any third party that is not directly involved in the delivery of this service. Findmyshift will never use personal data for marketing or business development and will only contact you if necessary for administrative or operational purposes associated with your subscription.

Unless troubleshooting a problem with your service, Findmyshift staff will only ever access your data when authorised by you to do so.

## How does Findmyshift safeguard your data?

Ensuring that your data is secure is very important and we take this responsibility seriously. As a result, all sensitive data you enter is encrypted, including your password, your name and your contact details. All the data associated with your account and your schedules is stored on our servers in a highly secured, world class data centre, protected by a number of layers of physical security.

Furthermore, every 24 hours all customer data is backed up, encrypted and archived to two secure off-site locations.

Findmyshift is also registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (Reg. No. Z3140758) and is fully compliant with the UK’s Data Protection Act, which is in line with most international information protection laws and regulations.

## Can I delete my data?

If you signed up for the free one month trial and haven’t signed up as a customer, your schedule and all data entered will be deleted from our servers after 90 days of inactivity, so no action is required from you. If you’re an existing customer and are thinking of leaving us, please [get in touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523022754id_/http%3A//www.findmyshift.com/contact-us) to discuss any concerns you might have about leaving your data within Findmyshift.
