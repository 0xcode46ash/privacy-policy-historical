Privacy Policy

FIND.COM respects the privacy of those who use FIND.COM's search services ("FIND.COM Search Services"). Information that relates to any individual will not be not intentionally disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). 

FIND.COM and Cookies 

When you first visit FIND.COM, FIND.COM sets a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a small file that identifies you as a unique user. FIND.COM uses cookies for performing searches. These cookies contain only an amonimus iunique number requires for persistent session. FIND.COM will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

What Information Do We Collect? 

FIND.COM does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. FIND.COM notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, FIND.COM may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.  


Links to Other Sites 

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by FIND.COM Search Services are developed by people over whom FIND.COM exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. FIND.COM may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When FIND.COM uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to FIND.COM, and FIND.COM in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. FIND.COM uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of FIND.COM's search technology. For instance, FIND.COM uses this information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.   


With Whom Does FIND.COM Share Information? 

FIND.COM may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average FIND.COM user visits FIND.COM, or which other query words are most often used with the query word "Linux." Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.   


Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy 

By using the FIND.COM Search Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our [Terms of Service Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20051118190926id_/http%3A//www.find.com/Home/About.aspx?page=terms_and_conditions.htm). FIND.COM may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
