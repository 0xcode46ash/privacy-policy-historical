## Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

The FOIA generally provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, of access to federal agency records, except to the extent that such records (or portions thereof) are protected from disclosure by one of nine exemptions.

The Privacy Act (PA) regulates the federal government's collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information about U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Among the rights afforded under the Privacy Act is an individual's right to obtain copies of records maintained on him/her if the information contained in agency files, retrievable by the individual's name or other identifier, is not exempt from release under the provisions of the law.

All requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) should be submitted to the Office of Freedom of Information. Directions on how to submit a FOIA request are available online, along with additional information on the Office of Freedom of Informationâs FOIA program, at <http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/dfoipo/>.

The FOIA known by its legal cite as 5 U.S.C. 552, along with the Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5400.7-R, "Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program," can be found at Part 286 of Chapter 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which is available in most libraries. It can also be purchased from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.
