Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard request for a World Wide Web document: 

_xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]  
"GET /site name/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" 200 16704   
Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com_

_xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)_ –this is the host name (or IP address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor). In this case, xxx.yyy.com, the request is coming from a commercial address. Depending on the requestor's method of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or may not identify a specific computer. 

Connections via many Internet Service Providers assign different IP addresses for each session, so the host name identifies only the ISP. The host name (or IP address) will identify a specific computer if that computer has a fixed IP address. 

_[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]_ –this is the date and time of the request 

_"GET /site name/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0"_ –this is the location of the requested file 

_200_ –this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled 

_16704_ –this is the size of the requested file in bytes 

_Mozilla 3.0_ –this identifies the type of browser software used to access the page, which indicates what design parameters to use in constructing the pages 

_www.altavista.digital.com_ –this indicates the last site the person visited, which indicates how people find this site 

Requests for other types of documents use similar information. No other user-identifying information is collected. 

## Viewers

Documents on this site are made available in several formats, based on a combination of factors, including the format of the original document, whether the look of the original document needs to be preserved, the availability of visitors to open different formats, and accessibility for those with physical limitations. This does not constitute endorsement of one commercial product over another. Note our disclaimer for external links.
