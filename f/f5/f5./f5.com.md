# Privacy Policy

This policy is effective January 28, 2014

Welcome to the web site for F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5"). F5’s web site is comprised of various web pages, collectively the “web site.” F5 believes that the confidentiality of customer information is one of its fundamental responsibilities. This Privacy Policy governs F5’s data collection and usage. Please review the Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of the web site constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions and notices. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the web site or provide any personal information. 

F5 limits the collection, retention and use of customer information to what F5 believes is necessary or useful to conduct its business, provide quality service and offer products and services of interest to its customers. The following sections describe how F5 collects, retains and uses customer information. Additional specifics on how DevCentral collects and uses such information is provided at the bottom.

F5 uses commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your personal information, and uses reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of business partners to take steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information F5 shares with them. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure.

### Collection and retention of customer information

F5 collects the following information:

  * F5 collects personally identifiable customer information from registration forms, including information requests, software downloads, webcast registrations and training requests. For instance, F5 collects personal information needed to process registration and login information for the DevCentral web site, as well as personal information in connection with online requests for literature, applications and forms, and use of online tools. 
  * F5 collects information that is not personally identifiable to the user, such as referring URL addresses, time spent in certain areas of the site, and origination of the user.
  * Some information about your computer hardware and software is automatically collected. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, and access times. This information is used by F5 for operating the web site, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the web site.
  * If you are providing payment through the F5 web site, no credit or debit card information is stored on F5 servers; such information is stored by our PCI-compliant third-party payment processors, Recurly and Authorize.net. All credit and debit card transactions occur between the computer originating the transaction and our payment processor



### How F5 uses the information

The personal information (e.g., name and address) F5 requires when you request or download information is used only to service your account and provide you with information on F5 products and services. Unless you choose to identify yourself in responding to a request for information on the web site, you will remain anonymous to F5. Any personal information that is collected is used to provide service to you in connection with your use of the web site and is not shared with third parties, except for F5 partners, as described in the Privacy Policy.

F5 may also use aggregated user data from these web tools as part of research to develop new web features, tools, and content, and for market research related to its products.

### Third parties with Whom F5 share information

The majority of F5 products are sold through its business partners (resellers, distributors, etc.). In order to transact business, F5 shares limited information with the F5 partners that resell F5 products. F5 also works with business partners to provide specific services, such as sending newsletters, providing software downloads or product deliveries, or handling credit or debit card transactions. F5 provide these partners limited customer information such as name, company name and address.

In addition, F5 will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on F5 or the web site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of F5; or, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of F5, or the public.

F5 does not rent or sell customer information to unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of marketing their products or services to you.

### Use of cookies

F5 understands that re-entering personal data to transmit a request can be time consuming. For example, F5 asks you to fill out information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register at AskF5, DevCentral or when requesting literature. F5 uses cookies on various pages of its web site to identify users and prepare customized web pages for them. When you log in, F5 sends you a cookie with a unique identifier. F5 uses this cookie to remember who you are each time you view a new web page on the web site. Cookies are used in a similar manner on other pages of its web site where information is requested from you, such as forms for service or literature requests. F5 also uses cookies in connection with satisfaction surveys and web traffic monitoring. Satisfaction survey cookies help us prevent the same surveys from reappearing the next time you visit the web site. Web traffic monitoring cookies help us analyze your past browsing behavior of the web site. Some of the cookies sent from the web site may expire upon logging-off (e.g., AskF5, DevCentral, requested service form/requested literature related cookies), some may persist for only a limited amount of time, 30 days or more, before expiring (e.g., satisfaction survey related cookies), and some may persist indefinitely (e.g., web traffic monitoring related cookies).

If you prefer to not receive cookies while browsing the web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting them and refuse the cookie(s) when your browser warns you, or you can set your browser to refuse all cookies from the web site (or certain parts of the web site), and/or you can delete cookies received from the web site using your browser, for instance. Cookie handling instructions vary depending on the particular browser being used, and F5 does not assume responsibility for any undesired results arising from altering your browser's cookie handling settings.

Although you do not need to accept all cookies from the web site or you may choose to delete any cookies received from the web site, some cookies may be needed to use/navigate through parts of the web site before certain actions can be performed (e.g., accessing portions of the web site requiring login and password), to enable F5 to collect/analyze accurate repeat web site visitor behavior information, or to prevent the same surveys from reappearing upon subsequent visits by you. Turning cookies off, refusing the cookies, or deleting cookies received from the web site may prevent you from taking full advantage or in some cases even from accessing certain portions of the web site, and may hinder our efforts to better understand your needs and provide you with customized content.

### Surveys

Occasionally, F5 conducts surveys regarding the web site or other products or services. The information you provide is used collectively for analytical purposes. You will not receive unsolicited communications as a result of your participation in a survey if you notify us not to contact you.

### Links to Other Sites

On the web site, F5 may provide links to third parties that provide articles and other information that may be of interest to you.
