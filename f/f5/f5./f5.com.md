F5 Networks Privacy Policy

_This policy is effective June 1, 2004_

**Keeping your trust:** We believe that confidentiality of customer information is one of our fundamental responsibilities. While information is critical in providing quality service, we recognize that one of the most important assets is our customers' trust. 

**Use, collection and retention of customer information:** F5 Networks limits the use, collection and retention of customer information to what we believe is necessary or useful to conduct our business, provide quality service and offer products and services of interest to our customers. We collect personally identifiable customer information from our registration forms, including information requests, software downloads, Webcast registrations and training requests. 

**Who we share information with:** The majority of F5 products are sold through our business partners (resellers, distributors, etc.). In order to transact business, we share limited information with the F5 partners who resell F5 products. We also work with business partners to provide specific services, such as sending newsletters, providing software downloads or product deliveries. We provide these partners limited customer information such as name, company name and address. We may disclose personal information as we believe is required by law. Other than as described in this section, F5 does not rent or sell customer information to unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of marketing their products or services to you.

**You have a choice:** We are sensitive to the fact that some of our customers prefer not to receive offers or product promotions from F5. Customers who do not wish to receive these offers may have their names removed at any time from future solicitations. To remove your name from future mailings, please send your request to [remove@f5.com](mailto:remove@f5.com) or in writing to F5 Networks, 401 Elliot Ave. West, Seattle, WA 98119 Attn: Marketing.

**Help us keep accurate records:** F5 understands the importance of maintaining accurate customer records. Please help us keep your records accurate by contacting us at [updateinfo@f5.com](mailto:updateinfo@f5.com)

**Questions:** F5 Networks recognizes and respects the privacy expectations of our customers. We want our customers to understand our commitment to privacy. If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, please email us at [privacy@f5.com](more:privacy@f5.com).

F5 Networks Online Privacy Policy

_This policy is effective June 1, 2004_

**Information Collected:** F5 Networks collects personal information needed to process your registration and login as well as personal information in connection with online requests for literature, applications and forms, and use of online tools. We also collect information which is not personally identifiable to the user, such as referring URL addresses, time spent in certain areas of the site, and origination of the user. 

**Use of Personal Data:** The personal information (e.g., name and address) we require when you request or download information is used only to service your account and provide you with information on F5 Networks products and services. Unless you choose to identify yourself in responding to a request for information on our Web site, you will remain anonymous to us. Any personal information that is collected is used to service you in connection with your use of our Web site and is not shared with third parties, except for our partners, as described in the General Privacy Policy.

We may also use aggregated user data from these Web tools as part of research to develop new Web features, tools, and content, and for market research related to our products.

F5 Networks understands that re-entering personal data to transmit a request can be time consuming. For example, we ask you to fill out information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register at Ask F5, DevCentral or when requesting literature. F5 Networks uses cookies on various pages of its Web site to identify users and prepare customized Web pages for them. When you log in, we send you a cookie with a unique identifier. We use this cookie to remember who you are each time you view a new Web page on our site. Each time you log off, that identifier expires. Cookies are used in a similar manner on other pages of our Web site where information is requested from you, such as forms for service or literature requests.

**E-mail:** F5 Networks does not sell its customers' e-mail addresses to third parties. We may disclose customers' e-mail addresses to business partners that perform marketing services for us as described in the General Policy. E-mail addresses you provide are used only to service your account and provide you with information on F5 Networks products and services. You may opt out from any promotional emails as described in the You Have a Choice section above.

**Surveys:** Occasionally, we conduct surveys regarding our Web site or other products or services. The information you provide is used collectively for analytical purposes. You will not receive unsolicited communications as a result of your participation in a survey if you notify us not to contact you. 

**Links to Other Sites:** On our Web site, we may provide links to third parties that provide articles and other information which may be of interest to you. Should you choose to visit these sites, you should read their privacy policies to understand what information they collect from you and how they use it. 

**Notification of Changes:** F5 will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will update the revision date at the top of this statement.
