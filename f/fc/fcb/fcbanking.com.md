FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION PRIVACY POLICY FOR CONSUMERS

What you should know

We recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and confidential. There is some important information we want you to know.

  1. Unlike many other financial institutions, we do not sell or share Client Information with marketers outside First Commonwealth who may want to offer you their own products and services. 

  2. We do not control advertising (mail, telephone or e-mail) you receive from companies outside First Commonwealth. You can reduce outside advertising by contacting the Direct Marketing Association and the credit reporting bureaus. 

  3. We carefully manage information among our companies. Understanding your relationship with First Commonwealth allows us to serve you better and offer you more convenience and benefits. 




This policy covers Client Information, which means personally identifiable information about a consumer or a consumer's current or former relationship with First Commonwealth, including the companies listed under the section First Commonwealth Companies. 

This policy is provided to you annually as required by the Federal Financial Privacy Law. 

If you previously exercised your option to limit the sharing of Client Information among First Commonwealth Companies, you don't need to take any additional action. We will continue to honor your request. 

Protecting information about you from marketers outside First Commonwealth 

First Commonwealth does not sell or otherwise share any Client Information with marketers outside of First Commonwealth who may want to offer you their own products and services. You don't need to take any action to prevent disclosure of this information. 

Making the security of information a priority

Keeping financial information secure is one of our most important responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect Client Information. Employees are authorized to access Client Information only when they have a reasonable business need for the information. Our employees are required to give confidential treatment to Client Information and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so. 

Collecting information 

We collect and use various types of information to service your accounts, save you time and money, and better respond to your needs. 

Client Information is categorized as the following four types: 

  1. Application Information \- information, such as your assets, income and debt, which you provide to us on applications and through other means. 

  2. Transaction and Experience Information \- information about your transactions and account experience, such as your account balances, payment history, and parties to transactions; or information about our communications with you, such as requests for copies of checks and our responses. 

  3. Consumer Report Information \- information from a consumer report, such as your creditworthiness or credit history. 

  4. Information from Outside Sources \- information from outside sources regarding their employment, credit and other relationships with you or verifying representations made by you, such as your employment history, loan balances and your property insurance.




Managing Information 

We manage how and when information is shared: 

  * Within First Commonwealth

  * With companies that work for us

  * In other situations 




Managing Information within First Commonwealth 

First Commonwealth is made up of a number of companies, including financial service providers such as our bank and our insurance agency; and non-financial companies such as our data processing and professional services subsidiaries. Please refer to the section First Commonwealth Companies for a current list of our companies that may receive or share information about consumer client relationships. 

First Commonwealth may share all four types of Client Information among our companies. For example, if you have an account with one of our companies and would like to open an account with another of our companies, we may share information you have provided to us. Sharing this information could save you time in opening your new account because you might not need to furnish the same information twice. Sharing information also enhances our ability to protect your accounts against fraudulent activity on an account. For example, we may use information about your ATM and debit card transactions to identify any unusual activity, and then contact you to determine if your card has been lost or stolen. 

We occasionally receive medical or health information about a client if, for example, a client applies for insurance from us. We do not share medical or health information among our companies except to maintain accounts, process transactions, service client requests, or perform insurance functions.

Managing Information with companies that work for us 

We may share any of the four types of Client Information outlined above with companies that work for us. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential, and use the Client Information that we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. These companies may include financial service providers such as asset management companies, and nonfinancial companies such as check printing and data processing companies. These companies might assist us, for example, in fulfilling your service requests and processing your transactions. In addition, we may share any of the four types of Client Information with financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. 

Managing Information in other situations 

We may also share any of the four types of Client Information to credit bureaus and similar organizations, and when required or permitted by law. For example, Client Information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud investigation, recording mortgages in public records, or the sale of your account to another financial institution. We may also share any of the four types of Client Information outside First Commonwealth if we have your consent, such as when we respond to your service requests. 

Honoring your preferences 

You have a choice when it comes to how First Commonwealth shares certain types of Client Information. 

Â  | 

Sharing among First Commonwealth companies 

You may request that Application Information, Consumer Report Information or Information from Outside Sources not be shared among First Commonwealth companies. However, through the normal course of doing business, we will continue to share Transaction and Experience Information among our companies to service your accounts and better meet your financial needs. 

If you do not want First Commonwealth to share Application Information, Consumer Report Information or Information from Outside Sources among First Commonwealth Companies, you can tell us that is your preference by:

  1. Calling us toll-free at 1.888.711.2265 and using our Convenience Banking Line. You will need a touch-tone phone for this option. 

  2. Calling us toll-free at 1.800.711.BANK and talking with a Convenience Banking Center representative. 

  3. Talking to a client representative at your local community office or your client relationship manager. 




Your Social Security number will be requested in order to assure that your preference is honored across all your accounts. 

To help you understand how we record your preference about sharing Client Information, you should know that: 

  * Your preference will be honored among all First Commonwealth Companies

  * You may receive more than one copy of the Privacy Policy. However, once you have told us about your preference, it will remain in effect until you tell us to change it. 

  * If you have joint accounts, we will treat a request by one party to the account as applying to all parties to the account. A preference will apply to accounts that each joint account holder has in his or her name and any accounts the joint account holders have with each other. 

  * Since some marketing programs may already be in progress, it may take a short time for your preference to be fully effective.

Making sure information is accurate 

Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. We provide you with access to your account information through various means, such as account statements, Telephone Banking and Internet Banking. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call or write us at the telephone number or address listed on your account statement, bank records, or other documentation. We will promptly update or correct any erroneous information. If you have questions or feel that we have not handled information about you properly, you may contact us and we will investigate your inquiry or complaint.
