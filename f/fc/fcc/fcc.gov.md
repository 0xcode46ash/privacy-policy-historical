Access for People with Disabilities 

The FCC is committed to making the electronic technologies we deploy accessible to individuals with disabilities. In this effort, we work with the Access Board, an independent Federal agency devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities. The Access Board established Federal standards for electronic and information technology under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. We incorporate Section 508 compliance testing in the design, development and maintenance of our website. The Commission's work on accessible design is continuous, and we welcome [feedback](mailto:webmaster@fcc.gov) on improving the accessibility features of our site. To learn more about actions the FCC is taking to ensure that new technologies are accessible, visit our [Disability Rights Office web page](http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/dro/).

  


Customer Service Standards 

You will always be treated with courtesy and can expect these [Standards of Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20051215081652id_/http%3A//www.fcc.gov/css.html) when interacting with us.

  


Freedom of Information Act 

The Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as the FOIA, ([5 U.S.C. § 552](https://web.archive.org/fcc-bin/bye?http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/foiastat.htm)), was enacted by Congress in 1966 to give the American public greater access to the Federal Government's records. Congress has since expanded the scope of the FOIA to encompass electronic records. However, you do not have to file a FOIA request to obtain information which is routinely available for public inspection, including records from docketed cases, broadcast applications and related files, petitions for rulemakings, various legal and technical publications, legislative history compilations, etc. _See_ 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.453 and 0.455. Much of this information is available on our website. Visit the [FCC FOIA Home Page](http://www.fcc.gov/foia/) for an informal explanation of the FOIA process at the FCC.

  


Information Quality Guidelines & Notice 

The FCC is dedicated to ensuring that all data it disseminates reflect a level of quality commensurate with the nature and timeliness of the information. Futher, the FCC seeks to disseminate all its data as broadly and promptly as possible so that the public can benefit from the FCC's work of ensuring vital and innovative communication services are available to all Americans at reasonable prices. In keeping with this commitment, and in accordance with OMB requirements, the FCC has developed [Information Quality Guidelines](http://www.fcc.gov/omd/dataquality/) and provides the public the opportunity to [comment](http://www.fcc.gov/omd/dataquality/complaint/) if those guidelines are not followed."

The FCC makes every effort to insure that the information on this website is accurate. There may, however, be recent rule changes that have not yet been posted to the website or inadvertent errors in the content. The FCC will promptly modify the website information to ensure that the information posted is current, or to correct errors in content brought to the Commission's attention. In the event there is any conflict between information posted on this website and the Commission's rules, the rules shall prevail.

On May 15, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination and Retaliation (No Fear) Act, which increases federal agency accountability for acts of discrimination or reprisal against employees. Visit our [No Fear Act Web Page](http://www.fcc.gov/owd/no-fear-act.html) to view the Equal Employment Opportunity Data that the FCC posts pursuant to the No Fear Act.

  


Paperwork Reduction Act & FCC Information Collections 

The FCC collects many different kinds of information from the public. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Part 35) requires the Commission, as well as other federal agencies, to get Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before collecting most kinds of information. The FCC currently has over 500 approved information collections. Once OMB approves a collection the FCC must ask OMB to renew its approval at least once every three years for as long as the collection is needed. These renewals are known as extensions. The Commission must also request OMB approval whenever it makes a significant change to a collection. Read more about [FCC Information Collections and the Paperwork Reduction Act](http://www.fcc.gov/omd/pra/).

  


Plug-ins, Players & Readers 

The FCC provides information on its web site in a variety of file formats that best match the transmittal and display requirements of the information, while taking into account the level of resources typically available to its visitors. Most of these file formats are easily read and displayed by standard web browsers or word processing programs, but some files whose formats have been specifically developed for transmitting and displaying special content, such as multimedia or very precisely defined documents, may require the use of additional software to be presented correctly. Visit our [Plug-ins, Players and Readers Web Page](http://www.fcc.gov/plug-ins.html) for more information and links for downloading the required software.

  


We respect your right to privacy and will protect it when you visit our website.

The FCC website is an official United States Government System, which may be used only for authorized purposes. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on FCC servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. The Government may monitor or audit the usage of this system, and all persons are hereby notified that use of this system constitutes consent to such monitoring and auditing.

E-Authentication. Confidence in the security of information exchanged over the Internet plays a vital role in E-Government. E-Authentication supports E-Government by helping to enable trust in online exchanges between entities and government. E-Authentication at FCC focuses on confirming a person’s identity, based on the reliability of his or her credential when using an FCC web-based system. The FCC conducted an E-Authentication assessment of its web-based systems. The results of the 2005 and 2004 E-Authentication assessments are summarized and may be obtained by request via email: [E-Authentication@fcc.gov](mailto:E-Authentication@fcc.gov). This notice is presented in compliance with Office of Management and Budget's "[E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies](http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/bye?http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf)".

  


Website Inventory, Priorities & Schedules 

The FCC maintains an inventory of FCC website content and associated on-line publication schedules and priorities, as required by Section 207(f)(2) of the E-Government Act of 2002. See our complete [Website Inventory, Priorities & Schedules page](http://www.fcc.gov/webinventory/) for more information.

  


Web Site Maintenance Policy & Schedule 

We strive to make the FCC’s network and on-line systems highly reliable and available. Toward this end, we must periodically bring down systems for service, software updates, repairs, routine maintenance and performance tuning. Accordingly, we have established a weekly network maintenance window - Sunday 10:00pm to Monday 6:00am (Eastern Time) – when some or all FCC systems might be brought down for maintenance work. While this work is essential, we also recognize that it presents an inconvenience for those of you who use our on-line systems. If at any given time maintenance is not required for that week, the Sunday maintenance window will be cancelled and a notification will be posted under the [FCC Network Infrastructure Status](http://www.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/EFBoards/systemstatus.cgi?index_t=../../pub/e-file/messages/ITC.html). On those occasions when it is necessary to bring down all systems, the appropriate notification will be posted in the same place.
