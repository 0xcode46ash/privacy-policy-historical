**Disclaimer of Endorsement**  
This Internet site contains hypertext links to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations. These links are provided for your convenience. The Federal Communications Commission does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of this outside information. Further, the inclusion of links to particular items in hypertext are not intended to reflect their importance, nor is it intended to endorse any views expressed or products or service offered on these outside sites, or the organizations sponsoring the sites.

**Security Notice**  
You are entering an official United States Government System, which may be used only for authorized purposes. Unauthorized modification of any information on this system may result in criminal prosecution. The Government may monitor or audit the usage of this system, and all persons are hereby notified that use of this system constitutes consent to such monitoring and auditing.

**Privacy Notice**  
The Federal Communications Commission provides this Internet site as a public service. We do not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit this site unless you choose to provide such information to us.

The FCC posts a Privacy Act notice at those places on this site where the Commission needs to collect any individually identifiable information for use by the FCC.

Any information collected within the context of your email inquiry or comment is used only for the expressed purpose of responding to your inquiry or comment. We collect personally identifiable information only if specifically and knowingly provided by you.

For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. This information is not expressed in any form that would reveal personally identifiable information.

The FCC provides numerous online software programs that support the Universal Licensing System, Antenna Structure Registration, Auctions, and other FCC functions. When a user visits the FCC web site to perform a transaction (sending an application, initiating a query, receiving a query response, etc), the web server receives data or sends a response and then may send a cookie prior to breaking the connection with the user. A cookie is a small piece of software that is placed by a web server on users’ personal computers and is then used to personalize the site when a visitor returns. A transaction or session, may involve a number of such information exchanges, each followed by a break in the connection. In order to maintain the state (where one is in the process) of a transaction, the FCC web sites may place session cookies in memory allocated to users’ browsers. Session cookies permit the users to perform transactions as if they were connected to the FCC web site throughout the course of the transactions or sessions. Session cookies are erased from the users’ systems when they close their browsers.

**Freedom of Information Act**  
The Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as the FOIA, ([5 U.S.C. § 552](https://web.archive.org/fcc-bin/bye?http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/foiastat.htm)), was enacted by Congress in 1966 to give the American public greater access to the Federal Government's records. Congress has since expanded the scope of the FOIA to encompass electronic records. However, you do not have to file a FOIA request to obtain information which is routinely available for public inspection, including records from docketed cases, broadcast applications and related files, petitions for rulemakings, various legal and technical publications, legislative history compilations, etc. _See_ 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.453 and 0.455. Much of this information is available on our website. Visit the [FCC FOIA Home Page](https://web.archive.org/foia/) for an informal explanation of the FOIA process at the FCC.
