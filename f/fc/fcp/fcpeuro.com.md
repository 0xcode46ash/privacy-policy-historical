# Privacy Policy

FCP respects the privacy of every individual who visits this Web site (the “Site”). We have created this Privacy Statement to inform you of the information collection practices for this Site, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. Please carefully read this Privacy Statement and revisit it from time to time as it may periodically be revised. By using this Site, you indicate your understanding and acceptance of these terms. If you do not accept these terms, you may not use this Site.  
Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect

In general, you can visit this Site without identifying yourself or revealing any personally identifiable information. There are times, however, that you may choose to give us personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or other information about yourself. For example, if you would like to place an order you will need to provide us with your e-mail address, billing and shipping addresses, and payment information. Another example would be if in response to employment opportunities at FCP, you e-mail your resume to us. We also provide you with the opportunity to e-mail us questions or comments about this Site and our company.  
Our Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

We only use and store the personally identifiable information which is provided by you through this Site to help us improve our services to you, to provide you with the information you have requested, to respond to your questions or resume submission, and for other internal purposes. FCP will not give or sell your personally identifiable information to any organization other than a direct affiliate. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of FCP or other entities in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for FCP. FCP may also use your personally identifiable information for disclosures that are required by law.  
Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically

In some cases, we may collect information that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of internet browser or computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our Site or advertisement. FCP does not collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie information collected automatically to your previously submitted personally identifiable information.

In addition, some pages on this Site may use “cookies” – small files that the Site places on your hard drive for identification purposes. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID to track the pages you visit, but the only personal information a cookie contains is information that you supply. Note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive. These files are used for site registration and customization the next time you visit us. Some parts of the Site may also use cookies to track your traffic patterns. We do this to help us understand the usefulness of our Site, the effectiveness of our navigational structure, and to develop enhancements to the Site for your convenience.

Any non-personally identifiable comments, suggestions, or other communications you send to us will be treated as non-confidential unless you state otherwise. FCP, each of its affiliates and/or their designees may use any or all user communications for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, reproduction, transmission, disclosure, publication, broadcast, development, manufacturing and/or marketing in any manner whatsoever for any or all commercial or non-commercial purposes. FCP may, but is not obligated to, monitor or review any information you provide through this Web Site. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this Site any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, offensive, pornographic, or other material that would violate any law.  
Changes to Information

We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to correct inaccuracies in your personal information. To correct inaccuracies in your personal information please send us an email to info@fcpgroton.com.

From time to time, this Site may contain links to other Web sites. If you use these links, you will leave this Site. We encourage you to read and understand those Web sites’ policies prior to using those Web sites. Neither FCP nor its affiliates are responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
