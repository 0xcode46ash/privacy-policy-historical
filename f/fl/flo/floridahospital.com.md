# Privacy Policy | Florida Hospital

Thanks for visiting our website. Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. d/b/a Florida Hospital appreciates your interest in our company and health care facilities. We urge you to read our Privacy Policy / Terms and Conditions of Use (“Privacy Policy”) so that you will know how we maintain and protect any information that you may give us through our website.

Please also remember that your use of our website means that you have agreed to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Receive

We receive information in different ways through our website. The information we receive from users of our website can be categorized as being either anonymous, personally identifiable, or protected health information.

## Anonymous Information; Log Files

Anonymous information refers to information that cannot be tied to a specific individual. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Many persons who access our website do not use the personalization features or member services that are available to them through our website, and therefore these individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect from them does not enable us to identify them in any personal way. For example, we may know that 5,000 users visit our website every day and that 3,000 of them reside in Florida, but we may not know their names or where they live. All anonymous information we collect through our website is collected when your web browser accesses our website. When you surf the Internet, your web browser automatically transmits information about your preferences to our server every time you visit our website. The anonymous information collected by us through your web browser helps us to monitor audience size, measure traffic patterns and identify popular services and information within our website. We use this information to improve our services to you and to help develop improved services based on user interests, behavior and demographics. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable or protected health information.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information refers to information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, age, etc. In many cases, we ask for this information to provide the personalization feature or member service you wish to use. The amount of personally identifiable information that we know about you is entirely up to you. We will only know personally identifiable information if you choose to share this information about yourself; however, some features or services may not be available unless we obtain a certain amount of personally identifiable information.

We collect personally identifiable information when you voluntarily provide it when, for example, requesting a newsletter that we produce, indicating that you would like to receive certain targeted information on topics that interest you, applying for classes or donating money through our on-line foundation.

## Protected Health Information

Protected health information, for purposes of this website, refers to the information you provide when, for example, you pay your health care bills online, make an appointment, or pre-register for a health care service, and is further explained under our [Notice of Patient Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/hipaa).

## Cookies

In addition, we may also collect information through the use of "cookies". When you visit our website for the first time, our server sends a cookie to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. A cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number that is sent from us and stored on your computer. Cookies enable us to recognize your web browser whenever you visit our website through the unique identification number assigned to the cookie, and this information is stored to help facilitate your use of the website the next time you visit.

If you wish to find out how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to disable cookies altogether and how to monitor when you receive a new cookie, check the "help" feature of your web browser. However, not accepting or disabling cookies from our website may prevent you from accessing certain parts of our website.

We may share anonymous information with third parties. For example, we may match our user information, such as gender and age preferences and usage, with data of these third parties to help develop additional products and services to offer through our website.

As a general rule, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any unaffiliated third party, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we need to treat the information collected through this website as an asset in the event of the merger or sale of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. d/b/a Florida Hospital, or a portion of our business. Your personally identifiable information may be accessed by our management information services team or an affiliated third party providing technical support or maintenance for us.

If we offer services using or in conjunction with an unaffiliated third party, we may need to share some or all of your personally identifiable information with that unaffiliated third party for purposes of providing the services to you. If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be shared, you can choose not to use that particular feature or service.

In some circumstances we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information. We will do so, in good faith, only to the extent we believe to be required by law. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a third party who may be violating our terms and conditions governing the use of our website, or who may be (intentionally or unintentionally) causing injury to or interference with your or our rights or property or those of a third party.

We reserve the right to treat anonymous and personally identifiable information collected through this website as an asset which may be transferred to a third party in connection with the merger or sale of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. d/b/a Florida Hospital, or a portion of our business.

### Protected Health Information

The use and disclosure of protected health information is governed by the terms and conditions of our [Notice of Patient Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/hipaa).
