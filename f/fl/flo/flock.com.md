# Flock Privacy Policy

Written May 24, 2006

Your privacy is important to us. This document outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use the Flock.com web site or the Flock browser, how we use this information, and some of the steps we take to safeguard your privacy.

**Why we (and others) collect information about you**

To improve your experience on the Flock.com web site, we keep track of certain information as you use the site. For certain sections of the site, such as our discussion forums and bug tracking repository, we require you to register and log in, in order to facilitate communication.

We do not require that you provide any personally-identifying information when using the Flock browser. Like all web browsers, Flock collects limited, non-personally identifying information that your browser makes available to the web sites you visit, whenever you visit a website, such as your IP address, information about the browser you use, and what operating system your computer uses. This information is collected by web servers to ensure that you are provided with the most appropriate version of web pages.

**What information we collect**

When you use the Flock.com web site, we require limited personal information from you in specific areas of the site. In these cases, you will be prompted for the information. For example, our discussion forums require you to register with an email address. When you visit the Flock.com web site, we also install a non-personally-identifiable cookie on your computer to help customize your experience on the web site. A cookie is a piece of data from your browser that identifies you as a unique user. If you do not wish to have cookies set on your computer, you can configure your browser to refuse cookies.

Like other browsers, Flock collects limited, non-personally identifying information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a web site (such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query, and build ID). The Flock browser also includes an update feature that checks our servers on a daily basis to ensure that you are running the latest version of our browser. This helps us ensure that you are running the most stable, secure and feature-rich version of the Flock browser. No personally-identifiable information is transmitted to our servers during this process. The auto-update feature can be disabled in our preferences menu.

You may enable various online services to be directly integrated into your Flock experience. By directly integrating these services into the browser, we make your online experiences richer, and more personalized. We will ask you to register for or log into the services on the web sites of their respective providers, such as Flickr, PhotoBucket, Delicious, Shadows, etc. These services will then collect information, and inform you about what information they collect, in accordance with their own terms of service. By agreeing to these terms of services, and by enabling them within the Flock browser, you are allowing us to pass this information back to these service providers. The Flock browser does not pass this information to Flock Inc. or our servers.

While most of the integrated services require that you register and log into the specific services, not all services require registration and logging in. Before enabling such services, we will notify you using our installation wizards, first run wizards and alert dialogs. If Yahoo Live Search results within the Flock search box are enabled, then we will send any information you type into the search box to Yahoo â€“ even if you do not hit the enter key and even if you set your default search engine to a provider other than Yahoo.

**Transfer of personal information**

Flock will not sell or rent any of your personal information to others. We may, however, disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law.

**Policy Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will announce material changes on our company blog, at <http://www.flock.com/blog>
