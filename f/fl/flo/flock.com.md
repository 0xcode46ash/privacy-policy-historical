# Flock Browser - Flock Privacy Policy | Flock

## Flock Privacy Policy

Flock takes your privacy seriously. This document outlines the types of personally identifying and other information we gather when you use the Flock.com web site, the Flock browser and other Flock products, services and forums (which may collectively be referred to as, “Flock Products”) and how we use and share this information.

## Why We Collect Information About You

We collect information in connection with your use of Flock Products in order to improve and personalize your experience with Flock Products and in some cases to facilitate communication with you regarding our products, services and community activities. The types of information we collect from our users is described below. 

## What Information We Collect

Flock Website: We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site, and, in some cases, we require certain personally identifying information from you in specific areas of our site in order for you to use certain Flock Products or features. In these cases, you will be prompted for the information we are collecting. For example, our discussion forums require you to register with an email address. 

As part of your use of our website, we also collect limited, non-personally identifying information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a web site (such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query, and build ID). In addition, we may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of users of our site and its components. Flock only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure to improve our site, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site.

In connection with your use of our site, we (like many other sites) will install a non-personally-identifiable cookie on your computer to help customize your experience on the web site. A cookie is a piece of data from your browser that identifies you as a unique user. If you do not wish to have cookies set on your computer, you can configure your browser to refuse cookies.

Flock Browser: The Flock browser includes an update feature that checks our servers on a daily basis to ensure that you are running the most stable, secure and feature-rich version of the Flock browser. The auto-update feature can be disabled in our preferences menu. In connection with the auto-update feature, the Flock browser also sends Flock non-personally identifying information about how our users are using the Flock browser and which features our most popular, enabling us to improve the Flock Products. If you do not wish to participate in this program you can decline it at install time or turn it off in the browser advanced preferences. (Further information to access Flock’s advanced preferences can be found by clicking [here](http://www.flock.com/faq/show/30#q_11592)) 

Integrated Services: You may enable various online services to be directly integrated into your Flock experience. By directly integrating these services into the browser, we make your online experiences more convenient, richer, and more personalized. To take advantage of these capabilities, we will ask you to register for or log into the services on the web sites of their respective providers. These services will then collect information, and inform you about what information they collect, in accordance with their own terms of service. By agreeing to those terms of services, and by enabling them within the Flock browser, you are allowing us to pass this information back to these service providers. The Flock browser does not pass this information to Flock Inc. or our servers. Flock shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party site or service that may be enabled within your Flock browser. While most of the integrated services require that you register and log into the specific services, not all services require registration and logging in. Services are enabled by your explicit actions in the Flock browser, such as logging in and/or choosing to remember or activate an account. If Live Search results within the Flock search box are enabled, then we will send any information you type into the search box to the Live Search provider – even if you do not hit the enter key and even if you set your default search engine to a provider other than the one for which you have enabled Live Search.

## Sharing of Personally Identifying Information 

Flock will not sell or rent any of your personally identifying information to others. To the extent we possess your personally identifying information, we only share it with your consent or as described below:

Agents: We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Flock's agents do not have any right to use personally identifying information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Flock’s business were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Flock may continue to use your personally identifying information as set forth in this policy.

Protection of Flock and Others: We may release personally identifying information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Flock, our employees, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
