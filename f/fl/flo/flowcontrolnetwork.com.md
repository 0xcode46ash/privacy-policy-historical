Our goal is to provide you with an experience that delivers the information and resources that are helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we collect information from you. We discuss our information collection practices below.  


This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy practices in effect at the GRAND VIEW MEDIA GROUP, INC. Web site. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access this Web site.  


WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND HOW IS IT USED?  


A. General Collection and Use of Personal Identifying Information  
We will only collect and use personal identifying information (such as a first and last name, physical address including a street name, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) when a user voluntarily provides it to us. In order to use some portions of our Web site, or in order to undertake certain actions, a user must first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require disclosure of personal identifying information. Such disclosure is strictly voluntary. In order to contact us by e-mail, however, you must provide an e-mail address.

We will use the personal identifying information we collect for limited internal purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, utilization for customer service, content processing, or content classification, and providing you with information concerning our services. We will retain this information. We also may use that personal identifying information to improve and customize our content.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal identifying information, if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.  


B. Collection of Non-Personal Identifying Information  
We collect and use non-personal identifying information, including IP addresses and web server log files to track trends, administer the Web site, track user movement, and gather demographic information. We use this non-personal identifying information in the aggregate, and to troubleshoot technical errors. We do not combine these types of non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information.
