**BURDA interactive communities (BURDA:ic) Privacy Policy**

We are deeply concerned with the protection of personal data. We would like you to know when we are saving which data and how we use them. As a company of civil law, we are subject to the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Treaty for Telemedia (TMG) of the Federal Republic of Germany. We took technical and organisational measures to ensure that the regulations on data protection are followed by us, as well as external service providers who are working for us.

 **Personal Data**

Personal data is information used to learn about your identity, including information like your real name, your address, zip code, phone number. Information not associated with your real identity (for example your favorite website or the number of users on a page) are not covered.

Parts of our online service (website) are usable without revealing your identity. As soon as you want to participate in games and the portal itself, you will be asked for your name and other private information. The following information will be asked:

  * Date of birth
  * Country of your residence
  * Your e-mail address



Your submitted information will be saved on esspecially protected servers in Germany. Only a few specifically authorized people who are involved in the technical, commercial or editorial care of the servers and the portal are able to access them.  


When you access our services, data which allows an identification (for example the IP address, date, time and pages looked at on our website) will be saved to our servers for backup purposes. No personal-related information will be processed. The statistical evaluation of anonymous data is reserved.

IP addresses will be saved for a period of 28 days when using our service as anonymous users. They are saved for data security purposes and to ensure the stability and the operational safety of our system. Data that is necessary for accounting is excepted from this limited saving procedure.

In case we provide third parties with information, they gain no access to the saved personal data. The administration of those is exclusive subject to BURDA:ic.  
  
 **Passing of Personal Data to Third Parties**

Your data will not be passed to third parties without your explicit approval. If your data is passed to other service providers due to the processing of data, these providers are bound to the BDSG, other statutory provisions and contractually to the Privacy Policy of BURDA:ic. As far as we are obliged via laws or judicial decree, your data can be passed to units entitled to receive information.

Articles posted in our forums are open to the public. Before posting you should check your posts whether they contain information not intended for the public. You need to face the possibility that your posts will be collected by search engines and thus become accessible worldwide without our service being used. Foreign service providers oftentimes cannot be ordered to erase or revise these kinds of entries.  
 **  
Right to Revoke**

You can delete your submitted personal data anytime. Data used for accounting and clearance purposes are not affected by cancelation and deletion.
