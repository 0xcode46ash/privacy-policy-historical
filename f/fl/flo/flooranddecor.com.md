### Does Floor and Decor use "cookies" and other tracking tools?

A cookie is a small data file that a website may send to your browser and that may then be stored on your hard drive. Our website uses cookies to simulate a continuous connection. Our cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our website without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies.

Our web server automatically collects the address of the website that you came from before visiting our website, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.

Our website may also use other technologies to track which pages on our website our visitors view. This non-identifiable click-stream data helps us understand how visitors use our website.

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies, and our site allows users to employ “do not track” settings. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, click <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/>.

These companies may use technologies similar to those outlined above to measure the effectiveness of ads and e-mails. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites so that we can provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For this purpose, we may also provide these third-party service providers anonymous information about your site navigation and purchases.
