# Flocabulary - Privacy-Policy

##### Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

When you fill out an online form or place an order, we may ask you for your name and email address as well as other necessary contact information. We collect only information that you voluntarily give us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to provide support or tell you about new products or services. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

##### Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. 

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.

##### Cookies

We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.
