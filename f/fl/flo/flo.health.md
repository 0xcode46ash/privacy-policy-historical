(“Company” or “we” or “us”) collects, stores, uses, transfers and discloses Personal Data from our users (“you”) in connection with the Flo fem ® mobile application, flo.health website, and related services (collectively, the “App”).

We reserve the right to and may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified when you register), through the App, or by presenting you with a new version of this Privacy Policy for you to accept, if we, for example, add new processing activities or collect some additional Personal Data from you.

Your continued use of the App after the effective date of an updated version of the Privacy Policy will indicate your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified. In some cases, you will have to explicitly accept changes to Privacy Policy to continue using the App. We encourage you to periodically review our website and the App for the latest information on our data privacy practices. If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, we ask that you do not use the App. Please exit the App immediately if you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

To the extent information covered by this Section is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Data”.

## 3\. Your rights

#### **Modification, correction and erasure**

You are able to modify, correct, erase, and update your Personal Data by writing us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com).

#### **Access**

You have a right to access your Personal Data you insert into the App and ask us about what kind of Personal Data we have about you. You can do this by using the app settings or by writing us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com).

#### **EU residents**

Individuals residing in the countries of the European Union have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data introduced by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request access to Personal data (including in a structured and portable form), as well as to seek to update, delete or correct Personal data:

а.  **Rectification of Personal Data and Restriction of Processing**. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your Personal Data that you submit to Flo. Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the Flo Web Sites and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy. If you believe that your Personal Data is inaccurate, you have right to contact us and ask us to correct such Personal Data by contacting us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com). You shall also have the right to request restriction of processing of your Personal Data, if you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data and we need some time to verify its accuracy.

b.  **Access to your Personal Data and Data Portability.** The App gives you the ability to access and update Personal Data within the App and your account settings. You shall have the right to request information about whether we have any Personal Data about you, to access your Personal data (including in a structured and portable form) by simply writing us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com).

c. **Erasure of your Personal Data.** If you believe that your Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed, or in cases where you have withdrawn your consent or object to the processing of your Personal Data, or in cases where the processing of your Personal Data does not otherwise comply with the GDPR, you have right to contact us and ask us to erase such Personal Data as described above. You can simply write us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com). Please be aware that erasing some Personal Data inserted by you may affect your possibility to utilize the App and its features. Erasure of some Personal Data may also take some time due to technical reasons.

d.  **Right to object processing of your Personal Data.** You can object processing your Personal Data and stop us from processing your Personal data, simply write us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com). Please be aware that erasing some Personal Data inserted by you may affect your possibility to use the App and its features.

e.  **Notice about automated decision-making.** We use automated decision-making tools (e.g. neural networks) that process your Personal Data in order to provide you proper Services (for example, predictions of your cycle). Normally, such automated decision-making works more precisely, if you insert more Personal Data about your cycle, symptoms, physical activities that our neural networks can work with. Our neural networks process this information in order to track particular dependencies and correlations in your cycles and symptoms and provide you more personalized information about your cycle and its predictions.

f. **  Notification requirements.** We commit to notify you within reasonable period of time and your data protection authority within the timeframe specified in applicable law (72 hours) about any personal data breaches in the App.

g.  **Data Protection Authorities.** Subject to GDPR, you also have the right to (i) restrict our use of Personal Data and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority about any of our activities that you deem are not compliant with GDPR.

Please keep in mind that in case of a vague access, erasure, objection request or any other request in exercise of the mentioned rights we may engage the individual in a dialogue so as to better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. In case this is impossible, we reserve the right to refuse granting your request.

Following the provisions of GDPR we might also require you to prove your identity (for example, by requesting an ID or any other proof of identity) in order for you to invoke the mentioned rights, specifically if you exercise them in respect to special categories of Personal Data like data about health. This is made to ensure that no rights of third parties are violated by your request, and the rights described in this section are exercised by an actual Personal Data subject or an authorized person.

Please note that we will grant your request within 30 days after receiving it, but it may take us up to 90 days in some cases, for example for full erasure of your Personal Data stored in our backup systems – this is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data.

## 4\. Sharing your personal data and information

а. **Personal Data**  we share with third parties. We will not share your Personal Data with any third parties except as specified by this Section of the Privacy Policy.

Provided we receive your consent as appropriate under applicable law, we may share some of your Personal Data with AppsFlyer, a mobile marketing platform. By using AppsFlyer and its integrated partners we are able to reach more people like you and spread the word about the App to help more women to stay in control with their health and wellbeing.

Read more about AppsFlyer [here](https://www.appsflyer.com/we-are-appsflyer/) and its integrated partners [here](https://www.appsflyer.com/partners/). 

To accomplish the above-mentioned goal, we may share certain Personal data with AppsFlyer and some of its integrated partners as indicated below.

Here is a step-by-step illustration of how we utilize AppsFlyer and its integrated partners:

1\. You become a Flo user and opt-in for sharing Personal data, strictly limited to the following set: 

a)  Technical identifiers: IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (Identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices), Google Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique technical identifiers.  
b) Your age group;  
c) Your subscription status;  
d) The fact of application launch.

2\. Flo App sends your data to AppsFlyer, which analyzes it and provides us reports and insights on how to optimize our promotional campaigns.  
3. At the same time, AppsFlyer sends your data to some of its integrated partners (e.g. Pinterest, Google Ads, Apple Search Ads, FB marketing network, and a couple of others) to find people like you on different platforms, including social media websites. These integrated partners analyze your data (so-called “custom audience”) and show relevant information about the App to people who might be potentially interested in it (so-called “lookalike audience”).  
4. This is how you contribute to the growth of Flo community. The more people find out about Flo, the more of them get accurate cycle predictions, learn about the meaning of their bodies’ signals and receive credible information about their health. It all happens thanks to you and your consent to use Flo app. 

All third-party services regulated by this Section 4 (a) of the Privacy Policy are either EU-based or compliant with the GDPR (for example, EU-US Privacy Shield Framework that ensures that the European data protection requirement is met).

**PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEVER SHARE YOUR EXACT AGE OR ANY DATA RELATED TO YOUR HEALTH WITH ANY THIRD PARTIES.**

**OPT-OUT OPTIONS.**  YOU CAN WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT TO SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION ANYTIME BY USING ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:

1. BY CONTACTING US AT [ **SUPPORT@FLO.HEALTH**](mailto:SUPPORT@FLO.HEALTH?subject=OPT%20OUT);

2\. BY ADJUSTING YOUR DEVICE SETTINGS IN IOS OR ANDROID IN ORDER TO STOP SHARING YOUR IDFA OR ANDROID ADVERTISING ID WITH ANY THIRD PARTIES. IN SUCH CASE NO THIRD PARTY WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY.

3\. BY USING APPSFLYER’S OPT-OUT/FORGET MY DEVICE OPTION [HERE](https://www.appsflyer.com/optout).

**b. Aggregated Information.** We may share aggregated, anonymized or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, including with our partners or research institutions. For example, we may share, including, without limitation, in articles, blog posts and scientific publications, general age demographic information and aggregate statistics about certain activities or symptoms from data collected to help identify patterns across users.

**c. Special Circumstances.** We will not share any of your Personal Data to any third party except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy and in the following circumstances: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal processes, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements); (ii) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of the App, or to protect any user’s security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; (iii) when disclosure is directed or consented to by the user who has input the Personal Data; (iv) in the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, divestiture, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

**d. Information Posted by User.** The App features several community areas and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions which may be moderated by healthcare experts. Our communities are open to [the public/the App community] and should not be considered private.

Any information (including Personal Data) you share in any online community area or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any Personal Data in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.

If you mistakenly post Personal Data in our community areas and would like it removed, you can send us an email as listed below to request that we remove it. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Data, e.g. for technical reasons.

**e. Third party (onward) transfers and Privacy Shield compliance.** In the context of an onward transfer, if you provided us your explicit consent for such transfer, we have responsibility for the processing of Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield (See Section 11 of this Privacy Policy) or generally from the EU and Swiss residents and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We remain liable under the Principles (as defined below) and GDPR if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles and GDPR, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For any onward transfer we commit to execute a formal agreement with any receiving party or processor acting on our behalf.

If we receive Personal Data subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

## 5\. Retention of your personal data

We will retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active or needed to provide you services, and only for as long as it serves purposes of processing identified in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. At any time, you can remove your Personal Data as specified in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.

You should be aware that we may retain certain Personal Data and other information after your account has been terminated in an aggregated, anonymized form. Any posts or comments you submit may remain visible if and after you delete your account. We are not obligated to remove your posts or comments. We reserve the right to use your information in any aggregated data collection after you have terminated your account, however we will ensure that the use of such information will not identify you personally. We will also retain your Personal Data as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

If you remove data from your account, you will no longer see it in the App, but some backups of the data may remain in our archive servers for a reasonable period of time due to technical solutions we use. However, we undertake to delete any such backups within a reasonable period of time.

If you choose to delete the App, deactivate your account, we retain your Personal data for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

## 6\. Personal data you elect to share with third parties

You can direct us to share data from the App with other parties. For example, you can permit us to share data with other health apps and services like Google Fit and Apple HealthKit. Once you direct us to share your data with a third party, that third party will have their own privacy policy and we do not control how the third party uses or handles the information. You can revoke your consent to share information with such a third party at any time in your App account settings.

We take reasonable steps in order to ensure compliance of such third parties with any applicable laws that might govern processing of your Personal Data. For example, for the EU residents’ Personal Data we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties are GDPR compliant and have GDPR compliant privacy policies in place.

## 7\. Security

We take all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect all collected Personal Data from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data that we process and risks associated with special categories of Personal Data we collect (information about health). Among others, we utilize the following information security measures to protect your Personal Data:

а. Pseudominization and tokenization of certain categories of your Personal Data;

b. Encryption of your Personal Data in transit and in rest;

c. Systematic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing;

d. Protection of data integrity;

e. Organizational and legal measures. For example, our employees have different levels of access to your Personal Data and only those in charge of data management get access to your Personal Data and only for limited purposes required for the operation of the App. We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your Personal Data.

f. Conducting periodical data protection impact assessments in order to ensure that the App fully adheres to the principles of ‘privacy by design’, ‘privacy by default’ and others. We also commit to undertake privacy audit in case of Company’s merger or takeover.

  
Please understand that you can help keep your information secure by choosing and protecting your password appropriately, not sharing your password and preventing others from using your mobile device. Please understand that no security system is perfect and, as such, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App, or that your information won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may either post a notice, or attempt to notify you by email and will take reasonable steps to remedy the breach as specified in this Privacy Policy.

We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

## 8\. Children’s privacy

**General age limitation.**  We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The App is not intended for children and we do not intentionally collect information about children under 13 years old. The App does not collect Personal Data from any person the Company actually knows is under the age of 13. If you are aware of anyone under 13 using the App, please contact us at [support@owhealth.com](mailto:support@owhealth.com) and we will take required steps to delete such information and (or) delete her account.

**Age limitation for EU residents.**  Due to requirements of the GDPR you shall be at least 16 years old in order to use the App. To the extent prohibited by applicable law, we do not allow use of the App by the EU residents younger than 16 years old.

## 9\. Third party links

Although the App may contain links to third party websites or services, we are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on those third-party websites or services. Please understand that this Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect from you. Where we have linked to a third-party website or service, you should read the privacy policy stated on that third-party website or service.

## 10\. Email Communications

We may contact you from time to time via email to communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by us and others, and provide news and information that we think will be of interest to you. You can always opt out of receiving emails by unsubscribing via the “Unsubscribe” link contained in the email. Opting-out of these emails will not end transmission of important service-related emails that are necessary to your use of the App. If applicable laws prescribe so, certain exclusions may apply to the residents of some countries regarding an active opt-in for any email communications from us. We may ask such users at the registration screen to provide their consents for any such communications.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to the Company by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to the Company.

## 11\. International personal data transfers. Privacy Shield notice

**General.**  The Company is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. Please be advised that U.S. law and laws of other countries may not offer the same protections as the law of your jurisdiction.

In addition, you agree that information collected through the App may be stored and processed in Canada, where the Company rents servers, or in any other country in which the Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the App, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
