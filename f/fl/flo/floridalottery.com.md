# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Florida Lotteryâ€™s Web site (www.flalottery.com). Your privacy is very important to us. Our policy is to not collect any personal information about you when you visit the www.flalottery.com Web site, unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available to us.

When you visit www.flalottery.com, the Web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed the site. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information.

In addition, information is only gathered regarding the volume and timing of access to the site by collecting information on the date, time and pages that you visited while at the site. This is done so that the content of the site can be improved, and your personal information is not identified. 

If you choose to share personal information, for example, by sending an e-mail to our ASKLOTT account, the information will be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with the state of Florida's archiving policies. However, information will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies, unless required by state or federal law. Please note that Florida's public records law requires that all information received in connection with state business be made available to anyone upon request, unless the information is subject to a specific statutory exemption.

If you have other questions about this privacy policy, or have suggestions on how it may be improved, please feel free to e-mail us at [asklott@flalottery.com](mailto:asklott@flalottery.com) or contact us by telephone at (850) 487-7787.
