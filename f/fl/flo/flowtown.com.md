We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations).

  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of [Terms of Service](http://flowtown.com/terms.html), or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if Flowtown is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Flowtown will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
