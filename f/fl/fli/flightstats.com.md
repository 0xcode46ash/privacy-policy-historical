# Track Flight Status, Airport Delays and other Flight and Airport Information

Conducive Technology Corp. (Conducive) respects your individual privacy. This privacy policy documents our adherence to the highest industry standards for the protection of your personal information. This policy applies to all Conducive web sites and covers the following areas: 

  * What personally identifiable information is collected by Conducive or by any third party through our web sites.
  * How Conducive uses this information.
  * With whom Conducive may share subscriber information.
  * What choices are available you as a subscriber with respect to collection, use and distribution of the information.
  * What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.
  * How subscribers can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



Conducive may collect information from you at two different stages. First, we may collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to our sites. This type of information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our sites. 

Second, we may require the submission of certain personally identifiable information when you subscribe to use Conducive's services. 

  * For subscribers, registration may require that you submit (or all) of the following personal information: name, company name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, fax number, username and password, and billing information.
  * If your travel agency or airline has contracted with Conducive to provide you with Conducive's flight alerts messaging service, their representatives may be authorized to view the contact information you (or they) have provided to Conducive, in order to assist you with flight-related problems.



Registered users of Conducive services must be at least 18 years of age. Conducive services are not directed to children and Conducive does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. 

Conducive will use your personal information solely for internal purposes incident to the provision of services. We will never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party, except those who require the information in order to provide support for the internal operations of our sites and who do not disclose or use that information for any other purpose. We will never give or sell your personal information to any third party to be used for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers (such as spam). We will not ourselves use your personal information to send you any unsolicited commercial offers or other purposes without first asking for your permission and offering you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those commercial offers or other purposes. 

On rare occasions it is necessary for us to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send subscribers an email. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 

We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our subscribers. A profile is stored information detailing how individual subscribers use our sites. Collected information in a profile is tied to the subscriber's personally identifiable information. However, your profile is used solely for internal purposes, to help us improve the experience of our subscribers and for accounting/billing purposes. We do not share your profile with any third parties. 

Cookies and web beacons are small text files stored on the subscriber's hard drive for an extended period of time. These can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Allowing the Conducive cookie and/or web beacon to remain on your computer makes it easier for you to log in to and use the site. If you reject these files, you may still use the site, but you will be required to provide detailed login information and you may experience some issues with site performance. 

Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track a subscriber's movement and usage in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files record each transaction for purposes of capacity planning and billing and are linked to personally identifiable information. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site(s). 

The third-party advertising companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to our web sites and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices for not having this information used by these companies, the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://networkadvertising.org/) Â  web site offers information about Internet advertising companies and their web practices. Their web site also provides the capability to "opt-out" of information collection by their member companies. 

Conducive does not provide any personally identifiable customer information to advertisers or to third-party web sites. 

Though we make every effort to preserve subscriber privacy, we will disclose personal information when required by law, if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us. 

In the event Conducive goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, our subscribers' personal information may be part of the assets transferred. If, as a result of the business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given a choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section 

This website contains links to other sites. Conducive is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Conducive. 

Conducive takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect our subscribers' information. However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

When our subscription form asks you to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as the subscription form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer appears locked. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on line, we also make an effort to protect subscriber information off-line. All of our subscribers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at Conducive, you can send an email to privacy@conducivetech.com. 

If your personally identifiable information changes or you decide to cancel your subscription, you may correct, update, or deactivate our record of your personally identifiable information by logging in and editing your account. To request that your personal information should no longer be used by Conducive, simply send an email to: privacy@conducivetech.com. 

Conducive is a participant in the Safe Harbor program which was developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. In compliance with the "Enforcement" principle of the Safe Harbor program, Conducive utilizes an internal self-assessment verification process which satisfies the Safe Harbor requirements. If you have concerns about the privacy of your personal information based on the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, send an email to: privacy@conducivetech.com. A Conducive representative will contact you and take steps to address your concerns. 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post a notice on the main page and other pages to alert you about the change. If the privacy policy changes materially so that we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email and give you a choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this different manner. 

However, if you have opted out of all communication with the site, or deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted and your personal information will not be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect registered user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web sites notifying subscribers of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email registered users notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
