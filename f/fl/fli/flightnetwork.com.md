# Privacy Policy | Flight Network

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your personal information on our website, how we protect such information, and the choices you have concerning the use and disclosure of such information. Your privacy is important to FlightNetwork®. Please read the Policy below carefully.

At FlightNetwork®, providing a private and secure purchase environment is one of our top priorities. We want you to be as comfortable and at ease as possible when visiting our website. We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of those users who visit and browse our website.

Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by our website. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information you reveal or choose to post in any public forum or for the privacy practices of websites that are operated or owned by third parties.

**Purchase Policy**  
While we are confident that transactions on our site are secure, we recognize that you may have concerns about purchasing travel online. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology ([SSL](http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html)). Only those employees or agents who need to access your personal information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. All employees and/or agents must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept updated on our security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however, therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

At FlightNetwork® you always have the option of calling one of our travel experts to complete your purchase.
