# FlipKey Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy.

TRUST. We understand that making purchases and travel plans online involves a great deal of trust on your part and we respect your privacy. We take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Please read the following policy to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting our U.S. website, www.flipkey.com, you are accepting the practices described herein.

What Personal Information We Collect

In General. We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request information about your traveler preferences. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.

Information from Other Sources.  FlipKey does not currently use independent third-party sources to add to our user account information or delivery and address information.

Automatic Information. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit FlipKey.com. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as properties viewed, reservations sent, and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience.

Cookies and Other Web Technologies. When you visit FlipKey.com, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). For example, whenever you sign in as an FlipKey.com member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from FlipKey.com, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools we offer.

Information Collected by Third-Party Advertising Companies. Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons or single-pixel GIFS) for several purposes, including: to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on FlipKey.com and other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

How We Use Your Personal Information

FlipKey _does not_ sell user information, including name, email address, contact information, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information, to third-parties. FlipKey uses information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Web site; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with FlipKey.com; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Pages/terms_cond/); and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.

FlipKey.com may share your information with the following entities:

Suppliers, such as vacation rental managers, rental owners, hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout FlipKey.com, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you have made on FlipKey.com, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through FlipKey.com. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or to facilitate your travel reservation.

Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners and recommend you evaluate their practices before deciding to provide your personal information.

Sharing this information with our U.S. corporate affiliates, enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial e-mail they send to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.

We also may share your information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law; (ii) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of FlipKey.com, our customers, or others; and in connection with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Pages/terms_cond/) and other agreements; and (iii) in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors a Web site receives or what are the most popular vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.

How We Protect Your Personal Information

We want you to feel confident about using FlipKey.com to plan your vacation rental and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect.

In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

Children's Privacy
