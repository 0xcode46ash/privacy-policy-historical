Information that FLIR Collects  
FLIR collects information from all users of the FLIR Site, except as described below. What information we collect and how we use it, depends upon your activity on the FLIR Site. 

Children’s Privacy Policy  
FLIR does not knowingly collect the personally identifiable information of children under the age of thirteen. Because FLIR is committed to protecting children’s privacy online, use of the FLIR Site by children under the age of thirteen who live in the United States is prohibited. 

Visiting  
FLIR collects non-personally identifiable, anonymous information from all visitors to the FLIR Site. Examples of the types of anonymous information that FLIR collects include a user’s IP address, browser type, and the date and time a user accessed the FLIR Site. We use this anonymous information for system administration purposes in order to enhance the operation of the FLIR Site and make it more useful to visitors. We may share this information with outside parties, but each user’s personal identity remains anonymous. 

From time to time, we may use an outside agent to collect anonymous user information. The collection and use of such information will be for purposes substantially identical to those described above. As part of this service, the outside agent may use cookies. 

Registration To use certain features of the FLIR Site, you must first complete a registration procedure which requires you to provide certain personal information, such as the your name and email address (providing demographic information, such as your job title, is optional). FLIR collects this information and uses it internally for purposes such as marketing, customer administration, technical administration of the FLIR Site, or to contact you. FLIR does not share this information with outside parties except as indicated in the ‘Information Sharing’ section below. 

Community Forum You may submit personal information to FLIR by using the Community Forum feature of the FLIR Site. Information that you submit in this manner will be subject to the terms contained in our Terms of Use Agreement. To review these terms click here . 

Other Information FLIR may, from time to time, collect other information from you (for instance, when we make special offers, hold promotions, or conduct surveys). Information collected by these means is used internally for purposes such as marketing, customer administration, technical administration of the FLIR Site, or to contact you. FLIR does not share this information with outside parties except as indicated in the ‘Information Sharing’ section below. 

Cookies FLIR uses cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data placed on your computer's hard drive by FLIR that can transmit your information to us. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie terminates automatically after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive, but can be removed by following the directions on your browser. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but this may prevent you from enjoying all of the features of the FLIR Site. 

We use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests, to streamline the login process, and to collect anonymous user data in the aggregate. The cookies make your use of the FLIR Site easier, allow you to retrieve an earlier shopping cart, make the FLIR Site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain the security of the FLIR Site. 

Some outside parties may use cookies on the FLIR Site (for example, banner advertisers). FLIR has no access to or control over these cookies. 

Information Sharing. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement, FLIR does not disclose your personally identifiable information to outside parties. 

FLIR may partner with other outside parties to provide specific services. When a user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. FLIR uses great care in selecting business partners with whom we share your information. However, FLIR is not a guarantor of outside parties’ practices regarding your information. Users of the FLIR Site permit the sharing of their personal information at their own risk, and shall not hold FLIR responsible for acts or omissions of outside parties. 

FLIR will disclose your information when we believe in good faith that it is legally required, such as pursuant to a warrant, subpoena, or court order, or to protect our rights and property. 

In the event that FLIR is acquired by or merged into another company, all information collected will be transferred to the acquiring company as one of FLIR's assets and will be governed by the acquiring company's privacy policy, if any. 

Security FLIR takes precautions to protect our users’ information both online and offline.   
We also protect user information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a user service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
