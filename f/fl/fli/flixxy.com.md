The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information.

Cookies may be used to maintain session information, although their use is not required.

"Cookies" are data sent to your web browser from a web server that can uniquely identify your computer and store information about user preferences. Most web browsers will accept cookies by default, but they can be set to reject cookies, either from all websites or from specific sites. You can also manually delete cookies from your web browser. These options are generally set through a "Privacy" setting in your browser setup. 

Third parties may be placing and reading cookies or using web beacons to collect information, in the course of ads being served on the website. You can determine whether or not to accept cookies and their expiration date using the "Privacy" setting in your browser. 

Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site. Web beacons are typically used by a third-party to monitor the activity of a site. Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded. 

**   
"No-Spam" Policy**

Flixxy.com maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. If you contact us by e-mail, your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party.
