# Data Privacy → FlixBus

## Data Privacy Statement and Consent for Data Usage

We appreciate Your interest in our website. Protecting Your privacy and the handling Your personal information is very important for us. Therefore, the Data Privacy Policy of FlixBus has high priority. During collection, processing and usage we strictly comply with the legal provisions of the Data Protection Act and the Telemedia Act.  
By agreeing to the following data privacy policy, You provide consent to the FlixBus GmbH in the collection, processing and use in accordance with the data protection laws and the provisions below. The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.

## Collection, Processing and Use of Personal Data

The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. To handle the ticket order and the payment processing for it as well as for signing up for our newsletter, we collect, store and process Your data.  For the payment of a booked trip by credit card FlixBus requires Your full name, e-mail address and Your credit card. The credit card number will not be stored. When paying a booked trip via direct debiting, FlixBus records Your full name, address, date of birth, e-mail address and Your checking account data.  If payment is made by instant bank transfer and Paypal no payment data is stored.

The data required for the contract and for the implementation of the bus rides are passed on to the performing bus companies and other third parties (e.g. payment service) as part of the registration and processing of ticket sales. In justified cases (e.g. damages to the buses) we reserve the right to pass on the customer data to the transporting bus partner.  Such disclosure may be used by our service providers exclusively for the fulfillment of their task and not for other purposes.

FlixBus will not share personal data for marketing purposes to third parties.
