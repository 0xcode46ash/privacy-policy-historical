How To Contact Us

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on Flightlevel350.com. We collect some personal information about the author of the videos in our site. This information is limited to your name, email and IP address at the time you send a media file to us. Other information such as your phone number and address is not collected. 

If you decide to post a message in one of our forums or on the video comments section, again, the only information collected is your name, email (if provided) and IP address at the time of submission. 

**The Way We Use Information:**

We do not share this information with outside parties. When you send us a video, the visitors to the site will be able to contact you using a contact form. However, your email address will not be revealed to them. If you don't want anyone to find out your email simply don't respond to these messages. If you do not wish to receive emails from our visitors let us know using the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214121251id_/http%3A//www.flightlevel350.com/contact.php). We will never send you spam or unsolicited emails. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**How You Can Correct Your Information**

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
