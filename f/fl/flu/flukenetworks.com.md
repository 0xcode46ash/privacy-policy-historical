**Fluke Networks' Email Subscription Program **

Fluke Networks offers email delivery of timely and relevant information about our products, promotions, events and technical resources to those who request it. Users opt-in or subscribe to receive these communications by selecting the content categories and areas of interest you wish to receive regularly from Fluke Networks. We do not rent, sell or exchange email addresses.  


**Contact Frequency**  
Your positive experience with our email subscription program is our priority. Therefore, in addition to sending you only the types of communications you have opted-in to receive, we also regulate the number of times we will email you within these designated preferences. You will be emailed no more than THREE times per monthly calendar. This means that you may receive three email communications relevant to your subscription interests during a calendar month. 

There are the following exceptions to this rule in order that Fluke Networks meets its legal, contractual, financial and safety obligations to our customers: 

  * Gold SuperVision Support notices as required by the customer's Gold program agreement including product updates, upgrades and "members only" promotions 
  * Product upgrades or bug fixes to registered product owners 
  * Product safety notices to the product users 
  * Email confirmations of contest entries/winners as noted in contest rules 
  * Email communications from retail sales organizations who carry Fluke Networks equipment. Note: Fluke Networks does not distribute user contact information so any direct contact with third party organizations fall outside of our email subscription program and policies. 
  * One-on-one correspondence with Fluke Networks' employees  


**How Fluke Networks' Email Subscription Program works**  
You can opt-in to receive email updates when you register on [MyVision](https://myvision.flukenetworks.com/accounts/subscribe.asp). Upon completion of registration and receipt of permission from the user to receive the specified types of email communications, Fluke Networks will communicate to you only those communications preferences positively indicated on the MyVision registration form. 

**Subscription Pre-selections**  
Existing Eye On Networks subscribers will continue to receive the e-newsletter in its new technical-only format unless you opt-out by deselecting the field provided. These subscribers are also pre-selected to receive separate email communications on the content previously delivered in Eye On Networks, namely New Product Announcements, Promotions and Events. New MyVision users are pre-selected to receive just our technical e-newsletter Eye On Networks until you change your preferences.   


**Opting out of Email Subscription Program**  
To opt-out of receiving all or part of the email communications that you have expressly requested do one of the following:

  * From an email you receive from Fluke Networks: 
    * Click on the Unsubscribe link and you will be unsubscribed from all future email communications in our program.
