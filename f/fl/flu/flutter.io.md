# Privacy Promise - Flutter | Gesture Recognition on Your Webcam

### We absolutely believe that our users are the sole reason behind our success and your trust is the most precious thing we have. We think of everyone who uses and touches Flutter as a member of the Flutter family. Flutter Privacy Promise is carefully crafted with the understanding that we always protect our family!

Flutter integrates with the webcam in your computer and uses it to recognize your gestures. We know that while the webcam is turned 'on', you may be engaged in a personal activity, so we focused on building an application that recognizes gestures 

_locally_ on your machine without sending video to a server. This means all captured frames stay within the confines of your personal computer. 

With family one builds trust and interdependence, rather than establishing a privacy policy, Flutter makes the following promises to you:

## Flutter Promises:

  * You and your needs will always come first.
