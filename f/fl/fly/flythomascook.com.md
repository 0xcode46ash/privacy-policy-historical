## Use of personal details

We will retain the personal information you have given us (directly or via your travel agent) in connection with your booking and also provide this to your airline and service provider, as applicable. You should note that the airline/service provider may be located outside of the UK/EU in a country which does not provide the same level of data protection as in the UK. We will also retain the personal information you give us when you request or agree to updates or further information from our website. In some cases we may need to process sensitive personal information relating to you. For example if you make a special request relating to any special dietary, religious or disability related requirements you may have, we may need to disclose this data to the airline/service provider in order that the flight/service can be provided. By providing us with this information, we are entitled to assume that you are happy for us to disclose your details in this way if required. If you do not provide us with this information or do not wish us to disclose it to the airline/service provider then we regret we cannot arrange for your request to be provided and/or may be unable to sell travel insurance to you, if applicable.

We would also like to store and use your personal details for future marketing purposes (for example, sending you a brochure or details of a promotion including by e-mail). We shall assume that you are happy for us to do so unless you tell us otherwise. 

Occasionally we contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, for example mailing information to our customers. We only provide those companies with the personal details relating to our customers which they require in order to deliver the service. They are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. We will ensure that anyone to whom we pass your details for this reason agrees to treat it with the same level of protection we are obliged to provide.

You are entitled to ask for a copy of your personal details which we hold, for your information (for which we may charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies.
