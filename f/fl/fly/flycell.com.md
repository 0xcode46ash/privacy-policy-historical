# Ringtones, Cell Phone Wallpapers, Mobile Phone Games and more - Flycell - Privacy Policy

We at FLYCELL USA, Inc. know how much you value your privacy, so we make sure that your privacy is protected any time you're using our services. You do need to give us some personal information so we're able to process your orders and requests. However, we want you to know what information we need, why we need it, and how we make sure that your information is protected. We want you to be able to enjoy your FLYCELL experience safely and privately.

  
When you sign up with FLYCELL, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering ringtones, graphics, games and other items and services. 

  
In order to establish your private FLYCELL account and/or place an order, we need some personal information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, email, cell phone number and address) and certain billing information, like a new cell phone number or change of carrier. 

We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the FLYCELL service.

  
To update your personal information, simply sign in and go to _My Account_ from your personal home page. You may also contact our Support team by writing [help@flycell.com](mailto:help@flycell.com). You can make changes to your account information at any time.

  
Flycell uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. When any personal information is requested on the site we use SSL to present secure pages to protect that it.

You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft Web sites. Beta versions of browsers are not recommended.

  
We will notify you about new features and services on FLYCELL ONLY if you request to receive this information when you register as a new user. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to this notification service through your account profile on the Flycell website.

We may send you site and service announcement updates with important information about the service. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements.

This information may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another's rights or property.

  
If our privacy policy changes, those changes will be posted to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are aware of the policy and applicable changes. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will e-mail our users announcing the new privacy policy.
