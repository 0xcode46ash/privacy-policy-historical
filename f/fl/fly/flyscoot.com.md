# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the Scoot™ website, [www.flyscoot.com](http://www.flyscoot.com/en/). This section explains how Scoot™ protects the privacy of any personal information you provide to us during the course of your online experience.

Your privacy is very important to Scoot™. Therefore, we have developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we handle the information you may provide us with when you visit our website.

This Privacy Policy is divided into two parts:

  * Part A: General customer data privacy policy statement
  * Part B: Privacy policy statement for customer data collected through Scoot™’s websites, social media assets and Scoot™’s mobile services facility



### Part A: General Customer Data Privacy Policy Statement

##### 1\. Types of Customer Data

We will collect 2 broad categories of customer data, depending on the nature and circumstances of the service requested or transaction undertaken:

  * Personal Data, which includes but is not limited to:


  1. Personal information that links back to an individual e.g., name, gender, date of birth, passport or other personal identification numbers;
  2. Contact information e.g., address, phone number, email address;
  3. Payment information e.g., credit or debit card information, including the name of cardholder, card number, billing address and expiry date;
  4. Travel information e.g., flight information, dietary and seating or other service preferences;
  5. Health information e.g., medical records or requests;
  6. Technical information e.g., IP address; and


  * Statistical Data, which is information on the behaviour of visitors to our website (see Section 2 of Part B).



This is collected for analytical purposes, to better understand the profile of our customers. This information will not be stored on your customer record, and is entirely anonymous, necessary to enforce legal regulations, or necessary to investigate suspected unlawful activity.

For purposes of this policy statement, the phrase Customer Data includes Personal Data and Statistical Data.

The provision of Customer Data (save for where the request for data is marked “optional” in the forms used to collect personal data) is obligatory in order for Scoot™ to carry out its services to you

The failure to supply such Customer Data may result in

  1. Scoot™ being unable to provide you with the services and/or products requested;
  2. Scoot™ being unable to update you on our latest products and/or launches; and/or
  3. your inability to enter or participate in contests, promotions or redemption activities organised by Scoot™’s websites, social media assets and mobile services facility.



##### 2\. Purposes for Collection, Use and Disclosure

Generally, Scoot™ collects Customer Data, either directly from you or from your authorised representatives (i.e. persons whom you have authorised, persons who have been validly identified as being you or your authorised representative pursuant to our then-current security procedures), from third parties (e.g., your travel agent or our service provider), or from publicly available sources, through our website, social media assets, mobile services, and other channels including our ticketing counters and airport operations, in order to fulfil the following purposes, which include but are not limited to:

  * Providing services to you such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a booking), providing technical assistance, assisting you in the transaction, providing flight alert messages through Scoot™’s mobile services facility and facilitating internet check-in;
  * Marketing and communicating with you in relation to products and services offered by Scoot™ and its airline and service partners;
  * Contacting you for product or customer satisfaction surveys and market research; and
  * Compliance with standard safety, security and legal requirements.



In connection with the above, we may disclose, transfer and jointly use your Customer Data to and with our parent and affiliated airlines. In addition, we may disclose your Customer Data to third parties, such as our travel and freight service providers or travel-related businesses, partner airlines, airport management, security personnel and other carriers , but only to the extent that it is directly related to the primary purpose of its collection.

##### 3\. Processing and Disclosure of Customer Data

We may process and disclose your personal information with third parties, such as our travel and freight service providers, or travel-related businesses, partner airlines, airport management, security personnel and other carriers for the purpose of processing your travel arrangements. Please rest assured that in all such instances, we will ensure that they adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and will prohibit them from using your personal information in any way other than the specific purpose for which we supply it. We may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies and governments for security, customs and immigration purposes. Please note that the initial recipients of such information may share booking data with other government agencies or enforcement authorities.

Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless it is either authorised or required by law, necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, reasonably necessary to enforce legal regulations, or necessary to investigate suspected unlawful activity.

##### 4\. Transfer of Information Overseas

Our head office is based in Singapore. We may thus transfer your personal information to overseas data storage facilities where we keep our central records, our offices or appointed agents. Such transfers are necessary for us to fulfil our contract with you, as well as with relevant third parties, where applicable.

##### 5\. Consent to Provide Information

Whenever there is a need for us to perform a service for you that requires your personal information, your consent in providing such data will be implied from your request of the service or transaction to be completed. However, where required by law, Scoot™ will adopt an ‘opt-in' policy for obtaining customer consent, in which event, express written consent will be sought from you when collecting your Customer Data e.g., signing a form or checking a box. However, if you elect not to provide such consent, we may not be able to provide the service you have requested in which case we will advise you immediately so you can make an informed decision. Where you make reservations on behalf of another person, you undertake and will ensure that the individual whose Customer Data is supplied to Scoot™ has authorized the disclosure, is informed of and consents to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You may submit a request to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting Scoot™ (see Section 10).

Statistical Data is not linked to a customer record and Scoot™ does not need to seek consent for the collection, use or disclosure of Statistical Data. For more information on the collection and usage of Customer Data obtained from Scoot™’s websites, social media assets and through Scoot™’s services facility, please refer to Part B.

##### 6\. Access to your Information

We will, on request, allow you to access your personal information stored with us. However, we may charge an administrative fee to help us recover the costs incurred to supply such information to you. In exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to comply with your request, but will provide you with the explanation for refusal, where applicable. Exceptional circumstances include where:

  * An investigating authority or government institution objects to Scoot™ complying with a customer’s request,
  * The information may, in the exercise of Scoot™’s reasonable discretion and/or assessment, affect the life or security of an individual, and
  * Data is collected in connection with an investigation of a breach of contract, suspicion of fraudulent activities or contravention of law.



##### 7\. Retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by applicable law. If your personal information is no longer required, we will take reasonable steps to ensure any information that we hold will be destroyed or de-identified where required by applicable law.

We hold your personal information in hard copy and electronic files. We may also use third party information system providers to store or have access to your personal information.

##### 8\. Accuracy

We will need your assistance to ensure that the personal information you provide to us is current, complete and accurate. If there are errors or changes to be made, please contact us and we will work towards either correcting it or discuss alternative actions with you.

Scoot™ may also request Personal Data updates from you from time to time. As detailed in Section 2 above under the “Purposes for Collection, Use and Disclosure” sub-section, your booking information or flight itinerary may be disclosed to the appropriate customs and immigration authorities as required by law. As such, it is important to ensure that the Personal Data contained in your booking information or flight itinerary is current, complete and accurate.

##### 9\. Updates to the Privacy Policy

We may amend this Privacy Policy if and when the business or legal requirements change. The updated versions will always be posted on our website with a date stamp, so that you are aware of when the last update was made. Subject to applicable laws, the prevailing language of the Privacy Policy will be English. In the event of any inconsistency in understanding between the English version and any translated version, the English version will prevail.

##### 10\. Contact Us

Scoot™ has appointed a Data Protection Officer, who will respond to any requests or concerns from you regarding this Privacy Statement, what personal data is held by us and how it has been used.
