This Privacy Policy applies to the ScootTM website, www.flyscoot.com, and explains how we protect the privacy of any personal information you provide to us during the course of your online experience.

Your privacy is important to ScootTM. Which is why we have developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we handle the information you may provide us with when you visit our website.

This Privacy Policy is divided into two parts: 

  * Part A: General customer data privacy policy statement
  * Part B: Privacy policy statement for customer data collected through our website


  1. #### Types of Customer Data

We will collect 2 broad categories of customer data, depending on the nature and circumstances of the service requested or transaction undertaken:

    * Customer data, which is personal information that links back to an individual e.g.: name, address and email address
    * Statistical Data, which is information on the behaviour of visitors to our website (see Section 2 of Part B). This is collected for analytical purposes, to better understand the profile of our customers. This information will not be stored on your customer record, and is entirely anonymous.essary to enforce legal regulations, or necessary to investigate suspected unlawful activity.
  2. #### Purpose for collection, processing and disclosure

**Collection**

We currently collect customer data for the following purposes:

    * Sharing of our news and latest developments in the products and services we offer, as well as those offered by our partners
    * Compliance with standard safety, security and legal requirements

**Processing and disclosure of customer data**

We may process and disclose your personal information with third parties, such as our travel and freight service providers, or travel-related businesses, partner airlines, airport management, security personnel and other carriers for the purpose of processing your travel arrangements.

Please rest assured that in all such instances, we will ensure that they adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and will prohibit them from using your personal information in any way other than the specific purpose for which we supply it. 

We may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies and governments for security, customs and immigration purposes. Please note that the initial recipients of such information may share booking data with other government agencies or enforcement authorities.

Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless it is either authorised or required by law, necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, reasonably necessary to enforce legal regulations, or necessary to investigate suspected unlawful activity.

#### Transfer of information overseas

Our head office is based in Singapore. We may thus transfer your personal information to overseas data storage facilities where we keep our central records, our offices or appointed agents. Such transfers are necessary for us to fulfil our contract with you, as well as with relevant third parties, where applicable.

  3. #### Consent to provide information

Whenever there is a need for us to perform a service for you that requires your personal information, your consent in providing such data will be implied from your request of the service or transaction to be completed.

However, where required by law, we will require you to agree to the collection of your personal information, expressed in written consent e.g.: signing a form or checking a box.

  4. #### Access to your information

We will, on request, allow you to access your personal information stored with us. However, we may charge an administrative fee to help us recover the costs incurred to supply such information to you. In exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to comply with your request, but will provide you with the explanation for refusal, where applicable.

  5. #### Retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by relevant laws.

  6. #### Accuracy

We will need your assistance to ensure that the personal information you provide to us is current, complete and accurate. If there are errors or changes to be made, please contact us and we will work towards either correcting it or discuss alternative actions with you. 

  7. #### Updates to the privacy policy

We may amend this Privacy Policy if and when the business or legal requirements change. The updated versions will always be posted on our website with a date stamp, so that you are aware of when the last update was made. Subject to applicable laws, the prevailing language of the Privacy Policy will be English. In the event of any inconsistency in understanding between the English version and any translated version, the English version will prevail.
