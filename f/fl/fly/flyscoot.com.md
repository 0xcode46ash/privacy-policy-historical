# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Statement is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of the information that you submit to us and that we collect from you through our website.

Scoot ('Scoot', 'We', 'Us', 'Our') collects Personal Data about You when a booking is made with Us (whether by You on or Your behalf), when You visit Our website [www.flyscoot.com](https://web.archive.org/en/), when You call Us, or when You deal with Us directly, for example at airport counters. We may also collect PD from job applicants. 

#### Personal Data (PD)

PD is any data whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified —

  * from that data; or
  * from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.



### PD We Collect

Scoot collects PD about You in order better to provide You with personal services such as air travel and associated products such as travel insurance and accommodation, as well as to market Our products and services. Scoot may also collect PD to comply with applicable laws, including requirements relating to air travel, immigration, customs and security.

The types of PD that Scoot collects about You includes: 

  * Personal information that links back to the individual including name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, passport details and nationality; 
  * Contact information e.g., address, phone number, email address; 
  * Payment information e.g., credit card or debit card information, including the name of the cardholder, card number, billing address and expiry date;
  * Travel information e.g., flight information, dietary and seating or other service preferences; 
  * Health information e.g., medical records or requests; 
  * Technical information e.g., IP address; 



Scoot will only collect PD that We reasonably require in the course of providing You with services or that We are required or permitted by law to collect. We will only collect by lawful and fair means in accordance with this Privacy Statement and relevant legislation.

For those data processing activities which require your consent, you may withdraw such consent at any time; however, please note that We may no longer be able to provide You with certain services.

You may interact with Us anonymously or using a pseudonym only for very limited purposes, such as calling Our call centre to make an inquiry or contacting Our Data Protection Officer. We will not be able to provide You any travel services or related purchases if You choose to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym because We are required by law to provide Your PD to Customs, Immigration and security officials at the time of travel.

### How We Use PD

We will use Your PD for the following purposes, amongst others:

  * Processing, and collecting payment for the flight booking for You and any companions;
  * Being aware of any special travel requirements (health or otherwise) You or Your travelling companion may have;
  * Providing You with confirmation of Your flight booking and advising You of any changes to Your itinerary;
  * Improving the flight booking process, including collecting preferences indicated by You when signing up for Our Scoot Account Subscriptions;
  * Confirming Your identity when You check in;
  * Processing and provision of Your purchase of in-flight services such as video, entertainment, food and beverages, and any other services which best meet Your preferences and needs (which We may collect during Our interactions with You);

  * Assisting Customs and Immigration officials;
  * Answering any queries You may have, providing technical assistance, assisting in and administering the flight booking transaction, providing flight alert messages through Our mobile services facility, facilitating internet check-in;

This includes collecting data relating to Your use of Our website to offer You personalized electronic content and electronic marketing material pertaining to Our, and Our airline and service partners’, as well as Our appointed agents’, products and services; and
  * Safety, security and legal compliance.



### How We Disclose PD

**_Sharing with affiliates and service partners_**

In connection with the above, We may, from time to time, collect, disclose, transfer and jointly use Your PD to and with Our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliated airlines. In addition, We may disclose Your PD to third parties, such as Our travel and freight service providers or travel-related businesses and service providers, partner airlines, airport management, security personnel and other carriers.

If You also subscribe to Our mailing list, We may email to You updates about Our products and services.

**_Fulfilling Orders and Maintaining Systems_**

When you purchase a product or a service from Us or through our Website, we may share certain PD, such as your shipping address and billing address, with third party fulfillment companies, in order to deliver the product or service to you. We may also share your PD with third-party service providers that provide advertising and marketing services for us, including distribution of postal mail, electronic alerts, email and mobile text messages to our customers and potential customers. We require these third-party service providers to refrain from using your PD, except to provide the services requested by us. We also hire vendors that work on our systems that may have access to Your PD in the course of performing their duties. We require those vendors to keep your PD confidential and not to use it for their own purposes. You expressly consent to the sharing of your PD with our third-party service providers and vendors.

**_Compliance with Laws and Protection of Rights_**

Regardless of any choices you make regarding Your PD, we may disclose your PD if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with laws or regulations, court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process; or (b) protect and defend Our rights or property, or the rights or safety of third parties, or to enforce our Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice.

**_Purpose of Collection or Use of PD_**

If We use or disclose Your PD for a purpose (the 'secondary purpose') other the main reason for which it was originally collected (the 'primary purpose'), to the extent required by law We will ensure that: 

  * The secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and You would reasonably expect that We would use or disclose Your PD in that way; or
  * You have consented to the use or disclosure of Your PD for the secondary purpose; or
  * The use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under applicable law; or
  * The use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by law (for example, as a necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).

If We are made aware that We received unsolicited PD that We could not have collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable legislation, such PD will be destroyed or de-identified as soon as practicable, as permitted by applicable law. 

### Employment Applications

If You make an employment application to Us, whether solicited or not, We will collect certain PD about You. The type of PD We may collect includes the information in Your application, such as: name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, career history, education details or other information relating to Your career or professional skills.

In considering Your application, We may also obtain PD about You from third parties, for example, from Your previous employers or nominated references. With your consent, we may also collect sensitive information about You in order to process your application, such as information about Your health (including any disability) or any criminal record that You may have, as permitted by law.

We collect and use PD in connection with employment applications for any one or more of the following purposes: 

  * Assess You for a position or positions with Us or Our related entities;

  * Law enforcement agencies to verify whether You have a criminal record, as permitted by law; or
  * Educational or vocational organisations to the extent necessary to verify Your qualifications.



If We engage third-party contractors to perform services for Us which involves handling personal information We will take reasonable steps to prohibit the contractor from using personal information except for the purposes for which it was supplied. 

#### Location and Duration That PD is Stored

Your PD is stored depending on the type of products or services You have requested from Us. For air travel and related services, Your PD may be stored in Our booking system, Our departure control systems, Our Customer Relations Management System and in Our email database.  
PD collected by Scoot or on Our behalf is held securely in systems in Singapore, Australia, the Philippines and Ireland. We will hold Your PD for as long as required for the purposes for which it was collected or to provide Our services, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. 

#### Security

We implement technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards to prevent access to your PD by unauthorized persons. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although We strive to protect such information and implement reasonable safeguards, We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information You transmit to Us or from Our online products or services and You do so at Your own risk.

#### Transfer of PD To Third Countries

For travel-related purposes, We may transfer Your PD to any of Our flight destinations or the flight destinations of Our airline partners, including points in: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Viet Nam, the Philippines, Australia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar, China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and the United States. We may also transfer PD held by Us or on Our behalf between Singapore, Australia, the Philippines and Ireland, where Our data storage or third-party processing facilities are located. PD collected on Our behalf by Our third-party call-centre contractors is shared only with Us.

You understand and expressly consent to such transfers as being necessary for Us to fulfil Your flight and other arrangements. If You are included in a booking with Us for travel with other persons, You agree that We may share some of Your PD with the other people in connection with Your booking.

#### Booking of Ancillary Services and Links to Third-Party Sites

Our Website may provide a link to another website or Internet location, including third-party sites with Scoot-branded pages (“Third-Party Sites”). For example, when You make a booking for a related travel product, such as a hotel or a rental car, via the Website, We act only as a data intermediary for the organisation that is selling You the product. We provide these links merely for your convenience, and we have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for these Third-Party Sites, their content, or any goods or services available through the Third-Party Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third-Party Sites.   
As a data intermediary, We may collect PD from You when you interact with the Third-Party Sites. This PD will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and in the same manner as if We were collecting it from You for Our purposes. 

#### Access, correction, withdrawal of consent

If You do not wish to remain a subscriber to Our mailing list or otherwise receive updates on Our products and services, You are able to unsubscribe from Our mailing list via Our website, by clicking on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link on an email from Us or by contacting the Data Protection Officer.   
Regardless of recorded opt-out preferences, We reserve the right to send emails or other communications for administrative or transactional purposes, including, but not limited to, communications related to the maintenance of your account. We may also contact You in order to ensure that the PD that We hold about You is correct and up-to-date.   
Subject to applicable laws or regulations, You may request access to Your PD held by Us. You may also ask Us to detail how Your PD has been used in the past twelve months, and You may also require Us to correct or delete Your PD, including Your email address, that We hold. We will respond promptly to all such requests, which should be made to the Data Protection Officer. However, We may charge an administrative fee to help Us recover the costs incurred to supply such information to You. 

In exceptional circumstances, We may not be able to comply with Your request, but We will provide you with the explanation for refusal, where applicable. Exceptional circumstances may include where: 

  * An investigating authority or government institution objects to Scoot complying with a customer’s request,
  * The information may, in the exercise of Scoot’s reasonable discretion and/or assessment, affect the life or security of an individual, and
  * Data is collected in connection with an investigation of a breach of contract, suspicion of fraudulent activities or contravention of law.

Cookies can either be "persistent" or "session" based. Persistent cookies are stored on Your computer and stay on your computer until you delete them. Session cookies are short-lived and are held on Your browser's memory only for the duration of Your session.

##### _Local Shared Objects_

Local shared objects (such as "Flash" cookies) are associated with non-Browser software like Flash Player. Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others, but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls. You can visit adobe.com for guidance on how to delete and block Flash cookies.

##### _HTML5 Local Storage_

HTML5 local storage is another way that browsers can distinguish your device from others as well as remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website. Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage in your particular case. 

##### _Web Beacons_

Web beacons are image files that are used by third-party advertisers, analytics companies, and others. Web beacons are embedded in web pages you visit and cause your browser to share its IP address with the third-party source of the beacon, together with any cookies associated with that third-party. Web beacons can be used with or without cookies. Blocking cookies will not stop your IP address from being shared through the use of beacons.

##### _E-tags_

E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance. E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others. Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case. 

##### _Other Technologies_

Our Website may occasionally use other technologies both for purposes of advertising as well as for features, analytics and services.

#### Advertising and Partnership with Adara and Sojern

We use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. For example, Scoot partners advertising networks, Adara (Adara.com) and Sojern (Sojern.com), to capture non-personally identifiable data from You through third-party cookies. This enables Adara and Sojern to display targeted and relevant messages from selected third-party websites, based on Your viewing behaviour on the Scoot websites and other selected websites. Your non-personally identifiable data is shared by Scoot with Adara and Sojern for the unique purpose of serving more relevant advertising. These third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information. We have no control over the use of cookies by Adara and Sojern. You can opt-out of cookie use as follows:

##### _For Adara_

  * By visiting <http://adara.com/privacy-promise/opt-out> and clicking ‘Submit’; or
  * Through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising, of which Adara is member. Each of these programmes provides an opt-out page where You can exercise control over members/’participants’ cookies from a central location.



##### _For Sojern_

  * By visiting <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?affiliateId=111>, checking the opt-out box and clicking ‘Submit Opt-outs’; or
  * Through the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising, of which Sojern is a member. This programme provides an opt-out page where You can exercise control over members/’participants’ cookies from a central location.



##### _For Other Third Parties_

* To opt-out of NAI members’ or DAA participants’ cookies, visit:

  * NAI: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
  * DAA: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>



As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

##### _Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources_

Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

##### _Do Not Track_

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.

##### _Social Network Widget_

Our website may include social network sharing widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.

### Information from Children Under 13

On our website, we do not intentionally gather Personal Information from visitors under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information about your child, please contact our Data Protection Officer, and we will attempt to delete the information. 

### Your California Privacy Rights

Under Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year.

We will amend this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice, and the updated versions will be posted on Our website and date stamped so that you are aware of when the Privacy Policy was last updated.
