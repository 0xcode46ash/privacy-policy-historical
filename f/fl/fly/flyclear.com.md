### B. Information We Collect by Automated Means

We collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, when you visit our website. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits. A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain "clickstream data," which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website.

As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. Clickstream data also can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the website from which you linked to our site, and the pages you visit on our site. 

### i. How We Use the Information Collected by Automated Means

By collecting information through cookies, web beacons and other automated means, we learn how to best tailor this website to our visitors. We may use cookies to customize your visit to our site and deliver content consistent with your interests and the manner in which you browse the site. We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also may use IP addresses to help identify visitors to our site for the duration of a session and to gather demographic information about our visitors. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each web page of our site, how visitors navigate through the site, and how we may tailor our site to better meet the needs of our visitors. We also use the information for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including the enforcement of our Terms of Use. 

## II. Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you on this website, except as described here. We may share the information with our affiliates, marketing partners and other third parties to offer products or services that may interest you, and service providers who perform services on our behalf. We contractually prohibit our service providers from using or disclosing the information other than to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We require these service providers by contract to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they collect, use, disclose or otherwise process on our behalf.

In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, as permitted or required by law.

## III. Your Choices

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we collect about you on this website, such as how we use the information and how we communicate with you.

Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by CLEAR, we are not responsible for the sites’ content, any use of the sites, or the privacy practices of the sites.
