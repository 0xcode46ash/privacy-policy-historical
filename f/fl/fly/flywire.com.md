### Effective date: March 10, 2017

Flywire Payments Corporation, doing business as Flywire, and our subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Flywire”, “we”, “us”, “our”) respect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we may collect, use, and disclose information we obtain through our website and online services (the “Service”) and the choices you can make about the handling of the information.

### A. Information We Collect

We may obtain information about you in a variety of ways, such as when you voluntarily provide it to us, in our role as a processor of payment transactions, or when it is automatically sent to us by the device you use to access the Service. 

_Information We Collect From You_

When you use the Service, you may provide us with the following types of information: 

  * **Your Account information.** To create an account you will need to provide us with your name, email address, and password. We will also ask about your relationship with the person on whose behalf you are making a payment, if different from you. 
  * **Payment Information.** When submitting a payment through our Service, we ask the payer for information such as the payer’s name, address, phone number, and government identification number. You will also need to provide information about the person for whom you are submitting a payment. For example, when submitting a payment to an educational institution, we will also ask for the student’s name, student ID, invoice number, date of birth, year of graduation, educational institution, and student email address. When submitting a payment to a healthcare organization, we will ask the payer to provide information such as the patient’s name, medical record number or patient account number, bill identification number, and health care organization. As part of the payment process, or to process a refund or charge-back, we and/or our partners may need the payer’s financial account information, such as bank account numbers, names, and routing codes. 
  * **Referrals.** To invite others to use the Service, you may submit their names, emails, and, for students, their educational institution.

  * **Designated Entities.** We may be provided with your name and email address, before your create an account, from the educational institutions, healthcare providers and other entities for which we serve as a payment agent, in order to contact you to encourage you to make a payment through our Service.
