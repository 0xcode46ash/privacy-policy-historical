## Privacy

####  Maintaining your privacy

This Privacy Policy discloses Fly Buys information gathering and dissemination practices.  
It describes:

  * what information is gathered;
  * how this information is used and stored;
  * who the information will be shared with;
  * how members can opt out of Fly Buys mailings; and
  * how members can modify their personal information held by Fly Buys.



Information about members and secondary cardholders (whether provided by members or secondary cardholders directly to Fly Buys, or by participating companies and/or reward providers about member transactions) will be collected by Fly Buys. This information will be used by Fly Buys, and its agents, to provide services relating to the Fly Buys programme including to provide a telephone service centre, membership and secondary cards, Point Summaries and market research. Information from the database will also be used by Fly Buys for marketing purposes, planning, product development and research.

Each member consents to the collection and use of their personal and other information in the manner set out above and the disclosure of such information to Fly Buys' agents and reward providers for the purposes of operating the Fly Buys programme. Information about members and secondary cardholders may be disclosed to a participating company (or its agent) if:

  * the relevant member or secondary cardholder consents in writing; or
  * Fly Buys considers on reasonable grounds that that disclosure is necessary to enable the recording of points in relation to transactions of those members or secondary cardholders; or
  * the member or secondary cardholder is a prize winner in a competition or promotion run by or on behalf of that participating company and the information is disclosed for the sole purpose of enabling notification of the prize winner and/or making arrangements for the receipt of the prize; or
  * Fly Buys considers on reasonable grounds that the member or secondary cardholder may have been involved in fraudulent activities in relation to that participating company.



Information about members and secondary cardholders will not be provided by Fly Buys to any person except as provided in this Privacy Policy or [section 5 of Fly Buys Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Pages/site/terms_and_conditions) or permitted by the Privacy Act 1993.

Members have the right to opt out of mailings other than their Point Summary, by writing to the Fly Buys Service Centre, PO Box 68679, Newton, Auckland (no stamp required).

Members and secondary cardholders may, under the provisions of the Privacy Act 1993, request access to and correction of their personal information held by Fly Buys. These requests must be in writing. A fee may be charged for the reasonable costs incurred in responding to these requests. Any such fee will be disclosed to the member or secondary cardholder before it is incurred.

####  Important email security notice: avoiding scam or spoof emails

Fly Buys is dedicated to keeping your member details safe and secure form scams and fraud.

Please note that Fly Buys will never send you an email asking you to disclose your Member Number, points balance or any other personal details. Be suspicious of any email with urgent requests for such personal information as there is a high chance such communications are fraudulent.

A legitimate email from Fly Buys will always contain some of your personal details such as your first name, your Member Number or your points balance.

If you are ever in any doubt about the authenticity of any communications that are or seem to be from Fly Buys please immediately email us at [contact@flybuys.co.nz](mailto:contact@flybuys.co.nz) and include a copy of the email in question.
