# flybuys Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

At flybuys, we respect the privacy of your personal information in our care. This commitment is demonstrated in our Privacy Policy, which sets out our policy on dealing with personal information. Personal information means information which identifies you as an individual or from which your identity can be reasonably ascertained.

This Privacy Policy relates to personal information we handle about flybuys members, visitors to our website and other members of the public. Our personnel and job applicants can contact our human resources team for more information about their privacy.

**Privacy laws**

We are subject to a range of laws which protect your privacy, including the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) in the Privacy Act 1988. The NPPs set out how some private sector organisations should collect, use, store, disclose and provide access to personal information. Despite this Privacy Policy, we sometimes handle personal information relying on exemptions under these laws, for example in relation to employee records.
