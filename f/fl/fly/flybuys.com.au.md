**3.2** FlyBuys will not use or disclose or permit the use or disclosure of personal information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except:

    1. to ensure the proper functioning of the FlyBuys program in relation to the member in question (for example, to confirm membership and acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, to communicate points earned, to seek the member's views on the operation of the FlyBuys program in order to improve member service, to ensure the integrity of points processing by participating retailers, to communicate promotional offers and special events and to identify the member when awards are made) and for these purposes personal information will only be disclosed to FlyBuys or a service provider retained by FlyBuys under conditions of confidentiality;
    2. where the personal information is to be used by Coles Group Entities or NAB Group Entities for the purposes described in clause 3.3;
    3. otherwise, where the personal information is to be used by a participating retailer for marketing, planning, product development and research and where 
      1. the personal information does not include the name of the member; and
      2. the participating retailer is bound by a confidentiality agreement with FlyBuys under which the personal information may not be used for mailing purposes or in any other way to make contact with the member;
    4. when FlyBuys is required or authorised by law to disclose the personal information;
    5. for fraud and crime prevention and investigation; or
    6. when the member specifically consents in writing to the use or disclosure. 

Examples of the service providers referred to in paragraph 3.2(a) are data processing and data analysis agents, printing contractors and the FlyBuys Customer Service Centre. Information will only be provided to these agents to the extent necessary to enable them to undertake their contracted roles in the operation of the FlyBuys program.

**3.3** Coles Group Entities and NAB Group Entities may collect the member's name and other personal information from FlyBuys for marketing, planning, product development, research, FlyBuys account reconciliation, fraud and crime prevention and investigation and other related purposes.
