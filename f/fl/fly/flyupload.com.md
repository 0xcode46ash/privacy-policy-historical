# FlyUpload / Upload your file and share

FlyUpload is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This policy applies only to FlyUpload, and not to the web sites of other companies or organizations visited using FlyUpload.s anonymization service. Our privacy policy statement will help you understand FlyUpload's commitment to safeguarding your private information.

** Information Collection and Use**

FlyUpload does not collect any personal or individually identifiable information without the informed consent of the user. We will not sell, share, or rent your confidential information to third parties,  including individuals or other organizations.

** Intelligent Caching**

FlyUpload may occasionally use caching technology to cache frequently requested Web content. Caching mechanisms are used to serve web pages directly from the FlyUpload local storage as a means to make web performance faster and more efficient. We do not cache or locally store any end-to-end web content transfers, like e-commerce transactions, via the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

** Internet Cookies**

FlyUpload  may use a feature of your Internet browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer to maintain a session state. These short-lived cookies are not written to your hard drive and are removed when you close the browser. This means that not only are your web activities kept private, but also that your hard drive memory is not depleted. Our customizable user preferences feature uses a single cookie, which is stored on your local hard drive. This cookie is used for user customizable privacy options. FlyUpload does not, and will not, use cookies to retrieve personal information about you.

** Sharing**

We may share aggregate demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information and cannot identify any individual person.

** Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that FlyUpload is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information for their protection. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the FlyUpload web site.

** Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

** Server Log Files**

We use server logs to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for performance assessments and aggregate use. We do not log the sites that users visit. The logging data is collected as part of our attempt to monitor ongoing performance and service integrity in order to enhance our service offering. We have implemented strict technical and organizational measures to ensure that the log data is protected at all times and destroyed after statistical analysis by our security and performance engineering teams. Performance statistics logs are collected from time to time in order to evaluate the scalability of the FlyUpload service and/or introduce new service enhancements.

** Notification of Changes**
