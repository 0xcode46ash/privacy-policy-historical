At Florida Credit Union, your privacy is a top priority. When you provide personal   
information in order to process your transaction, you fully expect your data to be used only for its intended purpose and to be kept confidential. At Florida Credit Union, we respect your confidentiality and take every possible measure to ensure that your personal information is protected. Your membership is valuable to us and we hope to maintain a financial relationship with you for many years to come. 

This notice describes how we protect the privacy of your personal information. Throughout this notice, the word “information” refers to personal information about you that may not be publicly available.

We collect information about you and our former members from the following sources:  
Applications and other forms you submit to us; your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; representations made by you to us; representations made by other people regarding an employment, credit or other relationship with you; and consumer reporting agencies.

• We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above.  
• We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies   
that perform marketing services on our behalf (for example-check printing companies)   
or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

To protect our members’ privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of the information we provide. _ **We _do not_ permit these companies to sell to other third parties the information we provide to them**_. We may also disclose information about you under other circumstances, as permitted or required by law.

We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state laws and regulations to guard your information.

**Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New Account**  
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering   
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.

You should know that credit bureaus are permitted to sell your name, address and other contact information to companies that wish to market to you their credit or insurance products or services.

You have the right to prohibit the use of your file with any credit reporting agency in connection with any transaction that you did not initiate. You may exercise the right by notifying Equifax Options, PO Box 740123, Atlanta, GA 30374-0123;   
TransUnion, Name Removal Option, PO Box 97328, Jackson, MS 39288; Experian Consumer OPT-OUT, 901 W. Bond, Lincoln, NE 68521; or call 1-888-5OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688).

In addition, to stop telemarketers from calling you, you may enroll in the National Do Not Call Registry by calling 1-888-382-1222. By enrolling, telemarketers may not call you to sell goods or services unless you have a previous business relationship with them.
