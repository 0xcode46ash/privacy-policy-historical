Your privacy is important to us. FlatSixes.com maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy at our website. Here is what you can expect when you visit FlatSixes.com:

Other than to fulfill a request from you, we won't sell, rent or share any personally-identifiable information you provide without your consent.

â€¢We won't send you any unsolicited e-mail ("spam").

**The Information We Collect**

Our web servers automatically capture your domain name, the IP address of the web page from which you enter our site, the pages you visit on our site and the amount of time you spend here. We do not collect any information that can reveal your personal identity unless you voluntarily provide it when you register to use interactive features of the site, including the sales portal, or to receive information from us or our partners. The information we collect is not part of any designated record set. We do not knowingly collect or use information from children under 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian.

Personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by you may be retained indefinitely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

**Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks**

Any personally-identifiable information you give us will be used only to provide the product, service or information you have requested, or to support the program(s)/service(s) for which you registered. Unless you specifically consent to let us do so, your personally-identifiable information, including your e-mail address, will not be sold, rented, licensed, or otherwise shared with third parties. The non-personally identifiable information we gather in aggregate form may be used to improve our site, and we may share that information with our member/partner organizations.

**Making Changes to the Information You Provide to Us**

Information that you voluntarily provided will be maintained as long as FlatSixes.com deems appropriate to fulfill the purpose for which you provided the information or until you request us to remove it.

**Cookies**

When you visit FlatSixes.com, we may place a temporary "session" or a permanent cookie on your computer that will allow us to customize and enhance your experience at the site, make improvements to our site, or to report site activity. Our session cookies are not permanently stored on your computer and expire when you leave. Permanent cookies are issued only to site visitors who link the site from a search engine and are used only to permit FlatSixes.com to attract qualified users to the site. Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third party web sites or to send spam, nor will they provide us with any personally identifiable information about you. We store cookie information only in aggregate form and use the aggregate information only to make improvements to the site or in internal reports on site activity. You may use your browser controls to refuse to allow cookies to be placed on your computer. Refusing cookies disables our ability to include information about your visit in our regular monitoring of site traffic.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of our ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**Sites We Link To**

If you choose to use any of the links we provide to our member companies, sponsors, and other third party resources, you will be leaving our web site and going to a new web site. Protection of your privacy at those other sites will be governed by the privacy policy at that site. We've taken special care selecting the companies that appear or are linked to on FlatSixes.com and try to ensure that they respect your privacy as we do, but please take the time to read the privacy policies at their sites.

**Changes to this Policy**

If we make any changes to this policy, we'll let you know the effective date of the changes on our site.
