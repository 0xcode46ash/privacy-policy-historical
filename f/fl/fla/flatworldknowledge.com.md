**PRIVACY POLICY  
Effective as of March 17th, 2011**

We at Flat World Knowledge, Inc. (“Flat World Knowledge,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy applies to the online information collection and use practices with respect to flatworldknowledge.com, flatworldstudents.com, and our other websites (collectively, the “Websites”). By visiting our Websites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. 

**_The Information We Collect_**

  1. _Personal Information_

When you register to purchase products or services, when you register as an instructor, when you sign up for certain features on the Websites (such as viewing a webinar), and when you contact us through the Websites, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, and year of birth (collectively, the “Personal Information”). We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you visit the Websites unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily. 

  2. _Billing Information_

If you wish to purchase a product or service through the Websites, you may be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may include a credit card number, PayPal account number, and similar information (collectively, the “Billing Information).

  3. _Other Information_

In addition to the Personal Information noted above that you voluntarily provide to us, we may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:

    1. _From You._ Additional information about yourself that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your graduation year, major, courses, gender, hobbies, and interests. As a result of collecting course information, we will be able to discern other information, such as your school/institution, professors, course enrollment, start dates, midterm dates, and final exam dates. 

    2. _From Your Activity._ Information that we automatically collect when you visit the Websites, such as your IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Websites you visit, number of links you click while in the Websites, and similar information concerning your use of the Websites.

    3. _From Cookies._ Information that we collect using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We use cookies to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Websites. If you do not want the Websites to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from our Websites, the Websites may not function properly. 




**_The Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies_**

We may share Other Information about your activity on the Websites with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Websites and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us and these third-party advertisers to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. 

**_Accessing and Modifying Information_**

If you have registered for the Websites, you may access, review, and make changes to your Personal Information and/or your Billing Information by sending an email to our support attendants at [help@flatworldknowledge.com](mailto:help@flatworldknowledge.com). In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Flat World Knowledge marketing email. Registered users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. 

**_How We Use and Share the Information_**

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information to solicit your feedback, to inform you about our products and services and those of our third-party marketing partners, and to tailor messaging to you, including, without limitation, through the Online Reader and on other sections of the Websites. Also, we may use and/or share Personal Information and/or Other Information as described below.

  * We may from time to time share the Personal Information and/or the Other Information with other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. 

  * In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our products and services, we may analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and/or our products and services. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

  * We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, order fulfillment, billing, and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. 

  * If we or any of our affiliated companies (or all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any of our affiliated companies) are acquired, we expect that the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information would be transferred along with the other business assets. 

  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Flat World Knowledge or others. 




**_How We Protect Your Information_**

We strive to maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, we are unable to guarantee that security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that such information will remain secure under all circumstances.
