We don't collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our Website. Like many other commercial Websites, the Flexera Software Website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site.
