**Credit reference agencies, credit decisions and the prevention of fraud and money laundering**

When you apply or open an account with us, you agree that you have the full consent of all parties and any linked “financial associates” (if there are any) i.e. a person with who may have had or has a joint personal financial arrangement such as joint accounts or have made joint credit applications which may be your spouse or partner (not a business partner) We may also, in certain limited circumstances, check the records, including credit details, of other members of your family and if you are a director or partner in a small business, we may check your business.

Therefore if the applicant is for a sole trader, we may check any financial associate. If the application is for a business partnership, we may check each partner and their financial associates and if the application is for a limited company, we may check each director and shareholder and their financial associates. By submitting any application form, you agree that you have the full consent of each related party.

We may use credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to help us make decisions. A short guide to what we do and how both we and credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will use your information is set out below.

1\. When you apply to us to receive a loan, we will check the following records about you and others (see 2 below)

a. Our own records;

b. Records at Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. CRAs supply to us both public information (including information from the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information.

c. Records at Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPA’s)

We will make use of the information received as a result of these checks in order to assess your application for credit, verify your identity and to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us.

2\. Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your accounts and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.

3\. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect identity fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.

4\. If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.

5\. We and other organisations may access and use information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.
