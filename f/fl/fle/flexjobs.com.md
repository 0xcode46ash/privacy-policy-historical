**We Allow You To Update, Correct, Or Delete Your Personal Information  
**  
Upon your request, and to the extent your request does not compromise our privacy policies, we will update and correct personal information you have previously provided to us. In addition, if you request, we use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your name and personal information from our database. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to update your information, you may do so by revising the information you previously submitted. If you wish to remove your name from our database, please notify us in writing to this effect.  
 

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. We will post the changes here. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will apply prospectively, and we will maintain any personal information in accordance with the version of the Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to application of the revised Policy.
