## What cookies are

Cookies are a technology that can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is a small amount of data exchanged between your computer and ours. It's a code widely used by Web sites to track how customers access information. It also can be used to customize information and recall data so that you don't have to retype it. 

## How cookies work

A cookie includes an anonymous, unique identifier that we use when you "log in" to access your private account information. It reminds us of who you are in order to deliver to you better and more personalized service.

You're able to configure your browser to 

  * accept all cookies 
  * reject them, or 
  * notify you when a cookie is set. 



Check the Help menu on your browser for more information on your cookie settings. You may have to close and restart your browser for setting changes to take effect.

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use FPL's online applications that require you to log in. Other information on the Web site, however, still may be accessed. 

## Cookies are safe

It is important to note that cookies are safe. They cannot be executed as code or be used to deliver a virus, and personal information is not gathered from them, or stored on them.

## Web site security

The FPL Web site is secure. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. The service request forms use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology during data transmission to protect your communication and maintain your privacy.
