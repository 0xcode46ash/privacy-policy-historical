Privacy Policy

  * Fullscreen doesn't personally care who you are. That's your business. 
  * Fullscreen does not collect personal information about visitors to this site. 
  * Fullscreen will never give away your email address. We will not sell it either. We will only email members specifically about their membership (e.g. the monthly newsletter). 
  * Security - we do not collect personal information so we cannot do anything nasty with it, since we don't have it. Fullscreen may place deliver cookie files to your browser, especially if you log in to the member area of our site. These cookie files may be used to track surfing patterns on our site. However, you remain anonymous, as we have no idea who belongs to which cookie. Information gleaned from this tracking of surfing patterns is not made available to any third party. 
  * If you want to make your email address available on a ring you make, you can do that. We personally don't care. That's your business. 
  * If you fill out a form or survey on Fullscreen with personal information then we will simply add up all the results to get some overall feel for who our visitors are. We use this information to squeeze money out of advertisers. But we would never reveal specific information about you to advertisers or anyone else. 

This privacy was taken from the [Bomis.com](http://bomis.com/) privacy policy, because we didn't have the time to write one ourselves. We'll get to it, but for now, this states our policy quite well.  |
