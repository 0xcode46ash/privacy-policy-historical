#### What Information Do We Collect?

  * **Information That You Provide Us** We accept and store any information that you submit on Fullcompass.com or by any other means. For example, you may provide personal information when you place an order, enter a giveaway, request a publication, or contact us. This information may include name, address, phone numbers, email address, credit card and payment information, and other personal information.
  * **Web Site Use Information** We collect and analyze technical information about how customers interact with Fullcompass.com including, but not limited to, IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, pages viewed, links, dates and times, and other information.
  * **Cookies** Like many websites, we utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to differentiate you from other shoppers and to store and retrieve information about your interaction with the website, like the items in your shopping cart or wish list for example.
  * **Email Information and Contact Forms** We may collect, store, and use any information that you submit via email or any of the forms on our website. We may also collect information about email communications such as confirming that an email was opened or which links were clicked.



#### How We Use Collected Information

We use collected information for the purpose of administering our business activities such as completing and tracking orders, customer service, communicating with customers, administering giveaways and other promotions, customizing the shopping experience, troubleshooting, improving the website design and functionality, and other business uses. From time to time, we may send you promotional messages by mail or email. You will always have the option to opt out of such communications ([see below](http://www.fullcompass.com/news/88.html#optout)).

We do not intentionally share your information with third parties except as required by law or to facilitate business operations (such as shipping partners and payment processors).

#### How We Protect Your Information

In order to protect your information, we have put in place appropriate electronic, physical, and procedural safeguards. We utilize standard encryption/security technology to protect data transfer and our information systems are treated with the highest regard for security. In addition, we limit access to customer information to only authorized personnel.

#### Your Order & Fraud Protection

In the event of a criminal investigation or a suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain personal information.

Because we are interested in protecting you from credit card fraud and keeping our prices low all orders are subject to review by our fraud detection department. As part of this review we may require that your order ships to the billing address of your credit card or an authorized alternate address. We may also need to call or email you to further clarify any questions we may have.

The billing address of your card is the address that your monthly statement is mailed to. It is important that you provide us with this address correctly because we use this address in our verification process.

If for some reason you cannot have your order shipped to your billing address you may contact the card company and have them add an alternate authorized address to your account. We will be able to verify this address when we process your order.

Most banks will not allow an alternative address to be added to your debit card. If you need to have your order shipped to an alternative address we encourage you to not use a debit card.

Please feel free to call us if you need any special accommodations regarding your order and we will do our best to help you.

#### How You Can Review or Correct Your Information

To review or correct your personal information, or to change your communication preferences, please call us at 800-356-5844. Your Sales Pro will be glad to help.
