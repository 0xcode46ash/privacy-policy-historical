# Full Compass Systems - Privacy Statement

**FULL COMPASS, Ltd. PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
We respect your right to privacy and want to adhere to your preferences about receiving unsolicited email and direct mail. Please be assured that we will honor your decisions about the use of your email and postal addresses.

**What personal information does Full Compass Systems gather from me?**

** Information You Give Us: **  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way, including name, business name and title (as applicable), street address, e-mail address, phone number, and data associated with any transactions with you. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling your orders, improving our store and service, and communicating with you. **Automatic Information:**  
Full Compass Systems and its affiliated web sites do not employ the use of cookies. Cookies are small identifiers that may be transferred to your computer's hard drive using your web browser. These cookies may be used to keep track of items, to provide you with customized content and to remember information you entered so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit a particular site. Many browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can set up your browser to refuse to accept cookies. The "help" portion of your toolbar on your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have your browser notify you when you receive new cookies, or how to disable cookies all together. 

Our Web server automatically creates a log file that contains such general information as where the visitor originated from, what type of browser and operating system the visitor is using, and which Full Compass Systems web pages were visited. Full Compass Systems reviews these log files to help us identify ways in which we can improve our site. Please note that the identity of the visitor is not revealed or recorded in the log files, securing your privacy. 

**How does Full Compass Systems use my personal information?**

If you choose to register or receive products or materials from us, or to otherwise give us personal and/or business-specific information, we may store some or all of that personal information and use it for our marketing purposes. 

Full Compass Systems believes that our relationship with you is best served through conversations with you. As such, we will give you a single source for all of your sales and customer service needs. In that spirit, customer orders are not processed through our web site. We encourage you to call your sales professional today to discuss our products and place your order. 

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog as well as e-mail updates on our new products and services. 

We use e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We may also use these e-mail addresses to communicate our product promotions, distribute our product related newsletter and to respond to queries. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving our e-mail promotional communications. 

We will never sell your personally identifiable information to any other company. 

In the event of a criminal investigation or a suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain personal information. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**   
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. All products presented on our website are intended for adults. If you are under the age of 13, you may use fullcompass.com only with the approval and involvement of your parent or guardian. 

**Your Consent**   
By using our website, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal and associated business information as described above. Full Compass Systems reserves the right to change this privacy policy and if we do, any such changes will be e-mailed to our registered users. Additionally, such changes will be included on this page so current privacy information will always be available to you.
