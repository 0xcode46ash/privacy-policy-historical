This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.

### **A. Personally-Identifiable Information:**

FullMoneySystem.com typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to FullMoneySystem.com through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want FullMoneySystem.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that FullMoneySystem.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to admin@FullMoneySystem.com , however, FullMoneySystem.com reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your FullMoneySystem.com services. Absent any instructions from you, FullMoneySystem.com may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the FullMoneySystem.com family of companies, FullMoneySystem.com authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom FullMoneySystem.com has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. FullMoneySystem.com will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those FullMoneySystem.com sites where you may provide FullMoneySystem.com with credit card or other ordering information via the web, FullMoneySystem.com protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET).

FullMoneySystem.com gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about FullMoneySystem.com services).
