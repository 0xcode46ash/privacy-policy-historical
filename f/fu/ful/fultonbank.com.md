We recognize that satisfying those expectations is an important cornerstone in building and preserving our customers' trust in us. With that in mind, we have adopted the following Privacy Principles. These Principles represent our commitment to our customers concerning how we will collect, use and maintain the information our customers choose to share with us. We will collect, use and maintain information about our customers only in compliance with applicable state and federal law.

**Collection and Use of Customer Information**

We will collect and use information about our customers only where we reasonably believe the information will be necessary or useful to provide to our customers the products and services they request from us, as well as to help us identify new opportunities to provide products, services and information to help our customers achieve financial success. The information we collect and use about our customers helps us to maintain the security of our customers' accounts with us, improve the customer service we provide, and operate more efficiently, so we can keep the cost of the products and services our customers obtain from us low.

**Accuracy of Customer Information**

The accuracy of the information we collect and maintain is important both to us, and to our customers. We have established procedures which we believe reasonably ensure that customer information is accurate, current and complete, consistent with the intended use of the information. We will respond promptly to requests to correct any information which is inaccurate.

**Employee Access to Information**

Our Code of Conduct sets forth our fundamental expectations concerning access to, and the proper use of customer information by our employees. Employees who violate our Code of Conduct are subject to disciplinary action. We have also established security and other procedures which we believe are reasonably designed to limit our employees' access to customer information to only that information necessary to perform their job functions. We provide training to our employees concerning the proper use of our customers' information and the security and other procedures we use to safeguard that information.

**Confidentiality and Security of Customer Information**

We employ various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards which we believe reasonably protect the confidentiality and security of the information we collect and maintain concerning our customers.

**Information We are Permitted to Share**

Sharing this information enables us and our affiliates to provide to our customers the products and services they request from us, as well as to help us identify new opportunities to provide products, services and information to help our customers achieve financial success.

When we provide access to information concerning our customers to unaffiliated third parties, such as data processing companies, who assist us in providing products and services to our customers, or companies who have entered into joint marketing agreements with us to offer certain financial products, we require those third parties to agree to protect the confidentiality of our customers' information and we prohibit those nonaffiliated third parties from using our customers' information for any other purpose.
