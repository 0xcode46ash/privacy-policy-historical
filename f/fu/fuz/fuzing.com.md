1\. The Information We Collect 

1.1 Registration Information.  
At the time you register to become a Registered User of the Site, you will be asked to fill out a registration form which requires you provide information such as your name, address, phone/fax number, email address and other personal information as well as information about your business (“Registration Information”). In the event that you decide to publish a product/service listing, or if you elect to have your own Fuzing site prefix (i.e. youcompany.fuzing.com) then much of your Registration Information will be published on our site and becomes "Publishing Information" (see next section).

1.2 Publishing Information.  
If you submit any information to Fuzing.com to be published on the Site through the publishing tools, including but not limited to our Company Directory (Extended Profile), Trade/Product/Service Listings, then you are deemed to have given consent to the publication of such information (“Publishing Information”). Once you have elected to publish this information then much of your Registration Information becomes Publishing Information (notable exceptions: we will never publish your username, password or email address - nor will we ever publish Payment Information [see next section]).

1.3 Payment Information.  
If you upgrade to a premium Fuzing service we collect additional information, including billing information, which may include credit card numbers and expiration dates (“Payment Information”). The security of your Payment Information is important to us. When you enter this information we encrypt it using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL).

The promoting member has full control over the information that is being published and may change it at any time.  


The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Google’s AdSense program and Yahoo Search Marketing, our advertising partners.

6\. Cookies 

We use “cookies” to store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. We also use the information that we store in cookies to link to your Personal Identifying Information. It is not uncommon for web sites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.

A cookie can be sent to your computer’s hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer.   
If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utilities) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Fuzing.com at www.fuzing.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.

Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to access your Registration Information, Publishing Information or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by Users; research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on User interests; assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions.

You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your browser which is installed in the computer you are using to access the Site.

If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser.

By setting your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is sent, or you can reject all cookies.

If you reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, you may be required to re-enter your information on our Site more often and certain features of our Site may be unavailable. 

7\. Minors 

The Site and its contents are not intended to be targeted to minors under applicable law and we do not intend to sell any of our products or services to minors.

However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. 

If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information. 

8\. Security Measures 

8.1 We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. 

8.2 As a Registered User, your Registration Information, Publishing Information and Payment Information (if any) can be viewed and edited through your Account which is protected by Password.  
We recommend that you do not divulge your Password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share a computer with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information (e.g., User ID and Password) on the computer. Remember to sign out of your Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. 

8.3 No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your information, no web site or company, including ourselves, can absolutely ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
