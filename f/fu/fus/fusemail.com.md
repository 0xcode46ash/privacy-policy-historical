# Privacy Policy - FuseMail

**Fusemail Privacy Policy**

In this policy (the “Privacy Policy”), “Fusemail” or “we” shall mean (i) Electric Mail Company, (ii) Fusemail Ireland Limited, (iii) Fusemail UK Limited or (iv) Critical Software Limited, as appropriate. Fusemail is dedicated to establishing trusting relationships with our customers (known hereafter as “users”), based on respect for personal identity and information, by promoting the use of fair information practices. This Privacy Policy explains the practices and policies of Fusemail regarding the collection and protection of personal information supplied by users or collected by us from users of Fusemail’s websites, (the “Websites”). To the extent that there is any conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the provisions of the agreements that each user enters with Fusemail (the “Customer Agreement”), the provisions of the Customer Agreement shall prevail.

By using the Websites, users agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2) that Fusemail may process (i.e., collect, use, store etc.) users’ personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement. We do not share personal information obtained from users on our Websites except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Because Fusemail wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy, we are disclosing:

  1. What personal information Fusemail collects and how Fusemail uses the personal information.
  2. How cookies and other technologies are used on our Websites.
  3. What communications may be sent to users from Fusemail.
  4. To whom Fusemail may disclose a user’s personal information.
  5. What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the personal information.
  6. What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the personal information to the extent under Fusemail control.
  7. How a user can correct any inaccuracies in that user’s personal information.
  8. How Fusemail retains and deletes a user’s personal information.



We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our Websites. If a revision materially alters users’ rights with regard to personal information, we will notify each user (including those users who have selected to opt-out from receiving promotional materials, so all users are always aware of what personal information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it). Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their personal information in this different manner.

  1. **Information Collection and Use**



**Information Collection**

Fusemail is the sole owner of the information collected on its Websites. Fusemail collects personal information from its users at several different points on its Websites and in the delivery of its services, both directly from users and in limited instances as set out in this Privacy Policy through the use of cookies, log files and clear gifs. ** **

**Registration**

In order to use Fusemail services, a user will be asked to first enter a Customer Agreement and provide us with certain prescribed contact and personal information. We use this personal information in order to provide services for users and to contact users about our services. Where applicable we may send a user a welcome email to verify certain details. ** **

**Information Use**

Personal information is used in the following ways:

  1. Provision of Services. Used to set up a user’s account, provide the services and support set out in the Customer Agreement, and to communicate with users regarding other account related issues.
  2. Email Correspondence. Used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to distribute information about Fusemail, our products, and services.
  3. To comply with all applicable laws or binding orders served on Fusemail.
  4. To protect and defend the rights or property of Fusemail.
  5. To act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its users or the public. ** **



**Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that personal information from our systems. ** **

**Telephone Call Recording**

We record all our telephone calls to or from users for the purposes of training, improvement of services, fraud prevention and to ensure the accuracy of instructions communicated to us. All telephone recordings shall be our property.

**Supplementation of Personal Information**

In order for Fusemail to properly fulfill its obligations to users, it is necessary for us to supplement the personal information we receive with information from third party sources. Fusemail verifies the billing address on all credit card transactions and may obtain credit reports for some corporate users. The information obtained from these third party sources is maintained in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

  2. **Use of Cookies and Other Technologies**



**Cookie Policy** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any identifiable personal information while on our Websites. By using and browsing our Websites, users consent to the use by us and third parties of cookies and other technologies in accordance with our Cookie and Privacy Policies. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time, which enables us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Persistent cookies can be removed, please refer to the applicable internet browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. 

By setting a cookie on one of our Websites, users do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Websites. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our Websites. The only drawback if a user decides to disable cookies, is that the user may not be able to use certain services or facilities on the Websites.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Websites (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This Cookie Policy covers the use of cookies by Fusemail only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. ** **

**Log Files**

Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the Websites, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to identifiable personal information. ** **

**Clear Gifs**

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to identifiable personal information. We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please refer to the Choice/Opt-out section. ** **

**Profile**

We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on users that details each user’s viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information may be tied to the user’s identifiable personal information to provide offers and improve the content of our Websites for the user. This profile may be used to tailor a user’s visit to our Websites, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of a user’s profile with other third parties, such profiles are shared in aggregate form only.

  3. **Communications from the Website**



**Special Offers and Updates**

Users will occasionally receive emails containing information about us, updates on new service features, service usage tips, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to users, and user satisfaction questions. Users may opt-out of such notices – please refer to the Choice / Opt-out section. ** **

**Service Announcements**

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Users may not opt-out of these communications. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. ** **

**Customer Service**

We have the right to communicate with any user following a request by a user, in order to provide requested services or resolve issues. Such communication may be by email or phone, in accordance with the user’s wishes.

  4. **Disclosing personal information**



**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose users’ personal information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) investigate fraud or other criminal activity; or (d) protect the rights, property, or safety of Fusemail, our users, or others.

**Civil Subpoena Policy  **

Fusemail does not release personal information about our users except in limited instances related to law, security, or safety. To request a user’s personal information from Fusemail in a civil case, a person must serve Fusemail with a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant and agree to Fusemail’s terms of compensation below. All civil subpoenas should be directed to: ** **

Electric Mail Company Inc. 300-3999 Henning Drive, Burnaby, BC, V5C 6P9, Canada

 or:

 j2 Global Ireland Limited. Legal Department Unit 3, Woodford Business Park Santry, Dublin 17 Ireland Fax: +353 1 633 5741  

Upon receipt of a valid subpoena, it is Fusemail’s policy to notify the user whose personal information is sought. In non-emergency circumstances, Fusemail will generally not produce the subpoenaed user’s personal information until approximately two weeks after receipt of the subpoena, unless a formal objection is filed by the user or we are legally required to do so ** **

**Fusemail charges US$90.00 per hour for research (plus additional fees if testimony or deposition is required), US$0.25 per page, and US$22.00 to respond via express courier (or equivalent amounts in local currency). We will invoice the person or entity submitting the subpoena following receipt and the subpoena proponent must make payment within 15 days from the date of receipt of our invoice. Payment should be made out to Fusemail, Inc. or Fusemail Ireland Ltd. respectively.** ** **

**It is Fusemail’s policy to release information sufficient to identify a user only where the party seeking the personal information has filed a legal action that implicates the user in some legally cognizable impropriety or wrongdoing or can show that the personal information requested is material to the issues involved in the underlying case. Fusemail requests a copy of the complaint and all supporting documentation to indicate how the user’s personal information is related to the pending litigation. Note that Fusemail reserves the right to determine in its sole discretion the applicability of this policy to any particular request and, further, this policy does not create any enforceable legal rights, either for our users or for requesting parties.**

**Third Party Intermediaries**

We may use third parties to host certain portions of our Websites and to fulfill certain requests for personal information from our users. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personal information for any secondary purposes.

  5. **Choices regarding collection and use of personal information**



**Choice/Opt-out**

When the user originally enters a contract with Fusemail, the user will be asked whether they wish to receive promotional material from Fusemail. If the user does not wish to receive this information, they should select the appropriate options at this stage.

Users acknowledge and agree that Fusemail may occasionally send users communications about our products and services via email. Users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ from receiving this information by clicking the opt-out link included at the bottom of every promotional email.

Users of our sites are always notified when their personal information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. ** **

**Links**

Our Websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Fusemail is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Websites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to personal information collected by Fusemail through its Websites. Fusemail has advertising and affiliate relationships with dozens of third party sites which drive interested parties to our sites. Information that is collected on these sites does not fall within the auspices of this policy. Fusemail has Co-Brand relationships with some websites. A site is a Co-Brand of Fusemail if it offers Fusemail technology or services to its users under a different brand. The Co-Branded sites will have their own privacy policies specific to each site, and the user should read them carefully before registration. ** **

**Surveys**

Periodically, our site requests personal information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this personal information. The requested personal information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of Fusemail’s services. Users’ personal information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and a choice to opt-out. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use a user’s personal information for any secondary purposes.

  6. **Security precautions in place**



**Security**

Fusemail takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users’ personal information. When users submit personal information via Websites, this personal information is protected both online and off-line. In the event that the Customer Agreement is terminated, all personal information is destroyed carefully pursuant to the terms of the Data Retention section of this Privacy Policy.

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive personal information (such as credit card number), that sensitive personal information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive personal information online, we also employ security measures to protect our users’ personal information off-line. All of our users’ personal information, not just the sensitive personal information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only Fusemail representatives who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerks or a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. Finally, the servers that store personal information are in a secure environment.

  7. **Accessing/Correcting/Updating/Deleting Personal Information**



Fusemail makes good faith efforts to provide users with access to their personal information and to correct this personal information if it is inaccurate or to delete such personal information at users’ request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law. Users are required to identify themselves and the personal information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before we process such requests. This can be done by contacting our customer service agents. In the event that users have any queries in relation to their personal information held by Fusemail in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the user should send an email to **fuseprivacy@fusemail.com**.

  8. **Data Retention and Destruction**



The time period for which we keep personal information varies according to what the personal information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep personal information for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the personal information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal information was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
