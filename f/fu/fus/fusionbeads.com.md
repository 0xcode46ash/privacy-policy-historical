**At Fusion Beads Incorporated, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders only. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.**

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Note that Fusion Beads does not store customer credit card information once an order is placed. This information is transmitted securely (see below) to a credit card processing company that maintains the highest level of security.

**How do we protect customer information?**  
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts the information you input before it is sent to the Web server. We then retrieve all orders using an encrypted connection, ensuring the safety of your personal and credit card information. All customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

We use a 256-bit encryption SSL certificate through Verisign to ensure the highest level of security when you place orders with us. SSL provides secure communication by combining the following two elements:

  1. **Authentication** \- A digital certificate is tied to a specific domain, and a certification authority (an independent and trusted third-party company - ours is Verisign) performs a number of checks to confirm the identity of the organization requesting the certificate prior to issuing it. In this way, the certificate may only be installed on the domain against which it has been authenticated, providing users with the assurance they need.
  2. **Encryption** \- Encryption is the process of transforming information to make it unintelligible to all but the intended recipient. This forms the basis of data integrity and privacy necessary for e-commerce.



**Will we disclose the information to outside parties?**  
Fusion Beads Incorporated does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. This information is for our private records only.

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Fusion Beads Incorporated. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.
