# Privacy Policy | NUVOtv

Sí TV, Inc. d/b/a NUVOtv ("NUVOtv", “we”, “us”, or “our”) has created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our users (“you” or “your”). The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for MYNUVOtv.COM, and any other website under which we conduct business. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our Terms of Use ([http://www.myNUVOtv.com/termsofuse](http://www.mynuvotv.com/termsofuse)). Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in our Terms of Use. Both this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use are legally binding on all users.

## YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS / MODIFICATIONS

By using our websites, you indicate your acceptance of all terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please discontinue use of our websites. Your continued use of any NUVOtv website following the posting of changes to these terms indicates your acceptance of those changes. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting.

## USE OF IP ADDRESSES

An IP address is a number which is assigned to your computer when you are online. Web servers identify your computer by its IP address. NUVOtv collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, and to audit the use of our site. When you request pages from NUVOtv websites, our servers log your IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to NUVOtv and other users. We may use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to (i) enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, (ii) protect our service, site, customers or others, and/or (iii) comply with (a) a request from a governmental agency, (b) regulation, or (c) legal action.

## USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make browsing the Internet easier for you by saving your preferences while you access a website. By showing how and when users use a website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the NUVOtv web content are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users' needs.

NUVOtv uses cookies primarily in two ways. First, we use them to specify unique preferences so that you do not have to tell us repeatedly about the content you are interested in. Second, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns, so we can improve areas of the NUVOtv online experience that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, you always have the option of disabling cookies via your (i) browser preferences and/or (ii) Macromedia Flash application which allows you to view videos on NUVOtv. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can control Flash cookies via the Macromedia Flash application on your computer, or by going to the Macromedia Flash Player website, which allows you to view, modify, and delete Flash cookies. Please note that some parts of the NUVOtv service may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.

  


## PLUGINS

Our website uses social plugins (“Plugins”) provided by various social networks (“Platform(s)”). The Plugins are surrounded, or framed, by the NUVOtv webpage (i.e. NUVOtv colors scheme, messaging and content surrounds Plugins); however, NUVOtv controls very few of Plugins’ functions. For example, NUVOtv doesn’t control the Platform’s collection of user data, at the same time some Plugins may still (i) allow NUVOtv to filter, delete, and/or edit Posts (as defined below), and (ii) share user information with NUVOtv.

If you are a Platform member and do not want that Platform to connect the data about your visit to our website with your member data already stored by the Platform, please log off of the Platform before entering our website. You can also block Plugins by using browser add-ons.

We have no control of the data gathered by Plugins. When you visit any page of our website that contains a Platform Plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to that Platform’s servers. Then the Platform directly transfers the Plugin content to your browser which embeds the Plugin into our website, this enables the Platform to receive information about you accessing that particular NUVOtv webpage.

Thus, if you are logged into a Platform, your visit can be matched to your Platform’s account. If you interact with the Plugins, for example by clicking “Like” or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to the Platform and stored by it. The Platform may also let others know that you have visited the NUVOtv website or particular pages. Even if you are not logged into a Platform, the Plugins may still transmit your IP-address, and information about your location, browser and computer to the Platform.

To the extent that a Plugin allows, NUVOtv reserves the right to (i) filter, delete, and/or edit Posts, and (ii) accept monitor and copy user information from the Platform.

The creation, availability, and popularity of Platforms and Plugins changes frequently, so we may add or delete Plugins at any time. For your reference, below is a more detailed description of some of the Plugins you may find on our webpages.

Posts do not reflect the views of NUVOtv, any of its affiliated or related partners or companies, or any of their respective websites or services.

Even if you subsequently see or learn of a presentation, motion picture, still photograph, film, video or any other content which appears to incorporate any idea or concept or include anything similar or identical to that contained in any video or other Post that you or anyone else submits to or through the Plugins, you acknowledge and agree that you shall not be entitled to any compensation. You understand, acknowledge and agree that we assume no responsibility for deletion of Posts or any other matter relating to Posts.
