This Privacy Policy covers online privacy and data protection practices of the FuelX Website.

By using the FuelX Website, you signify your consent to this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use posted on the FuelX Website. This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the FuelX Website.

1\. Managing Your Information.

You may review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information, or remove your Personal Information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by changing the relevant setting in your FuelX user profile or by contacting us by emailing us at legal@fuelx.com or in writing at FuelX Legal Affairs, 202 Green Street, San Francisco, CA 94111. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us the same way.

2\. Information We Collect On Our Website.

(a) Personal Information. We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, username, email address, credit card details, and such other information as we may from time to time request (“Personal Information”) only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register with the FuelX Website. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the FuelX Website. 

(b) Non-Personal Information. We automatically collect anonymous usage information that does not identify an individual user (“Non-Personal Information”) to help us understand how users use the FuelX Website. For example, each time you use the FuelX Website we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the FuelX Website. 

(c) Cookies and Web Beacons. We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) to improve the quality of the FuelX Website. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the FuelX Website may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

3\. How We Use Personal And Non-Personal Information We Collect.

(a) General. We use Non-Personal Information and Personal Information for internal purposes only, such as to notify you of new products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve the FuelX Website, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the FuelX Website, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements on or through the FuelX Website. We also use the data we collect to determine your preferences, which in turn enables us to make our marketing and advertising services more useful to you. These services include making product recommendations to you in the form of online advertisements sent by our Clients or by us on our Clients’ behalf. You can opt-out of having us automatically collect your data for the purpose of serving personalized content to you at any time by clicking [here](http://fuel451.com/opt-out/). Please note that this doesn’t mean that you won’t see ads or recommendations. Rather, you’ll see a generic ad or recommendation in place of personalized content because no data related to you individually will have been used in our services. 

Non-Personal Information and Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered on or through the FuelX Website. We will not sell, share or rent Personal Information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose Personal Information to third parties, without your express permission or as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 

(b) Service Providers. From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, DNS providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information for purposes other than as specified by FuelX. 

(c) Standard Analytics Information. We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the FuelX Website (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.).
