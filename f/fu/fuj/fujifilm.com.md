For example, we may track that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but this process does not involve disclosing anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. Fujifilm abides by this requirement.
