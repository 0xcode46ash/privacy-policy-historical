# Fujifilm USA | Privacy Statement

**Privacy Policy**  
Effective Date: August 30, 2007

**Our Commitment to Privacy.** Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page on our websites and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**Scope of the Privacy Policy.** This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted on the Fujifilm Holdings America Corporation, Inc. ("FUJIFILM") websites (including, but not limited to, [http://www.fujifilmusa.com](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/), [http://www.yourpix.com ](http://www.yourpix.com/), [http://www.fujifilmmall.com ](http://www.fujifilmmall.com/), [http://www.offzhook.com ](http://www.offzhook.com/)).

**The Information We Collect.** The information we learn from customers helps us continually improve our websites and our service to you. The information we collect falls into two broad categories: (1) information you provide to us and (2) automatic information.

_Information you provide to us._ We may collect and store any information you voluntarily provide to us while on our websites. You may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number when, for example, you create an account with us, enter a sweepstakes or contest, sign up for a newsletter, request product information or a product brochure, or correspond with us via e-mail. To order products or services, you may be asked to provide additional information, including credit card information. This information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties, except to certain third party service providers as described below. Certain examples of how you provide us information include:

When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify the winners. You have the option to indicate on the registration form if you would like to receive promotional information as well as updates on new products and services from FUJIFILM via e-mail. Your information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with parties other than the contest sponsors, unless you elect to receive such materials.

When you sign up to receive FUJIFILM’s My Best Shot eNewsletter ([fuji.thepipeline.us/reg_form.cfm ](http://fuji.thepipeline.us/reg_form.cfm)), we ask for your name, e mail address, zip code, gender and whether there are any children under the age of 18 in your household. We also ask you to provide detailed information about your camera, your interests involving photography and how you ordinarily print your photographs. This information is used to help us to better understand and serve our audience for the My Best Shot eNewsletter and is not shared with outside parties. If FUJIFILM decides to produce other newsletters, we will collect comparable personal information and use such information for a similar purpose. If either the information that we collect or our use of that information changes materially, such changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy.

When you register a product or warranty, we ask for your name, address, phone number, date of birth, e-mail address, product name and purchase information so that we can administer the product registration and warranty program, in the event your product needs repair or service. You have the option to indicate on the registration form if you would like to receive promotional information as well as updates on new products and services from FUJIFILM’s marketing partners.

When you submit a product for service or repair through the FUJIFILM websites, we ask for your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, product name, product serial number, and the nature of the problem with the product so that we can diagnose the problem and inform you of the nature and extent of any repair or service required. If you wish to pay for the repair or service by credit card, we will also ask you for your credit card number, type, and expiration date.

To order products and/or services, you will be further required to provide your name, e-mail address, user name, password, mailing address, phone number, billing name, billing address and phone number, and credit card number, type and expiration date. When you place an order, you have the option to indicate on the order form if you would like promotional information as well as product updates. In order to fulfill your orders for products and/or services, information you provide may be transmitted to and/or collected by third party service providers.

If you are a government employee and you submit our Request Information Form ([www.fujifilmusa.com/JSP/fuji/epartners/GovernmentForm.jsp ](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/JSP/fuji/epartners/GovernmentForm.jsp)), we ask for your name, job title, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, and the name of the government agency that you represent. We also ask you to identify the types of cameras, film, printers, printing supplies and recording media that you are interested in learning more about. You have the option to indicate if you would like to be added to our e-mail list. If FUJIFILM decides to post additional Request Information Forms, we will collect comparable personal information and use such information for a similar purpose. If either the information that we collect or our use of that information changes materially, such changes will be reflected in this Privacy Policy.

When you fill out an application for a grant or donation, you will leave the FUJIFILM websites and enter the CyberGrants, Inc. website ([www.cybergrants.com ](http://www.cybergrants.com/)). You will be asked to provide your name, occupation, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number. Your information will be used by our agent, CyberGrants, Inc., solely for purposes of processing your request. To learn more about how CyberGrants, Inc. keeps your data secure, please refer to their privacy policy ([www.cybergrants.com/privacy.shtml ](http://www.cybergrants.com/privacy.shtml)).

When you download the Z-Clip TM editing software ("Z-Clip") from our websites, you must register and provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and date of birth (the "Registration Information") so that you can participate in contests and promotions. In addition to enabling you to edit and save your videos, photographs and sound files and to share that content via e-mail or to upload it to various websites, Z-Clip enables us and our licensor, VideoThang, Inc., to serve advertisements to you and to track certain behaviors in connection with your use of Z-Clip by tracking certain non-personally identifiable information, such as your computer’s IP address. This advertising service includes, among other things, tracking the frequency with which you access Z-Clip and the quantity and type of advertisements viewed by you through Z-Clip. Once FUJIFILM discontinues its subscription to the advertising services, your Registration Information will be collected and owned by VideoThang, and its use will be governed by VideoThang’s privacy policy at [http://www.videothang.com ](http://www.videothang.com/). If and when Z-Clip is no longer available for download, VideoThang may continue to track certain behaviors in connection with your use of Z-Clip through the tracking of certain non-personally identifying information as described above.

When you submit a question or request information through our websites, we ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number and a limited amount of information about your computer (i.e., your computer operating system). We collect this information so that we may quickly and efficiently route your message to the appropriate support staff member in order to provide you with a response or send you the information you request. This information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties.

_Automatic Information._ We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our websites. For example, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience on the websites. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our websites, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also relieve you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the websites where you have previously entered preference information. We also use web beacons (also known as "single-pixel GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit our websites or open HTML-formatted e-mail messages. We collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet to allow us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our websites.

If you enter the FUJIFILM websites through another company’s website, your information may be subject to additional privacy policies.

**Links to Third Party Sites.** The FUJIFILM websites may contain links to third party websites ("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of FUJIFILM and FUJIFILM is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including without limitation any link contained in a Linked Site, or any changes or updates to a Linked Site. FUJIFILM is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any Linked Site nor is FUJIFILM responsible if the Linked Site is not working appropriately. FUJIFILM is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by FUJIFILM of the site or any association with its operators. The Linked Site may contain its own privacy policy governing the collection and use of your information, and FUJIFILM is not responsible for the use of any information submitted to the Linked Sites. You are responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy statements and terms of use posted at the Linked Sites.

Any dealings with third parties (including advertisers) included within the FUJIFILM websites or participation in promotions, including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and the advertiser or other third party. FUJIFILM shall not be responsible or liable for any part of any such dealings or promotions.

In addition, FUJIFILM hosts image fulfillment, including digital camera developing, websites on behalf of various third parties (the "DCD Websites"). While the DCD Websites are hosted by FUJIFILM, any information submitted to these third party websites will be governed by the applicable third party privacy policies, as posted on the DCD Websites, and FUJIFILM is not responsible for the use of any information submitted to the DCD Websites. You are responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy statements and terms of use posted at the DCD Websites.

**The Way We Use Information.** In addition to uses described above, we use non-identifying and aggregate information to enhance the design of our websites and help us understand the needs of our site visitors. For example, we may track that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our websites, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but this process does not involve the disclosure of any personally identifiable information.

All credit card transactions are handled by third party financial institutions and its vendors, which receive your credit card information and other personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of verifying the credit card numbers and to process the requested transaction.

**Forced Disclosure of Information.** FUJIFILM will also disclose personal information when required by law or valid court order, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  * Comply with the law;
  * Protect and defend the rights and property of FUJIFILM or the users of its sites; or
  * Act under difficult circumstances to protect the personal safety of FUJIFILM’s employees, users of its sites, or the public.



**Our Commitment to Data Security.** Finally, we never use the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the uses described above without also providing an opportunity for you to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Anytime you submit credit card information during a transaction, the information is encrypted prior to sending through a secure connection to third party financial institutions and its vendors for processing.

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy.** Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our websites from users who we actually know to be under the age of 13. No parts of our websites are structured to attract anyone under 13.

**How to Contact Us.** If you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an e-mail at [webquestions@fujifilm.com.](mailto:webquestions@fujifilm.com)

**Changes to the Privacy Statement.** FUJIFILM reserves the right to change, amend, or update this Privacy Policy. If we do decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, under what circumstances we may disclose it, and to whom we may disclose it. Continued use of our websites after any posted revision indicates your consent to our use your information in accordance with the changed, amended, or updated Privacy Policy.
