# Privacy Statement | Fujifilm Americas

## FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation

## Website Privacy Policy

**Our Commitment to Privacy.** FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation and its direct subsidiaries listed [here](http://www.fujifilm.com/about/office/#north_america) (collectively, "FUJIFILM" or "we") care about your privacy. This Privacy Policy will help you better understand the online information practices that apply when visiting FUJIFILM's site and the choices you can make about the way your personal data is collected and used.

Through FUJIFILM's site, you will be able to link to sites maintained by FUJIFILM's subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as unaffiliated third party sites. As more fully described below, each of these sites may be governed by a different privacy policy or statement. We suggest you check the privacy link typically located in the footer of each web page to access and review the applicable privacy policy or statement. Since privacy policies or statements may change periodically, we also suggest that you occasionally re-visit them.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us at [InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com](mailto:InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com) if you have any questions about our privacy practices, your personal data, rights, or choices.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 25, 2018.

**The Information We Collect.** The information we collect from visitors to FUJIFILM's site helps us improve our site and provide better service to you. We collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store personal data (such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone, and fax numbers) when needed to provide our services and for our operational and business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. Occasionally you may choose to provide and we collect from you and process what may be considered sensitive personal data (collectively, "personal data") such as driver's license information and financial and bank account numbers, including credit card numbers.

We want to be clear about our privacy practices so that you can make informed choices about the use of your information, and we encourage you to contact us at [InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com](mailto:InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com) at any time with questions or concerns.

The information we collect falls into two broad categories: (1) information you voluntarily provide to us and (2) information that is automatically collected.

_**Information you voluntarily provide to us.**_ Generally, you can visit FUJIFILM’s site without providing any personal or sensitive personal data. However, on some pages, we collect personal data in order to provide a service or carry out a transaction requested by you. See below for what personal data is collected and how it is used. We may also ask for feedback relating to our goods or services. Participation is voluntary and you are not required to provide this information. There generally is no negative effect on you if you choose not to provide your personal data. However, since personal data may be needed to process an order, if you choose not to participate, we may not be able to perform a requested service or complete a transaction.

_**Information Collected Automatically.**_ Our servers, logs and other technologies collect and store certain personal and non-personal data such as your device ID, IP address, machine operating system, geolocations, type of system, and selection preferences that is generated automatically as you navigate through our sites. We use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" used to store and manage user preferences, deliver targeted advertising, enable content, and gather analytic and usage data, for example. The use of cookies and other tracking technologies is standard across websites and apps through which information is collected about your online activities across applications, website, or other servicers. You can choose to accept or decline cookies and, while most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our sites.

  * **What is a cookie?** A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a computer or other device and is used to identify the user or device and to collect information. Cookies help to track user trends and patterns and also relieve users from having to re-enter their preferences on certain areas of the site where they have previously entered preference information. The cookie types we use to collect personal data and non-personal data include the following attributes: session cookies, persistent cookies, third-party cookies.
  * **What is a web beacon?** A web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel that is placed on a website or in an email that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email. It is often used in combination with cookies. We use web beacons to access cookies and to count users who visit our site or open email messages. We collect this information to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site. We sometimes use the non-identifying and aggregate information that is collected as described above to enhance the design of our site and help us understand the needs of our visitors.



**How We Use Your Information.** We process personal data for these service- and business-related purposes:

We may also use personal data to meet our internal and external audit requirements, information security purposes, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, which may include laws outside your country of residence; (b) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence; (c) to enforce terms and conditions; and (d) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.

**When We Share Personal Data.** FUJIFILM will not provide personal data to any third party or use the information for an undisclosed purpose except as otherwise noted at the point where the information is collected and where necessary to provide services or conduct our business operations as described below. We only share personal data in accordance with data privacy and security requirements, and we occasionally will share non-personal, anonymized, and statistical data with third parties. We make appropriate efforts to ensure that the entities we share personal data with do not further distribute the information such as entering into non-disclosure agreements.

  * **Within FUJIFILM globally:** FUJIFILM is a global operation with offices and locations around the world, and FUJIFILM is supported by a variety of global teams and functions. Personal data may be shared with affiliates of FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation worldwide that are not considered direct subsidiaries under this Privacy Policy if needed to provide services or fulfill product orders, for account administration, to facilitate sales and marketing, for customer and technical support, and to promote business and product development.

FUJIFILM will share personal data with local distributors in relative regions.
  * **With our business partners.** We occasionally partner with other organizations to deliver co-branded services and products, or to host events, conferences and seminars. We and our business partners may collect and share personal data. FUJIFILM will handle personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of our business partners to learn more about how they collect, use, and share personal data.
  * **With third-party service providers.** We have third-party service providers around the world. Personal data will be made available to these parties only when necessary to fulfill the services they provide to us such as software, system, and platform support; direct marketing services; cloud hosting services; advertising; data analytics; and order fulfillment and delivery. Our third-party service providers are not permitted to share or use personal data we make available to them for any other purpose than to fulfill its obligations to FUJIFILM.
    * **Links to Third-Party Sites.** Our site may contain links to third-party sites that are not under the control of or maintained by FUJIFILM or our subsidiaries or affiliates. While we try to only link to sites that share our standards and privacy concerns, FUJIFILM does not control and we are not responsible for the content, security, privacy policies or the operation of third party sites. Further, if you opt to engage in transactions on third party sites linked to this site, such as purchases or promotions, we are not responsible and you must deal with the third party operators of such sites if any issues arise. As mentioned above, when visiting any site we suggest that you routinely review the applicable privacy policy or statement and other posted terms and conditions to understand your rights and options.

  * **With third parties for legal reasons.** We will share personal data when we believe we are legally required to, such as:
    * Under applicable law or by legal process such as a court order.
    * To prevent physical harm or property damage, and to protect our rights, users, systems and services.
    * As part of an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful conduct.
    * To comply with and respond to requests from government agencies, including law enforcement and other public authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence.
    * In the event of a merger, sale, restructure, acquisition, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).



**How we store and process personal data.** FUJIFILM is a global organization and has networks, databases, servers, systems, support, help desks, third-party cloud hosting services, suppliers and technology support in locations throughout the world in order to service the needs of our business, workforce, and customers, all of which support FUJIFILM. We take appropriate steps to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed, secured, and transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and requirements of applicable laws and regulations, including where personal data is processed and stored, which may be in a location outside your country of residence. FUJIFILM may transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA, including to countries in which a level of data protection is not comparable to the level that applies in the EEA. However, when such transfer occurs it is based on a legal justification and means of transferring, for example, pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses.

**How we secure personal data.** FUJIFILM takes the security of personal data it collects and retains seriously. We are committed to safeguarding it and protecting against unauthorized access to, or use of, our information assets and any other anticipated threats or hazard to the security and integrity of such assets. Measures we take to safeguard personal data include appropriate policies and procedures to address risk management, appropriate restrictions on access to personal data; monitoring and physical measures for the secure storage and transfer of personal data; training for employees and contractors with access to personal data; and vendor risk management requiring contractual obligations to protect any personal data with which they are entrusted in accordance with our security policies and procedures. For more information on FUJIFILM’s information security program, please click here <http://www.fujifilmusa.com/cybersecurity/index.html>.

**How long we keep personal data.** FUJIFILM has policies and procedures relating to the retention of personal data based upon a classification scheme consisting of business functions and process areas, and the classification and types of the data and records. We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for business and legal purposes. In determining data retention periods, FUJIFILM considers contractual and legal obligations, and the expectations and requirements of customers, vendors, suppliers and others who share their personal data with us. When we no longer need personal data, we securely delete or destroy it.

**Your right to access, correct, or delete your personal data.** We respect your right to access and control your personal data, and we will endeavor to respond to requests for information about personal data and, where applicable will correct, amend, or delete your personal data.

  * **Access to personal data:** We will comply with requests for access to your personal data, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you reasonable access to any of your personal data we maintain within 30 days of your access request. If we cannot honor your request within the 30-day period, we will inform you when we will be able to provide access. In the unlikely event that we cannot provide you access to this information, we will explain why we cannot do so. We will ask for proof of your identity in order to confirm your identity and that you are seeking access to personal data belonging to you, and also sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).
  * **Correction to and deletion of personal data:** In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal data if it is inaccurate or requires updating, and also the right to request deletion of your personal data. Due to legal requirements and other obligations and factors, this is not always possible. Remember that account information may be corrected, deleted, or updated by using the “Contact Us” option within the relevant service. For inquiries of this nature, please contact us at [InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com](mailto:InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com).
  * **Opting out:** To opt out of marketing email, you can use the unsubscribe link found in the email communication you receive from us. You may also use the “Contact Us” option within the relevant service to opt out and elect not to receive further emails from us.
  * **Choices:** Some personal data is necessary in order to provide certain services. However, you may choose to limit FUJIFILM's use of your personal data by adjusting your browser settings, opting out, or you may contact us at [InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com](mailto:InfoSec-NA@fujifilm.com) for more information regarding your choices. Since personal data may be needed to process an order, if you choose not to participate, we may not be able to perform a requested service or complete a transaction.



**Filing a Complaint.** EU residents have the right to make a complaint to a data protection regulator in the event of dissatisfaction with how FUJIFILM manages their personal data. A list of National Data Protection Authorities can be found here: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>.

**Our Special Commitment to Children’s Privacy.** Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. This website is not intended for anyone under the age of 16. If you are younger than 16, you may not use this website.

**Do Not Track.** "Do Not Track" is a privacy preference that you can set in your Internet search browser that sends a signal to a website that you do not want the website operator to track certain browsing information about you. However, because our site is not configured to detect Do Not Track signals from a user’s computer, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track requests at this time.

If we do decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on this site.
