### 3.2 Legal Requirements

Funambol may disclose Personal Data, including, without limitation to, PIM Data and Rich Media Data - if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, if required by law, or, at its sole discretion, if Funambol deems it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of the Terms of Use Agreement or the rights of Funambol or any third party.

### 3.3 Security

Funambol uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
