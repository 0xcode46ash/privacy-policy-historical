This is the privacy policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") that governs how we, Fundbox Ltd. (" **Fundbox** ", " **we** ", " **our** " or " **us** "), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of: (i) the website [fundbox.com](http://fundbox.com/), and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a " **Site** "); and (ii) the Fundbox cash-flow optimization™, capital funding and invoice clearing™ service (" **Service** "). The Site and the Service are individually and collectively referred to herein as the " **Services** ". 

  
**1.** **Introduction.** We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. " **Personal Information** " means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.

**2.** **Terms of Use.** This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use which is available at [https://fundbox.com/tou/](https://fundbox.com/tou) (" **Terms** "). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to in the Terms.

**3.** **Consent and Modification.** By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.

**4.** **What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.** **** We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:

4.1. _Account_. In order to participate in the Service, you are required to create an account (" **Account** "). We may offer different options to create an Account, including: 

(a) _Online Registration Form_ : You may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with a business email address and a password that you will use for your Account. 

(b) _Third Party Accounts_ : You may choose to create (or supplement) an Account by clicking on a 'connect' or 'sign on' button that we may display on the Site for a designated account that you have with a third party website or service (each a " **Third Party Account** "), such as Intuit's QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Xero, or another third party e-invoicing or accounting software product that is designated on our Site. Doing so will enable you to link your Fundbox Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then we will obtain certain information, including Personal Information, from your Third Party Account. The information that we obtain from your Third Party Account is information that you have chosen to make available to us as part of your use of your Third Party Account, and is typically identified in the privacy policy of your Third Party Account provider. You acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of the provider of your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account. 

Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address, or to the email address that you have designated in your Third Party Account, to instruct you how to confirm your registration. 

4.2. _Business Information_. If you wish to use the Service to clear an invoice then you may be required to provide us with certain information about your business and business personnel (" **Business Information** ").

Please be aware though that any failure to provide requested information may preclude your business from being approved to obtain an Advance from us.

4.3. _Purchases_. The Service may include the option to purchase certain products or services from us (for example, to obtain an Advance).

We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments.
