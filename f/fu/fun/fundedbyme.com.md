# Funded By Me - Fund your project through social networks

* * *

We respect your right to privacy.

We will not give your name or personal information to third parties.

PayPal processes all of the transactions on Funded By Me. No one sees your credit card information besides PayPal, not even us.

* * *

### Email

We will communicate with you only if your want to hear from us. We will send you information or present projects that we think are great. See this as our effort to spread good ideas. Someday it might be your turn. But we will keep these emails to a minimum.

* * *

### Technology / Security

FundedByMe uses _cookies_ to help (anonymously) recognize you as a repeat visitor and to track traffic patterns on our site. We use this information to make FundedByMe more user-friendly.

We track users only through Google Analytics. No ip addresses are stored at this point. We might do it at a later stage if we detect fraud or hacking.

Your personal information is stored safely behind firewalls and is only accessible by a limited number of staff people. Payments are made through Paypal, one of the worlds safest methods.

Regardless of these efforts by us, no data transmission over the public Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### Voluntary Disclosure

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues.

* * *

### Project Creators

By entering into our User Agreement, FundedByMe Project Creators agree to not abuse other users' personal information. Funded By Me Project Creators or Funded By Me staff never receive users' credit card information. Paypal are the ones handling this and the only ones seeing this.

People under 18 are not permitted to use FundedByMe on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of the site.
