**Privacy Policy**

We are committed to maintain your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintain the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online. 

**Basic Confidentiality Policy**

It is our policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address , is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to your request ). For example, when you send a file or a joke you want as to publish, the personal information you provide will be used only to reply to you and to give credits.

**No Release of Information to Third Parties**

Personal information will not be released to third parties Our computer does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by Smiles technical support staff. Our computer also recognizes the site where a visitor "clicked-to-check" on Smiles, but we cannot identify the visitor or the visitor's address. No personal information is collected. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
