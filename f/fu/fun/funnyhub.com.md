# Funny Hub - Privacy Policy

Funny Hub and our network of websites respects your privacy and does not collect any personal information that is not submitted by the user (such as signing up for our mailing list or sending a page to a friend). In the event that we do obtain your e-mail address, it will only be used for our newsletter and will **not** be distributed to any third-party or subjected to commercial e-mail. We have also taken precautions to ensure that our e-mail lists are not illegally obtained by an outside party, although we cannot guarantee that this isn't at least a possibility.

Funny Hub's websites do distribute cookies on your personal computer, but they do not collect any personally identifiable information (a.k.a. spyware). The purpose of these cookies is merely to prevent visitors from rating the same page of content more than once, so the scoring is fair and cannot be unfairly manipulated by a single user.

The advertisements on Funny Hub and our network of sites* are provided by both direct advertisers and third-party ad networks, including [Fastclick.com](http://www.fastclick.com/re.f?17857), [Google](http://www.google.com/), and [Right Media](http://www.rightmedia.com/). These ads often distribute cookies for the purpose of frequency capping and optimization, which we consider to be a legitimate use of technology. To learn more, you will need to visit each respective company's website.

Although Funny Hub makes a serious effort to prevent ads that contain spyware, adware, or other malicious programs (such as drive-by-downloads) we cannot always guarantee their exclusion.

FunnyHub.com and its network of sites are owned and operated by [805 Media](http://www.805m.com/). If you have any privacy concerns, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403160105id_/http%3A//www.funnyhub.com/contact.html).
