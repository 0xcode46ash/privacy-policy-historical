# Funny Hub - Privacy Policy

FunnyHub.com respects your privacy and does not collect any personal information that is not submitted by the user (such as signing up for our mailing list or sending a page to a friend). In the event that we do obtain your e-mail address via submission, it will only be used for our newsletter (or for an invitation to subscribe to our newsletter) and will **not** be distributed to any third-party or subjected to commercial e-mail. The only way you will ever be subscribed to our newsletter is if you specifically verify the subscription by clicking a confirmation link in a verification e-mail. If you receive any other type of mail from a funnyhub.com address, specifically SPAM, these messages are forged and were not actually sent by FunnyHub.com.

We have also taken precautions to ensure that our e-mail lists are not illegally obtained by an outside party, although we cannot guarantee that this isn't at least a possibility.

The FunnyHub.com website may distribute cookies on your personal computer, but they do not collect any personally identifiable information (a.k.a. spyware). The purpose of these cookies is merely to prevent visitors from rating the same page of content more than once, so the scoring is fair and cannot be unfairly manipulated by a single user.

The advertisements on FunnyHub.com are provided by both direct advertisers and third-party ad networks, including [Fastclick.com](http://www.fastclick.com/re.f?17857), [Tribal Fusion](http://www.tribalfusion.com/), [Casale Media](http://www.casalemedia.com/) and [Buds Inc](http://www.budsinc.com/). These ads often distribute cookies for the purpose of frequency capping and optimization, which we consider to be a legitimate use of technology. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. To learn more, you will need to visit each respective company's website.

While FunnyHub.com will make every effort to prevent ads that contain spyware, adware, or other malicious programs (such as drive-by-downloads) we cannot always guarantee their exclusion due to the third-party nature of online advertising.

If you have any privacy concerns, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20051218031050id_/http%3A//funnyhub.com/contact.html).
