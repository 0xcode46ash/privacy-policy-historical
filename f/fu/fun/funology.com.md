We want kids to have a good time at Funology.com, learn things, and be safe. We ask for their e-mail addresses to send them information that they request. But we respect our visitors' privacy. This is why we promise: 

\- We will never publish last names, addresses, phone numbers, or any other information that identifies you. If you send this information to Funology as part of a message, we will delete it before we post the message on the site. 

\- If you prefer that your messages not be posted on the site or published in any print materials--and you tell us so--we will honor your request. We will even delete those messages from our files. (Contact us by e-mail should you ever want us to delete a message.) 

\- Our Web server automatically collects your domain name and keeps track of the pages that you access or visit. But this information is never connected with your name. 

\- We may conduct surveys from time to time. We will share the information with our partners and sponsors, but only in aggregate form—for example, the number of boys or girls of a certain age who visit the site—and we will not identify anyone by their full name. 

We do not request any credit card or other financial information. While we screen our partners carefully, we are not responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.

The lead in pencils, really graphite, is made of the exact same thing as diamonds. Both are pure carbon which just formed under different pressures and temperatures. Intense heat and pressure form the carbon atoms into crystals making diamond, while lesser heat and pressure form the carbon into sheets making graphite.
