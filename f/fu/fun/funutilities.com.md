## Information Collection

Visiting and using Crawler Services may result in Crawler receiving performance and usage information (such as search term, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous identifier). This information will not be used to personally identify you.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Some of Crawler services require registration in order to create an account. The registration information typically asked for includes your name, email address and account password. This information is necessary to initiate as well as continually use the account. Searches using alternate search engines such as MSN, Google, and Yahoo through the Crawler toolbar are relayed through our servers, however, we don't collect any search specific or user related information.

## Cookies

Cookies are small files that contain information that a website uses to store user preferences and settings. You can reset your browser to control cookies; however, some Crawler services may not function properly if cookies are refused. Searches using alternate search engines such as MSN, Google, and Yahoo through the Crawler toolbar are relayed through our servers, however, we don't collect any search specific or user related information.

## Sharing of Information

Crawler does not collect any personally identifiable information unless provided by you, and we will not share, rent or sell any of your personally identifiable information provided by you. We may share aggregated non-personally identifiable information with third parties outside of Crawler. Aggregate non-personally identifiable information is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user. We may disclose some information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements.

## Policy Changes

Crawler may change this Privacy Policy at any time at its sole discretion. Notice of material changes to this Policy will be posted on Crawler's Website. We will not reduce your rights under our Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most future changes to be minor.
