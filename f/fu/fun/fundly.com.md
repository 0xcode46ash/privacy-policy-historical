# Privacy Policy for Fundly

September 23, 2010

Fundly's Privacy Policy (this "Policy") covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Fundly anytime you interact with Fundly, such as when you visit our website, when you use Fundly services, or when you call our sales or support team. 

**Personal Information** The only personal information we collect is information that you provide. "Personal information," as used in this Policy, means information that is directly associated with a particular person, such as name, address, telephone number and email address. We may request personal information in order to provide various types of services or information to you. For example, personal information may be requested in connection with your affirmative request to receive email or other communications from us, or a contribution made to a Fundly client.

Our general policy is to not make personal information provided online available to anyone other than our employees, staff and agents, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. 

Third parties providing services to us may have limited access to your personal information.  Access to your personal information by these service providers is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for them to perform their limited function for us.  We require these service providers to protect the privacy of your personal information in a manner consistent with this Policy, and to not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing the service to us.

We may release personal information to third parties to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order.  For example, federal and state election laws requires us to collect your name, street address, occupation and employer in connection with certain political contributions.  Additionally, we may disclose personal information where we believe doing so is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse or illegal conduct, or to protect the safety and security of visitors to client websites.

The security of your personal information is important to us.  We maintain a variety of physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to protect personal information you provide to us.  For example, we have adopted commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems.  We use a secured/encrypted server for online credit card contributions. 

**Changes to this Online Privacy Policy** We reserve the right to revise or update this Policy at any time.  If we make any changes to this Policy, we will post the updated Policy and will update the date at the top of the page.
