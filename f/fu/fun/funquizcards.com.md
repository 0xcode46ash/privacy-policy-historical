# Privacy Policy

We respect the privacy of our visitors and surfers. We do not sell or barter email addresses you give us when you register or when you send a quiz.

The only information we store is the data which you enter while registering on our website. We do not share this data with anyone else. We reserve the right to use this data to display advertisements or show offers to you which you may be interested in. This we may do in association with third party advertisers. But we give the users the option to pass/skip these advertising offers. If you submit any data in a third party form of any advertiser, please do so only after reading their privacy policy. In any case, we associate ourselves with the best advertisers for the benefit of our users. 

**Limitations on privacy:**  
We reserve the right to provide information if we think - correctly or incorrectly and reasonably or unreasonably - that our quizzes, polls and ecards, are being used in violation of our terms of use, including, but not limited to, being used in any illegal, harmful, threatening or anti-social activity. 

We try to protect your privacy, but you must please understand that any use of the Internet or of email creates the possibility that someone could access the data transmitted. There is always some risk on the web that personal information might be accessed and privacy cannot be guaranteed.
