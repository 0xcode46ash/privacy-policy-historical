To register with FUNimation, children will be asked to input their name, age, address, and email. FUNimation does not knowingly collect any information about children under 13 without parental consent. FUNimation will use the information to register the child with our site.

Parents are free at anytime to change or remove their child's information from the site by logging onto the web site for which their child registered and under the Update Profile section, click to Unsubscribe, which thereby revokes the parent's consent to have the child interact with FUNimation. If a parent revokes their consent for a child to participate in chat room, contest, forum, game, or other such activity, and requests that the information collected on their child to be deleted, then FUNimation has the right to block that child from participating in any chat room, contest, game, or other such activity.
