**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**  
In order to fulfill licensing transactions or provide service to you as a customer of FunEducation, we may require you to provide certain information to us. Common items may include, but are not limited to, your name, address, phone number and credit card number.  By providing this information, you are agreeing to allow us to utilize this information to complete all transactions you request through this Site and to disclose that information and details of all such transactions to our subsidiaries, affiliates or necessary payment processors.

Here is an explanation of the information we gather and how it is used:

**REGISTRATION**  
The Site's registration form gathers contact information (e.g., your name and address), unique identifiers (e.g., your e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g., your zip code). We use contact information from the registration form to send you important updates about new features on the Site and special offers from our affiliates. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you if we have a question about your registration.  You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out Policy below.  Demographic and profile data is also collected at our Site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information is shared with our affiliates on an aggregate basis.

**ORDER**  
The Site uses an order form to request products and services. We collect contact information (e.g., your shipping address), unique identifiers (e.g., your name and telephone number), financial information (e.g., your credit card number), and demographic information (e.g., your zip code). Contact information from the order form is used to process orders and is also used to get in touch with you if there is a question about your order. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out Policy below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services. Unique identifiers (e.g., your billing address) are collected to verify your identity and protect against fraud.  We keep a purchase history for each user, tracking all purchases made on the Site.  We use this information to provide a high level of customer service, help you track your orders and offer personalized products and content that we think you would find helpful. Demographic and profile data is also collected during the checkout process. 

**CONTESTS AND SURVEYS**  
We run contests and conduct surveys on our Site where we will obtain contact information (e.g.  your email address) and demographic information (e.g.  your zip code). We use contact data from our contests and surveys to send visitors information about our company, to notify winners and award prizes, and to monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of this Site. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out Policy below. 

**SPECIAL OFFERS**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications; see the Opt-Out Policy below.

**COOKIES AND LOG FILES**  
A cookie is a data file that your browser places on your computer's hard drive when you visit some Web sites. A cookie cannot be used to find out your identity, gather information from your computer or read cookie files created by other Web sites.  Cookies allow us to create an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience for you.  Using cookies, we are able to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**AGGREGATE INFORMATION**  
We share demographic data, sales, traffic patterns and related site information with our affiliates and other reputable third parties in aggregate form only. The shared aggregate data does not include any personal information.

**TELL A FRIEND**  
If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we will ask you for the friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site.  We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  We do not store, rent, sell or trade these e-mail addresses.

**SECURITY PROCEDURES**  
This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored in a secure database behind a firewall designed to prevent unauthorized access and none of the information can be retrieved via the Internet.

To provide you with an additional layer of security, all credit card numbers are stored on a computer that is not connected to the Internet.  After you type in your credit card number, it is transferred to our secure computer.  This computer is not accessible by network or modem and your credit card number is not stored anywhere else except for normal back-ups. In addition, all credit card numbers stored in the secure computer are encrypted as an added security measure. 

**OPT-OUT POLICY**  
Our Site gives users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications from FunEducation.  You can opt-out of receiving non-essential communications from us at any time by emailing us at [support@funeducation.com](mailto:support@funeducation.com).   In addition, whenever we send you a non-essential email communication, you can opt-out of similar future mailings by simply clicking on a link provided in the e-mail message.

If at any time you believe that we have not followed the this Privacy Policy, you have any questions about this policy, or if you would like your information to be removed from our system, please contact us at [support@funeducation.com](mailto:support@funeducation.com).  We will make reasonable efforts to identify and correct any reported problems.
