## Your online information:

We use several aspects of your online “footprints,” such as your IP address and cookies, in order to engage in general administering of the product and web site, as well as tracking and monitoring of information gathered about patterns of interest and behaviour; including frequency of visits, popularity of applications, and to estimate the population size of our users. This information, along with your specific requests, is what gives us insight into the fine-tuning and updates that the Function Point web site may require in order to make each visit more enjoyable. No such information that we collect is used for any purposes other than customizing and personalizing your experience with Function Point, nor does any of it get passed on to a third party for any other purpose; we do not analyze demographics.

## User Information:

As you know, your information is essential in order for us to provide, and for you to enjoy, the many services Function Point has to offer. Once you register for a Function Point account you become an integral part of our system, as it is with all. Your personal user information is kept safe in the system record registry and is only used for managing your log in abilities, to contact you if necessary, and for us to simply know who you are so we can better service you. We encourage you to let us know if you have any problems logging into your Function Point account, and if you wish to change any of your login information you may do so via the “Password” option on your dashboard.

## Preventative Measures:

Your Function Point password is meant strictly for you to know, and we recommend that you do not impart it to anyone. Upon necessity, a Function Point support agent will access your account only with your consent or specific request. Especially if you share a computer, or have used your Function Point account in a public place, we urge you to remember to sign off and close your browser before leaving the station. This is imperative to the safety of your privacy. We wish to remind you that transmission of information over the internet is never 100% safe, but also that we use the latest technology in internet security to safeguard your data as best we can.   
It is always recommended that you use the SSL log in option when signing onto Function Point.

Once again, if you have any concerns regarding this policy or any questions concerning your account information, we encourage you to contact us by any means.
