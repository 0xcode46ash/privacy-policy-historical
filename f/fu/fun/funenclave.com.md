### Publication Date: May01, 2006

FunEnclave has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site:  
**www.FunEnclave.com**

**What constitutes FunEnclave.com**  
For all purposes, FunEnclave.com refers to the domain www.funenclave.com and all of its directories and sub domains. This privacy policy is applicable at all such areas that fall under the domain of "funenclave.com". Individual sections of this website might be covered separately as an add-on to this privacy policy.

**Right to Change Policy**  
As FunEnclave.com is constantly innovating and enhancing the type of services it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to change to match the services and features we make available. As such, we reserve the right to change this statement to match the services we provide. If we make any material change to this statement, we will change the date at the top of this statement to reflect the effective date of the change. When you visit our site or use our services and site features, we encourage you to check the date of this Privacy Statement to ensure you are aware of any updates. However, regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over time, FunEnclave will not collect or maintain your private and personally identifiable information without your consent. Further, if you consent to give us your personal information, we will keep it confidential and will not sell, license or disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent in any manner that personally identifies you, unless we are compelled to do so under the law or to comply with court order. 

**Types of Information We Collect**  
A user can browse this website at two levels. The information gathering policies of FunEnclave.com depend on the level at which you browse.

  * As a guest, without registering on the site, you are free to browse FunEnclave.com without submitting any personal information as a guest where personal information refers to your name, email address, your address, phone number or any such information that directly identifies you. However, all your activities on this website will be logged in a non-personally identifiable manner for statistical purposes by our software and/or third party software applications. This information helps us to understand browsing habits of our users and is used to plan our future strategies vis-a-vis content we put on this website.
  * As a registered member, you are required to provide this website at a bare minimum, your email address which is used for activating your account and/or for future communication with you. You will also be required to provide us with a password and select a nickname that will identify you on this site and is used to log you into this website and allows you to browse as a registered member. FunEnclave.com does not ask for any other information at the time of registration that personally identifies you. However, you as a user might chose to provide us any other information _voluntarily_ both at the time of registration and subsequently while browsing the website.



**Voluntary information that FunEnclave.com requests  
**When you register, you are asked to give demographic information (like birth year, occupation, and gender). We ask you to tell us a little about yourself so we can better understand the types of people who register. This information can also be used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you, and to show you advertisements that are relevant to your demographic information. FunEnclave.com uses third party ad companies to display ads on its sites. These ads may contain cookies. While FunEnclave.com uses cookies in other parts of its sites, the ad companies also use cookies with the ads displayed, and FunEnclave.com may not have access to the type of information they log.

**Information Automatically Logged**  
As and when you visit this website, your IP address is automatically logged. We will also log via third part software your browsing trends which are used solely for understanding user demands and planning our future strategy such as the type of content we should make available for you in future. As such the information logged when you browse as guest is not personally identifiable. As a registered member, the information may or may not be associated with your web identity (which you provided this website when you chose to register on this website). However, even in this case we never use such information to study individual trends but to use a collection of data obtained for a multitude of users for statistical purposes.

**Children's Online Privacy**  
While this website is open for all to browse and register, we expect and state at the time of sign up that children below the age of 13 will obtain their guardian's permission before browsing this website and/or trying to register. However this website does not make any warranty or claim of protecting the privacy of children in any other particular way.

**Password Encryption**  
Please note that registration in our message boards require that you specify a password for your use. This password is then encrypted by the underlying software automatically, which means that the neither the staff nor any other member of FunEnclave has access or knowledge of what your exact password is. This gives you ample security in case you are using the same password repeatedly in other sites (which is strongly discouraged). As and when you request for a new password, you will be asked for your old password. If you have forgotten your old password you can chose to generate a new one, in which case the underlying software will generate a new password arbitrarily (note your old password will not be recovered in its exact form even by this method) and will automatically send you the same via a email to the email address you had provided this website at the time of signing up.
