# FutureAdvisor: Your online investment advisor

FutureAdvisor, owned by Xulu, Inc. (“Xulu” or “Company”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the www.futureadvisor.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Xulu in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## What does this privacy policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers FutureAdvisor’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that FutureAdvisor gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use FutureAdvisor services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that FutureAdvisor does not own or control, or to individuals that FutureAdvisor does not employ or manage. 

## What personal information does FutureAdvisor collect?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers: 

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:**   
We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name; username; email address; address; phone number; bank account, credit card and other financial information; IP address; and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes such as improving the content of the Website; providing you with administrative notices, money alerts and other communications relevant to your use of the Website; customizing content and any advertising you see; and communicating with you. 

1) Personal Information Collected Automatically: 

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. FutureAdvisor automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. FutureAdvisor only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, FutureAdvisor never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 



2) E-mail Communications: 

  * We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from FutureAdvisor if your computer supports this type of program. FutureAdvisor uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please send us an e-mail at help@futureadvisor.com, or by clicking “unsubscribe” in e-mails that you receive from us. 



3) What About Cookies? 

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and allow you to utilize the application within the same session without having to log in to each page, and are thus central to the operation of the website. 
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features. 
  * Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by FutureAdvisor and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 



## Will FutureAdvisor share any of the personal information it receives?

Moreover, if FutureAdvisor, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that FutureAdvisor goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of FutureAdvisor may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 

_Protection of FutureAdvisor and Others:_ We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of FutureAdvisor, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

_With Your Consent:_ Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
