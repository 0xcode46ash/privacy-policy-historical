**Your Personal Information**

Company is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, rent, or release this information, nor will we share it in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

 **External Links**

This site contains links to other Web sites. Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.

 **Address Information  
**

Our site uses an order form for you to request information, products and services. We collect your contact information, including, but not limited to, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and financial information. Collected information is used for the sole benefit of Company to send information to customers about orders, about our company, and to send promotional material. This information is also used for billing and to contact you when necessary.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experiences at our site, to show you content that we think you might be interested in, and to display the content according to your preferences. Customer information is considered to be an asset of Company, and as such may be transferred to another company as part of an acquisition of Company.

You may opt out of receiving mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

 **Surveys**

In our surveys we ask for contact information (typically an email address) and demographic information (for example, zip code, age, or income level). We use this information to send promotional material about Company products and services.

 **Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™ information when you send sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to us via our order form. That information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on such an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. At other times this lock appears open. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select "Properties".) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with https:// instead of http://.

 **Cookies and IP addresses**

The Company is committed to customer privacy. We use your IP address simply to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes such as to personalize the site. If you set your browser to reject cookies you will still be able to use the Company site; however, the site will not be able to recognize your cart, your account, or any personalization.

 **Opt-Outs**

It is Company's policy to keep Personal Information only for so long as needed for such purposes. Except for the Personal Information we need to complete your purchase of products, you may request at any time that Company dispose of any or all Personal Information about you. In addition, at any time you may request (i) that Company correct any such Personal Information; or (ii) that such Personal Information be removed from Company's marketing databases.
