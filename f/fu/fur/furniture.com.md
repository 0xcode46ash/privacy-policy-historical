At Furniture.com, we believe you're entitled to decide what information you share with us and how it is used, so we answer your questions about privacy up front!

We Respect Your Privacy

At Furniture.com, we respect your privacy and want you to understand how your information is used. 


Why does Furniture.com collect online visitor information?

The information we receive from you helps us to fulfill your order accurately and quickly, learn how to improve your shopping experience, as well as meet our commitment to privacy. When you visit Furniture.com, you have the option of creating a free Furniture.com account so you can place online orders, save your shopping cart items, gain access to special promotions, and view delivery details and lead times. Creating a Furniture.com account is easy. We just need your name, email address, zip code, and a password of your choice.

Once you place your online order, we'll ask for some additional information to fulfill the order including your delivery address, billing address, phone number, and credit card information. 

Your Consent   
  
We collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law. Your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal information in question. For example, in many cases, your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Furniture.com may be implied by the fact that you made a purchase on our website, where the collection, use and disclosure of personal information relates to the fulfillment of your order by Furniture.com. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we assume you have the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose their information as described in this policy. If you choose to provide personal information to Furniture.com (for example, registration for promotional emails), we assume that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this privacy statement. 

If you do not consent, please do not provide your personal information or, where applicable, exercise the opt-in or opt-out options offered. Subject to legal and contractual requirements and reasonable notice, you may refuse to consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information or you may withdraw your consent to our further collection, use and disclosure of information about you, by contacting our Customer Service team at at [customerservice@furniture.com](mailto:customerservice@furniture.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy) or calling us at [866-965-3876](tel:866-965-3876). Note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide certain of our services. 

There are instances where Furniture.com may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, for example, to collect a debt you owe to us, to comply with a subpoena or court order, or to comply with other valid process regarding the production of records.
