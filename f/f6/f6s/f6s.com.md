# Privacy policy | f6s

We have written this policy to explain how Cloud Speed Ltd trading as f6s ("we", "us" or "f6s") uses the data you give us through our site(s), including but not limited to f6s.com. 

By providing personal information you are deemed to consent to your personal information being shared outside f6s in the following circumstances: 

  * where f6s needs to share your information to provide the service you have requested. 
  * where f6s needs to send the information to third parties who work on behalf of f6s to provide a service to you. We will only provide the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 
  * where f6s wants to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, updates or other f6s information 
  * where you have given us permission to share your information with third parties 
  * f6s will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our website. 



f6s offers social networking features so you can interact with our partners and with other people using f6s. The default setting for your profile will be to share your name, profile photo, affiliations, key events, profile descriptions, public information from an external service you have provided and key contacts publicly. Content on any private discussion board will only be available to leaders, members and mentors of that group, unless you indicate otherwise. Additionally, if you choose to make anonymized information regarding you available to a third party by expressly indicating your preference on the site, we will make such information available. You can revoke access to your profile or remove the ability to message you (as applicable) at any time by using the relevant features to leave a specific group, leave a specific company, hide your profile or retract a mentor/similar relationship. Regardless of the default setting, we will provide you with a setting to disable your profile on f6s. Please note that your information may still be accessible on search engines for a number of days after you have disabled your profile on f6s. Additionally, it is important to remember the people you share with can always share your information with others and if you do actions on f6s like making an application, getting a deal or using Instant Apply, the data you provide may be shared with third parties as required to fulfil your request. Also consider that if you choose to enable f6s to publish on your behalf to a third party, anything published will be subject to that third party's privacy policy. We require third parties to respect your privacy, and your agreement with a third party will control how your information is used, stored, and transferred by the third party. 

There are two types of information in general on f6s.  
One type is the basic information displayed on your company/team/program/individual profile on f6s, such as name, company, sector, descriptions, mentors, team members and that you have applied to a program, which is generally visible, may be search indexed and displayed on external sites by authorized program and/or company members. 

You may block such use of your basic information at any time by making your profile hidden. Information you provide directly on an application to a program on f6s is not basic information. f6s only makes non- basic information that you provide on your application available to the program administrators and their designated evaluators and any programs you choose to transfer your application to using Instant Apply. This policy applies each time you submit data to the site(s). Your use of the site(s) means that you agree that we may use that data in accordance with this policy. Our privacy policy will change from time to time. The up to date privacy policy will always be shown on this page.
