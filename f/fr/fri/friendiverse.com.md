| ****Frien _diverse_** Privacy Policy - Revised 03/15/2007**  
---  
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We will not sell, lease, or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent.  
This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact us.  
**Frien _diverse_** is an online social networking community that connects people through their personal networks and allows them to meet others, find jobs, roommates, buy and sell goods, and perform other transactions. Members create their own profiles, and those profiles are then shown to other members and non-members of this site.  
**Frien _diverse_** collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, location, age, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: sign up as a member; make changes to their member profile information; and send e-mail messages. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their other profile sections. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network.   
Like many other Web sites, **Frien _diverse_** uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive - not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use **Frien _diverse_**. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use **Frien _diverse_**.   
Because we do not ask for your name at the time you join, members will only see and know your username. Email addresses of **Frien _diverse_** members are never displayed to other users on the system. Users within a Personal Network communicate on **Frien _diverse_** with each other through the **Frien _diverse_** service without disclosing their email addresses.  
We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your membership.   
If you use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our service, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We'll automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join your Personal Network. **Frien _diverse_** does not sell these email addresses or use them to transmit any communication other than the invitation to join your personal Network. **Frien _diverse_** stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation and reminders, and for tracking the success of our Invite functionality.  
The **Frien _diverse_** site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that **Frien _diverse_** is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. Please also note that our other affiliated site, Premaroo.Com has its own Privacy Policy on that site. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than **Frien _diverse_** , different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties.   
Your password is encrypted within our system. Our staff has no way to access your password. If you forget it, it can be emailed to you through the system, but nobody can manually tell you your password. Do not ever accept requests for passwords from anyone. Our staff will never ask you for your password. In the event that you need technical support that would typically require us to ask for a password, we have state of the art technology that will allow us to enter your account with an administrator override function. This is not used to invade your privacy, but rather as a technical support tool for which we will make you aware if we must use for support reasons. Aside from using this technology for support, we reserve the legal right to enter any account for matters relating to security, at the request of law enforcement whether or not supported by a court issued warrant, or other reasonable purpose at our designation. Access by staff is extremely limited and restricted under our own internal strict company policies regarding the use of this technology.  
Our site is monitored continuously for security reasons, development reasons, etc. not just for members, but for guests as well. As with all websites, we are able to obtain the IP address from which you sign up and login from, as well as what paths you follow on the site. This information is typically general, NOT specific, (i.e. we can tell how many people are visiting polls, how many messages are sent each day, how many new friend requests are generated, how many new members sign up, how many new blogs were created, etc.) and assists us in determining the most popular and least popular areas of the site so we can act accordingly based on that data, helps us track errors you encounter along the way which will often lead to a fix in place before you have to inform us, etc.   
Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, file uploads, events, and classifieds - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.  
Our Privacy Policy is considered an attachment to our Terms & Conditions and you accept and understand this by proceeding with use of our site.
