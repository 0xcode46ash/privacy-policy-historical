Your privacy is important to us.  This Privacy Statement describes the types of information Frigidaire collects from and about you when you use our websites or mobile apps, or call our Customer Engagement Center (the “Service.”).  This Privacy Statement also explains how Frigidaire may use and disclose information collected, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it.

**INFORMATION COLLECTION**

  * **Information You Provide to Us**



Frigidaire collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us.  This may include when you to request information from us, purchase or register a product, submit a rebate form, create an account with us, sign up for newsletters or our email lists, use our Service, submit a rating or review, participate in a survey or promotion, or otherwise contact us.

You may be required to provide certain personal information to create your Frigidaire account.  The personal information we collect may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, geolocation information, mobile device identifier and, if you are a Frigidaire customer, credit/debit card number or other financial information.  We may also collect non-personal information from you such as product serial and model numbers or the location where you purchased the product.

  * **Information We Automatically Collect**



We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Service or interact with our emails and online, mobile, and advertisements.  For example, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you such as your browser type, operating system, software version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the domain name from which you accessed the Service.  We also may collect information about your use of the Service including the date and time you access the Service, the areas or pages of the Service that you visit, the amount of time you spend using the Service, the number of times you return, whether you open, forward or click-through emails and ads, and other Service usage data.

You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Service or take full advantage of all of our offerings.  Check the “Help” menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to adjust your tracking settings or cookie preferences.  Note that our system may not recognize some or all Do Not Track headers from browsers.  On your device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising settings to control whether you want to receive more relevant advertising.

  * **Information Collected From Other Sources**



If you use a third party login to create your account (such as Facebook Connect) or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party based on your registration and privacy settings with those third party services.  This information may include name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity. 

  * **Combination of Information**



We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including personal and non-personal information, and information collected through our websites, Apps, Smart Appliances, and offline, as well as information collected from third party sources to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our Service.

  * Respond to your inquiries, fulfill orders, process payments, prevent transactional fraud, provide services, and contact and communicate with you;
  * Develop new products or services;
  * Provide you with customized content, targeted offers, and advertising on the Service or on other sites or apps;
  * Contact you with information, newsletters and promotional materials from Frigidaire or on behalf of our partners and affiliates;

**INFORMATION SHARING**

Frigidaire may share the personal information we collect from and about you: (1) among Frigidaire brands, subsidiaries, affiliates and parent companies; (2) to our Service Providers, if the disclosure will enable them to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (3) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of the Frigidaire Terms and Conditions of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; (4) to respond to judicial process or provide information to law enforcement or regulatory agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and (5) as described to you at the point of collection.

Except as stated above, we will not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties.  Frigidaire may, however, share aggregate or anonymous, non-personal information with third parties for their marketing or analytics uses.

Frigidaire may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of our business.  If another entity acquires Frigidaire or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity.  In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against Frigidaire, such information may be considered an asset of Frigidaire and may be sold or transferred to third parties.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

**DATA SECURITY**

Frigidaire is committed to maintaining the security of the data you provide us and will take reasonable precautions to help protect your personal information. We have taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the information we collect from and about our customers and Service users. Because there is always some risk in transmitting information over the Internet, while we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures.
