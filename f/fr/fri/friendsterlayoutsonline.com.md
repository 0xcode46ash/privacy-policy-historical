Thank you for visiting our web site. This privacy policy tells you how we use personal information collected at this site. Please read this privacy policy before using the site or submitting any personal information. By using the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.

**Collection of Information**  
We collect personally identifiable information, like names and email addresses when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. The information you provide is used to fulfill your specific request. This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to e-mail you back. 

**Cookies and Tracking**  
We don't directly set cookies from Friendsterlayoutsonline.com, but we do run a number of scripts from providers such as Google, LayoutCMS, and Cbox. All of these set web browser cookies. Google in particular quietly collects a tremendous amount of data on your browsing habits, and Friendsterlayoutsonline participates in that data collection. If that bugs you, please drop me a line to let me know how you feel about this and I'll consider removing Google's service. We not distribute any of your personal information to third parties. We don't directly track your presence on this website. Your IP address is logged and we look at the server logs on occasion, but this is in an aggregate fashion for the purpose of determining why people come to Friendsterlayoutsonline.com. What I'm most interested in specifically are two things: The websites that link to Friendsterlayoutsonline.com and send traffic here, and what keywords people use to find Friendsterlayoutsonline.com via search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN.
