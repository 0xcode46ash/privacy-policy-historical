# Privacy policy • Online Dating UK • Friends Reunited Dating

At Friends Reunited Dating, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our users' personal information. This is a legal document that sets out how we handle data that identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with the Friends Reunited Dating [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231001939id_/http%3A//www.friendsreuniteddating.co.uk/newfriends.aspx?wci=terms), of which this Privacy Policy forms part.

##  1\. Emails from Friends Reunited Dating 

You are probably most interested in how we will use your email address to communicate with you, so here's our email promise, in plain English.

**Service Emails** \- The team at Friends Reunited Dating hate spam and will never ever send you unsolicited emails. But there are some emails that we will need to send you to provide you with a good Friends Reunited Dating service. These include notifications that you have a message from another Member, reminders about your membership expiring and guides on how to use the site. A full list of the types of emails you will receive to help you use the service most effectively (which we call Service Emails) are shown below:

  * Validation email – the email we use to verify your email address when you first register
  * Payment receipt – this is sent if you upgrade to Full Membership
  * Renewal notices – these remind you to renew your Full Membership
  * Automatic Full Membership renewal alerts – if you have selected automatic renewal of your Full Membership, we will alert you before this happens
  * Key service messages – if we need to notify you about changes to the service
  * New message notification and reminders – when you receive messages from other Members
  * Notes/profile and photo approval notification
  * Service suspension notices – if you break the house rules



**Weekly Dating Matches** \- As well as these Service Emails, you will also receive our Weekly Dating Matches and (if you have opted to receive them) our occasional newsletters. These emails genuinely help you make the most of the website and let you know when there’s new fun and interesting stuff to do. Here's a bit more about them... 

  * We automatically send you our Weekly Dating Matches Alert. It is an essential part of the Friends Reunited Dating service because it tells you when potential matches have joined the site. The good thing about this email is it lets you know when you should pop back to the site.
  * If at anytime you decide you don't want to receive the Weekly Dating Matches, all you need to do is uncheck the “Weekly Dating Matches” box in your email preferences. You’ll find this on the “My Settings” page which can be accessed from a link anywhere on the site titled “My details/profiles” once you’re logged in. Instructions on this can be found at the bottom of every Weekly Dating Match email.



**Newsletters** \- When registering, you are given the option to receive our occasional newsletter. We use this to notify you about new features on the site, ask your opinion, and tell you about services you might not be using yet. 

  * We only send a newsletter when there is something worthwhile to tell you about, so your inbox will never be overflowing with guff from us. Generally you»ll get a newsletter about once every six weeks.
  * If you decide you no longer want to receive these newsletters – or if you aren»t currently receiving it and want to – all you need to do is change your email preferences. You’ll find this in the “My Settings” area once you’re logged in (see above as to how to get there).



##  2\. The information we gather and track 

**Information gathered on registration** \- When you register for the Friends Reunited Dating Service, you provide your name, gender, email address, and various other items of information about you ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through your Member Details page.

**Cookies** \- We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users' experience of the Friends Reunited Dating Service as follows:

  1. To hold Members' login information, so that your Member Details are displayed when you visit the Friends Reunited Dating Service. This option can be turned off by switching the "Remember Your Password" option to "No" in your Member Details.
  2. To facilitate optimal use of the Friends Reunited Dating Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member's browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" text which appears on the Friends Reunited Dating Service.



**Neilsen Netratings** \- In addition we useNeilsen Netratings, an independent measurement and research company. They use cookies and code on the site to gather non-personal data regarding the number and frequency of visitors to our site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide general site and not personal statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page views, paths taken by visitors through the site and other general information. Friends Reunited Dating uses this type of information to help it improve the services to its members. Further information regarding Neilsen Netratings privacy statement can be found at [www.nielsen-netratings.com](http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/)

**Third party cookies** including those from **DoubleClick, TheSearchWorks** and **Google** are used on some parts of the site. They are used for tracking the success of advertising campaigns. These cookies are normally permanent.

##  3\. Storing and use of information 

The over-riding principles we apply are these:

  1. We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation, unless you agree to permit us to do so; and
  2. the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy.



**Registration Information** \- Some or all of the Registration Information posted by a Member will be made available to other Members in response to searches they make on the Friends Reunited Dating Service. Your name and email address will not be made available in this way, but the name you elect to be known as on the site will. It is up to you how anonymous you wish this name to be. Your photograph may also be disclosed.

We may also make your Registration Information available to other individuals who are not Members but are permitted by us to use some or all of this Friends Reunited Dating Service on websites operated by the Friends Reunited Group, including sites run for ITV, Trinity Mirror, GMTV and Guardian Media Group or our commercial partners such as Facebook. Again your name and email address will not be made available to other individuals without your consent, but the name you elect to be known as on the site will. It is up to you how anonymous you wish this name to be. Your photograph may also be disclosed.

**Email addresses** \- We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the Friends Reunited Dating Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with another Member as a result of viewing a search result found on the Friends Reunited Dating Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Full Member's behalf to the Member. The email sent will not include the sending Full Member's email address and the recipient can only respond through the Friends Reunited Dating site. By sending a message Full Members will not be disclosing their email address.

**Advertising** \- The Friends Reunited Dating Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately.

**Credit Card information** \- There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we use Worldpay plc and Datacash as our payment providers. Both operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members' credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members' full credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay plc and Datacash may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties.

**Companies in the Friends Reunited Dating group** \- We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy.

**Changes in Friends Reunited Dating business** \- If all of the assets which we use to operate our business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party so that the acquirer can continue to provide the Friends Reunited Dating Service.

**Place of processing** \- The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.

##  4\. Security 

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member's responsibility:

  * to protect against unauthorised access to Member Details
  * to ensure no-one else uses the Friends Reunited Dating Service on that Member»s machine while it is "logged on" to the Friends Reunited Dating Service
