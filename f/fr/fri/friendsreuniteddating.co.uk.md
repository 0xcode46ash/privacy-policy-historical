**FriendsReunitedDating Privacy Policy**

This is a legal document which sets out how FriendsReunitedDating handles data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with the [FriendsReunitedDating Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20050526082257id_/http%3A//www.friendsreuniteddating.co.uk/newfriends.asp?wci=terms), of which this Privacy Policy forms part.

At FriendsReunitedDating, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our users' personal information. This statement describes the privacy practices we apply for the FriendsReunitedDating Service. As part of that, it also expresses our approach to complying with the data protection laws which apply in the United Kingdom. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changed document in the same way as we notify changes to the [FriendsReunitedDating Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20050526082257id_/http%3A//www.friendsreuniteddating.co.uk/newfriends.asp?wci=terms).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact FriendsReunitedDating's [Customer Service Department - link]. 

**1.** |  **The information we gather and track.**

  * Information gathered on registration. When you register for the FriendsReunitedDating Service, you provide your name, gender, email address, and various other items of information about you ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through your Member Details page. 
  * Cookies. We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users' experience of the FriendsReunitedDating Service as follows: 
    * To hold Members' login information, so that your Member Details are displayed when you visit the FriendsReunitedDating Service. This option can be turned off by switching the "Remember Your Password" option to "No" in your Member Details.   

    * To facilitate optimal use of the FriendsReunitedDating Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member's browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" text which appears on the FriendsReunitedDating Service

**2.** | 

**Sharing and use of information**

  * The over-riding principles we apply are these:
    * We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation, unless you agree to permit us to do so; and 
    * the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy. 
  * Registration Information. Some or all of the Registration Information posted by a Member will be made available to other Members in response to searches they make on the FriendsReunitedDating Service. Your name and email address will not be made available in this way, but the name you elect to be known as on the site will. It is up to you how anonymous you wish this name to be. 
  * Email addresses. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the FriendsReunitedDating Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with another Member as a result of viewing a search result found on the FriendsReunitedDating Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Full Member's behalf to the Member. The email sent will include the sending Full Member's email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a contact message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any time through Member Details. Your Member Details must not include any email address. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email, your email address will be revealed. 
  * Advertising. The FriendsReunitedDating Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately. 
  * Newsletters. We have regular and occasional emails, which Members can decide to take or not, according to their preferences. This option is selected through Member Details. 
  * Credit Card information. There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Worldpay Limited, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members' credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members' credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay Limited may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties. 
  * Companies in the FriendsReunitedDating group. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy.
  * Changes in FriendsReunitedDating's business. If all of the assets which we use to operate our business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. 
  * Place of processing. The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.

  
**3.** | 

**Security**  
We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member's responsibility:

  * to protect against unauthorised access to Member Details; 
  * to ensure against use by anyone else of the FriendsReunitedDating Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to the FriendsReunitedDating Service;
  * to log off or exit from the FriendsReunitedDating Service when not using it; and 
  * to keep his/her password secret. 

  
**4.** |  **Opt-out policy**  


  * You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050526082257id_/http%3A//www.friendsreuniteddating.co.uk/newfriends.asp?wci=unregister) and we will remove all your Member Details. 
  * We provide Members with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mailed Newsletters which they have previously opted to receive. This opt-out can be effected by making appropriate selections in your Member Details. 

  
**5.** | **Disclosure for legal reasons**  
We reserve the right to communicate such of a Member's personal information as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.
