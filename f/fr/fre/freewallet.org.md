# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our app. 

### What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?

When ordering or registering in our app, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience. 

### When do we collect information?

We collect information from you when you register in our app, Open a Support Ticket or edit information in the app. 

### How do we use your information?

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a money transfer, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, or use certain other app features in the following ways: 

  * To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested. 
  * To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.
  * To quickly process your transactions. 



###  How do we protect visitor information? 

We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.  
We never ask for personal or private information like ID or credit card numbers.   
We use regular Malware Scanning. 

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information. 

### Third-party disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

### Third-party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services in our app. These third-party providers have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked services. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our app and welcome any feedback about these services.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

### According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

Users can visit our app anonymously by removing personal info from their account. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our app or website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information by logging in to their account and edeting their personal data.

### How does our app handle do not track signals?

We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. 

### Does our app allow third-party behavioral tracking?

It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking. We use Google Analytics to track user activity. All the tracked data is not personal. 

### COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.   
We do not specifically market to children under 13.

### Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. 

### In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We will notify the users via in-app notification within 7 business days.  
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

### CAN SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
