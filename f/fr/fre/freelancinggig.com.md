Provider reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure site performance and traffic in specific content areas; to gauge interest in specific content on a Site; to provide third parties with information about the usage behavior of our aggregate user base; or to provide advertisers with information about how many users have viewed or selected links associated with their advertisements, you should be aware that any personally identifying information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) publicly posted in the interactive sections of the site may be collected by third parties for unsolicited purposes. Provider does not take responsibility or liability for such actions, as they are beyond our control.

Provider may also choose to send a text file known as a "cookie" to our users. The cookie does not contain any personal identifying information. It can be used, for example, to tell how recently you have contacted our site, and it can retain information specific to your actions and selections on our site. (While it can retain information specific to your use of the site, it cannot retain information that can be used to specifically identify you.) We may choose to use this technology in order to provide for a more personal experience on the Site, to check whether you have visited our site before or for other purposes, such as ad delivery, so we can tailor your experience without violating your privacy.

On request, Provider will make all reasonable efforts to delete a user from any databases operated by Provider that may contain personal identifying information.

We encourage parents to get involved with their children's online activities.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
