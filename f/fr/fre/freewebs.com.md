**OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**

* * *

This site is owned and operated by UpIn60 Technologies, Inc., the parent company of FreeWebs.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At FreeWebs.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

**INFORMATION FREEWEBS.COM GATHERS AND TRACKS**

FreeWebs.com gathers two types of information about users:

Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions when creating a FreeWebs account such as your name or email address.

Information FreeWebs.com gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Because FreeWebs.com derives its revenue mainly from its paid services, gathering such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does FreeWebs.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party unless mandated by law.

FreeWebs.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:

**Optional Voluntary Information**

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

1\. Free Web Hosting

During the account creation process, the user is required to supply their full name, username, password, and email address. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Any files uploaded or created on the FreeWebs system are by nature of being hosted, for the public and are thus publicly accessible unless they are stored in the user's optional password-protected directory. Files in a password protected directory will only be accessible by means of a username and password which the user will provide. We will not disclose any information about a user's password protected directory username or password except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process.

2\. "E-mail this to a friend" Service

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.

3\. Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. FreeWebs.com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.

4\. Surveys

FreeWebs.com may occasionally conduct optional user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

**Children**

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

**Usage tracking**

FreeWebs.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. FreeWebs.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

FreeWebs.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. FreeWebs.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
