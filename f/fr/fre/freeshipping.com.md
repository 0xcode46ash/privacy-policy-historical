# Free Shipping Merchant Directory - Terms and Conditions

  
**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy covers the site www.freeshipping.com. ****

**Information Collection**  
freeshipping.com is the sole owner of the information collected on www.freeshipping.com. freeshiping.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

**Registration**  
In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. 

**Order**  
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial and security information (such as credit card number, expiration date, mother's maiden name). This information is used for billing purposes, to verify customer membership and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

**Claims**  
Members may provide additional information to freeshipping.com when claiming certain rebates and offers provided through this site. Such information may include the retailer where a purchase was made, the price paid, verification of the purchase transaction, specific information on the product purchased and where a lower price was viewed. In some cases, additional documentation is requested from the member, and sent to freeshipping.com either electronically, or via postal mail. 

**Information Use**

We use Personal Information to fulfill orders and to contact a member when necessary, such as when a delivery may be delayed or when membership terms have changed. We may also use this information to notify consumers about new products or services and special promotions offered by freeshipping.com or any of its affiliates. From time to time, we may also share your Personal Information with trustworthy unaffiliated third parties, who offer products or services that we feel may be of interest to you. We will never share your credit card information with an unaffiliated third party without your consent.

We may use Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the freeshipping.com web site. For example, we may use certain preferences you provide to tailor your experience at our site, such as showing you content and sending you notices concerning merchandise and services that may interest you. We may also share this Aggregate Information with other unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers interested in advertising on the freeshipping.com web site, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any personally identifiable information about you or any other person. 

**Profile  
**We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

**Cookies**  
"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Almost all web sites use cookies for these purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, after users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.   
Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  
  
**Log Files  
**Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)  
**Our third party advertising company may employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.

Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site (or advertising company) would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company. 

In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. 

**Claim Documentation  
**In the event that additional information is requested from a member to support a claim made under a specific benefit provided by freeshipping.com, we will use this information to validate the nature of the claim. This may include contacting the retailer where a purchase was made to verify that an item was purchased, the amount paid, if a rebate was utilized, or if an item has been returned. 

**Communications from the Site**

**Special Offers and Updates**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify enrollment. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, newsletters, etc. A user who completes or partially completes the registration form may receive newsletters or special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

**Customer Service**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their membership we reply via email or phone.

**Sharing**

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Third Party Intermediaries**  
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Service Providers**  
We may partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Business Transitions**  
In the event freeshipping.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

To opt out of the receipt of offers unrelated to this service, or to ongoing promotions available at freeshipping.com or its affiliates, please send an e-mail to customercare@freeshipping.com, with the subject "Opt-Out" and a message containing your name, address, and email account you use to log into freeshipping.com. While a member of this service, you cannot opt out of emails related to your membership or service benefits. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, freeshipping.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

**Address Verification**  
We use third party software to verify a address to ensure billing accuracy and to guard against fraudulent credit card charges. 

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), we provide a way to correct or update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member services page or by emailing our Customer Support at customercare@freeshipping.com

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

**Other Sites**

Our sites may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

**Contact Information**

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at customercare@freeshipping.com.

**Your Acceptance of this Policy**

By using this site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the freeshipping.com web site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
