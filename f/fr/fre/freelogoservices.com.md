(“LogoMix”) maintains, uses and shares information that we may collect when you use our websites at [www.freelogoservices.com](https://www.freelogoservices.com/), [logomix.com](https://www.logomix.com/), [printingnow.com](https://www.printingnow.com/) or [deluxelogocreator.com](https://www.deluxelogocreator.com/), including any products or services made available from time to time by means of any of these websites (the “Sites”).

We may change this privacy policy from time to time.  Any such changes will be posted here.  If we make a material change in the way we use your personal information, we will prominently note the change on the Sites and/or email you regarding the change at least thirty (30) days prior to the change taking effect.

We do not collect, use, or disclose any information about users of our Sites except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 2.    HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

Some of the information we collect when you use any of the Sites, such as your name, company name, postal address, email address, credit card information or telephone numbers, may allow you to be identified ("Personal Information").

**Registration:**   If you would like to create, edit or purchase rights to use a logo or other design (“Design”), order any merchandise displaying a Design (“Merchandise”) or use any other products or services that we may offer from time to time, you will be asked to provide Personal Information, which we will use to fulfill your request.

**Marketing Partnerships:**   We may make your Personal Information available to other organizations to market products or services that may be of interest to you. Such marketing may be via email, telephone, direct mail or other means.  _By providing your Personal Information on any of the Sites, you are expressly consenting to receive such marketing communications from us and others.  _

**Surveys:**   We may ask you to complete surveys or opinion polls from time to time. Participation is voluntary. We only use the information that we collect from surveys in an aggregate manner, not in individually identifiable form.

**Blogs and Forums:**   We may from time to time provide an opportunity for you to post information to blogs, forums or other public areas that we may implement on the Sites. If you post any Personal Information to such areas of any of the Sites, that information can be read, collected, or used by other visitors to these public areas.

**Inquiries:**   If you send us a comment or question or make an inquiry to customer support, we will retain the information that you provide to us for the purpose of responding to you, as well as for improving the Sites and our customers’ use of our services.

**Visitors:**   If you are just visiting one of the Sites and not creating or editing a Design, ordering Merchandise, registering, requesting information, contacting us, or posting to a public area of any of the Sites, we do not ordinarily collect any Personal Information about you except through web logs, as described below.

**Web Logs:**   We maintain web logs that automatically record basic information about everyone who visits any of the Sites. We use web log information to help us design the Sites, to identify popular features, to improve our services, and for other managerial and analytic purposes.  We may also use web logs to help identify any person who may be misusing any of the Sites.  These logs contain:

  * The Internet domain from which you access one of the Sites.
  * Your IP address.
  * The type of browser and operating system that you use.
  * The date and time you visited one of the Sites.
  * The pages that you visited on one of the Sites.
  * The address of the website you linked from to get to one of the Sites.



**Cookies:**   We use cookies and web beacons and may from time to time use other technologies to help you navigate the Sites, to allow us to learn how you use the Sites, and to improve the Sites. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not reveal any Personal Information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our Sites. However, once you choose to provide Personal Information to any of the Sites, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.  If you decide not to permit cookies on your computer, this may affect your ability to use the Sites.

**Pre-Populating Forms:**   When you enter certain contact information on websites of our marketing partners and then link to one of the Sites, your URL parameters may capture and transmit to us personal information that you provided on the partner website, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. We then use that information, for your convenience, to pre-populate Designs or forms on the Sites.  If you decide not to permit cookies on your computer, this may affect your ability to use the Sites.

**Communicating with You.**   We may use information that we collect from you for the purpose of communicating with you and responding to your inquiries.  Those communications could, for example, take the form of service updates, promotions for products or services that we or one of our marketing partners provide, or e-newsletters.

**Service Providers:**   We may at times contract with third party service providers to perform functions for us. These service providers may be given access to the information we collect for the purpose of performing those functions, but they will be contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality of the information and not to use it for any other purpose.   
In addition, when you use certain services offered by third parties on the Sites, the service providers will directly collect Personal Information from you while providing such services. Any Personal Information collected while you use these services will be subject to the respective privacy policies of such service providers. Current service providers, and links to their respective privacy policies, are set forth below. We may change this list of service providers, and our service providers may change their respective privacy policies, from time to time.

**Disclosures for Legal Reasons:**   We will disclose Personal Information when we are required to do so by law, regulation or securities exchange requirement, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement or other governmental agency's request or when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to protect our legal rights or to safeguard anyone’s property or safety.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current.

### 5.    SECURITY
