## Formerly FREE Postcode Lottery

Free Postcode Lottery Ltd. (“FPL” / “we”) collects information from our clients and potential clients at several different points on [freepostcodelottery.com](https://freepostcodelottery.com/) (the “Website”) as well as through email, postal and telephone correspondence, face-to-face meetings and through replies to questionnaires.

This Privacy Policy along with FPL’s [Terms and Conditions](https://freepostcodelottery.com/terms/) and [Cookie Policy](https://freepostcodelottery.com/cookies/) sets out the way FPL stores, analyses and uses data relating to you (your personal data) and the reasons for doing that. By continuing to access the Website, by providing information by email, post, phone, in person or through any other medium, you are accepting and consenting to FPL’s use of your personal data, as a Data Controller, in the ways set out in these policies.

#### Information Collected

The following personal data relating to you may be collected:

  * **Information you provide**. You may provide information to us through web forms on the Website, by email, or by phone. The information you provide may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number.We will not intentionally or systematically seek to collect, store, use or otherwise process information about you classed as ‘sensitive personal data’ (for example, information relating to any trade union membership, ethnic origin or medical conditions). We cannot prevent you from disclosing the same to FPL, or FPL’s agents, as part of your correspondence with us but you should ensure that such information is only provided where it is absolutely necessary.

#### Using Your Information

FPL uses the **information you provide** largely to contact you – by phone, email or by post – in order to seek further information, to update you on any changes to our service, to send you general commercial (non-marketing) communications, to send you any communications that you have specifically requested, and to inform you of any similar or related services that we provide that we consider may be of interest to you. We may keep this information on file to record enquiries that we have received about our service, to help us to assess how effective our various marketing programs are, and to comply with any legal obligations that may be imposed upon us from time to time.
