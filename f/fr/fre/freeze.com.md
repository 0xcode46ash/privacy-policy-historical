# F r e e z e . c o m : A new degree of free.

Freeze.com, LLC is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to determine how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Please read Freeze.com's policy on children's privacy below.

**What personally identifiable information does Freeze.com collect from me?**

Freeze.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Freeze.com asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Freeze.com; you are given a Freeze.com ID and are able to take full advantage of Freeze.com's many offerings.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Freeze.com and/or our many partners; request access to our entertainment or computer utilities offerings, etc., or agree to download our content for your use. If you contact Freeze.com, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Freeze.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Freeze.com collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that specified page.

**What are cookies and how does Freeze.com use them?**

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Freeze.com uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Any of the Freeze.com family of sites, including Screen-Savers.com, which ask you to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See "What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?" for more information on cookies.)

**Generally, we use cookies to:**

(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. Freeze.com also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages.

(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Freeze.com is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.

(3) Assist affiliates and merchants associated with Freeze.com to track visits to and business at their sites and stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store.

(4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, downloads, sweepstakes and contests. When a Freeze.com-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings.

(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example areas of Freeze.com's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on Freeze.com a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

Advertising networks that serve ads onto Freeze.com may also use their own cookies.

Freeze.com also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, Freeze.com Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.

**How does Freeze.com use my information?  
**   
Freeze.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation in opt-in mailings. By knowing a little about you, Freeze.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Freeze.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Freeze.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only Freeze.com has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Freeze.com. You will only receive special offers via email from Freeze.com if you have indicated in your account preferences, or at some other time, that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences or notify the sender of e-mail to unsubscribe you at any time.

Freeze.com does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Freeze.com may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

**Who is collecting information?**

When you are on a Freeze.com site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Freeze.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some Freeze.com services, like contests and games, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Freeze.com, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.

Promotions that run on Freeze.com may be sponsored by companies other than Freeze.com or may be co-sponsored by Freeze.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most Freeze.com promotions are limited to U.S. or North American residents.

Please be aware that Freeze.com partners, advertisers, and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites linked to Freeze.com are not covered by this privacy statement.

**With whom does Freeze.com share my information?**

As a general rule, Freeze.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when you have decided to opt-in to receive information, we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors: Freeze.com may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected during a Freeze.com promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give Freeze.com permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared, in other cases, more demographic information may be shared.

Freeze.com Shopping: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by Freeze.com, or a merchant associated with Freeze.com, the information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place.

Merchants associated with Freeze.com have separate privacy and data collection practices. Freeze.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, Freeze.com will (with your permission) share your name, email address and other information you provide with them.

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate: Under confidentiality agreements, Freeze.com may match user information with third party data. Also, Freeze.com discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Other: Freeze.com may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Freeze.com's policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Freeze.com's rights or property, other Freeze.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Freeze.com may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

**What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**

Freeze.com may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Freeze.com and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Freeze.com (or agents working on behalf of Freeze.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit your Freeze.com Account Information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will need your Freeze.com ID and Password in order to access your Freeze.com account; information.

On some types of Freeze.com promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Freeze.com services that require registration in order to participate. These services include (but are not limited to): Freeze.com and Freeze Mail, Frogpond.com, Clip-Art.com, Screen-Savers.com, and creating a portfolio in any other Freeze.com family member.

**What is Freeze.com's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?**

You may edit your Freeze.com Account Information and your public Freeze.com Profile at any time by using your Freeze.com ID and password. If you have forgotten your password, please click here to request a new password. For all other problems signing in to Freeze.com, please click here and complete this form.

Your Freeze.com account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not being able to access any members-only area of the Freeze.com network, including your Freeze.com Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation email you received when you first created your Freeze.com account, you can use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time. Please contact privacypolicy@Freeze.com for further instructions about deleting or deactivating your Freeze.com account. Residual information will remain within our archive records.

If you are participating in a Freeze.com promotion and you wish to update your email address on the promotions mailing list or to quit a promotion and cease receiving promotion-related email, please contact [promotions-feedback@Freeze.com](mailto:promotions-feedback@Freeze.com).

**What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**

Your Freeze.com Account Information and Freeze.com Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your Freeze.com Account Information and Freeze.com Profile by using your Freeze.com ID and password.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Freeze.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your Freeze.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Freeze.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**What about children's privacy?**

The safety of children is very important to us. Freeze.com is a family of general audience web sites that comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. When a child under age 13 attempts to register with Freeze.com, we ask that they have a parent or guardian establish a Freeze.com Family Account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. Freeze.com Family Accounts allow parents to review, edit and delete information relating to their child's Freeze.com account. If a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information by Freeze.com, that parent can send an email to [account-remove@Freeze.com](mailto:account-remove@Freeze.com) to request deletion of their child's account.

Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. Freeze.com abides by this requirement.

Freeze.com does not share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties. Freeze.com will not contact users who are under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes. All Freeze.com account holders, including parents and children with Freeze.com Family Accounts, are subject to this Privacy Policy.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
