**How We Collect Information**

Sunhawk collects personally identifying information when customers:

> 1\. purchase digital music, print music or other products  
>  2\. provide content suggestions or send queries to Sunhawk employees  
>  3\. enter drawings, sweepstakes, contests or sign-up for Sunhawk's e-mail newsletter

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of the Sunhawk.com site. However, you will not have access to areas and products that require personal identification.

When you register or order online, Sunhawk collects your name, mailing address and in some instances your credit card number. We also collect User IDs, User Names and passwords.

We respect your right to privacy and have implemented this Privacy Policy in recognition of the importance of using in a responsible way the information you choose to provide us.

**How We Use The Information We Collect**

We use the information to help us improve our communications with you so you receive more of what you want and less of what you don't want. We send confirmation e-mail to our customers when we receive orders and ship orders. We also provide our customers with a newsletter that introduces new products and provides Sunhawk updates.

We use credit card information to process orders; never for marketing purposes.

We use information received from drawings, contests and sweepstakes to administer these promotions. We also use this information to let you know about our products and services.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, or unless your prior permission is obtained, Sunhawk does not share with third parties personally identifying information collected from the distribution of Sunhawk products or gathered on the Sunhawk website, except that Sunhawk may share such information with third parties who are the developer, owner or licensor of the product or service in question. Finally, we must reserve the right to disclose information if required by law to do so.

**About IP Addresses**

Sunhawk collects IP addresses to help with its system administration.

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're connected to the Internet. Web servers – the big computers that "serve" up Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

When customers request pages from Sunhawk.com, our servers log the customers' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
