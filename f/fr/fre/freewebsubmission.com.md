# Free Web Submission: Free Search Engine Submission and Site Promotion

This Privacy Policy covers the Free Web Submission treatment of personal information that is recorded when you submit your site through our free autosubmission service. 

Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies advertised, or otherwise listed, on the Free Web Submission web site, nor does it extend to people that Free Web Submission does not employ or manage. 

#### Information Collection and Use

Unlike many submission services that charge for site submission and collect personal information as well, Free Web Submission is a free service. The only information collected during site submission is Name, Email Address, URL, and IP Address. 

Your use of Free Web Submission's autosubmission service constitutes a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for your web site(s). In exchange, Free Web Submission reserves the right to use the contact information collected during site submission to deliver notices regarding changes or updates to our service, to provide free sample newsletters, to inform you of additions to the GreenWave Online Network of web sites, or to send announcements and carefully screened offers and information from our partners. 

With the exception of autoresponse messages which are sent at the time of autosubmission and contain important site submission results, you may remove yourself from any or all other notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes at least 2 methods to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you encounter problems in this regard, contact: inquiry[at]freewebsubmission.com. Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 24 hours. 

#### Cookies

Ad networks and third party vendors, including Google, may place cookies on your browser while visiting Free Web Submission. Google's DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to Free Web Submission and/or other websites. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie [here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) and cookies from many other ad networks [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

#### Security

Your personal information is stored in a protected directory. Access is restricted to Free Web Submission staff. 

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Free Web Submission may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes are made in the way your personal information is used, we will post a prominent announcement on our site notifying you of the change. 

#### Questions or Suggestions

Questions or suggestions may be sent to: inquiry[at]freewebsubmission.com
