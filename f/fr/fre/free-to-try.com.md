# Privacy Policy:

**Free-To-Try Softwareâ€™s Privacy Policy:**

Free-To-Try Software will never sell or give our customer or client information to third parties. For customers, this means that the only people who have access to your address information is our 3rd party credit card processor. 

What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When ordering from any of our sites or partner sites we collect the purchaser's name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill orders and provide notification of the order status. 

How do 3rd party credit card processors protect customer information?

Customers who buy through Free-To-Try Software are shopping on a secure server hosted by RegNow and other 3rd party credit card processors that encrypts all of the customer's personal information including name, address and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use personal information in an unauthorized manner. 

RegNow.com commerce system was developed in-house with security as its number one priority. This single entry point allows Free-To-Try Software/RegNow to maintain the tightest access control - eliminating (rather than closing) the backdoor.
