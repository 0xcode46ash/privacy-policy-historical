# Freddie Mac Terms and Conditions: Privacy Policy

Freddie Mac recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of your personal and financial information. We are committed to privacy practices that protect the confidentiality and security of this information. Our information practices for personal and financial information you enter or that we collect exclusively through your use of FreddieMac.com website are set forth below.

## **Information We Collect**

If you visit FreddieMac.com to read or download information, we collect and store: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (such as aol.com); the Internet protocol address of the host server you are using (such as ww3.aol.com); the name and version of your Web browser (such as Netscape 4.0); the date and time you access FreddieMac.com; and, if you came to us through a link from some other website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked to us. We do not collect your name or email address. No information we collect in this way is directly or indirectly traceable back to a specific person. 

We use this information for general statistical modeling, in order to measure the number of visitors to different pages on FreddieMac.com and to modify FreddieMac.com in order to make FreddieMac.com more helpful. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized access or unusual activity on FreddieMac.com. We do not sell this information to third party companies. 

Some parts of FreddieMac.com may use a "cookie," which is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard drive. The cookie captures no personally identifiable information. FreddieMac.com may use a cookie in order to log which pages you visit on FreddieMac.com or to provide certain features during your visit to FreddieMac.com. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies; however, some enhancement features of FreddieMac.com may not function properly if you do this.

## **Information You Provide**

If you send us an email or message and provide your name or other personal and financial information, we may keep this information. We may use this information to send an answer to your question or deliver requested information to you. We also may use information that you provide to measure general statistics about visits to FreddieMac.com and interest in particular areas. We do not sell this information to third party companies. We may disclose information from website visitors to third parties, such as contractors, consultants and other service providers, so that the third party can provide a business, professional or technical support function for the website visitor or for Freddie Mac. 

By sending an email or making a request or inquiry, you agree to permit Freddie Mac to keep and use the information you have given us consistent with this policy. 

If you enter personal and financial information into a financing or affordability calculator offered on FreddieMac.com – such as income, the down payment you want to make, the length of a loan you want, the price of a home you have in mind – that information is not seen or received by Freddie Mac. The calculator's functions are performed by your computer and the results are displayed in your browser and viewable only by you.   


## **Business Users**

Except as described in this paragraph and in the following paragraph, FreddieMac.com privacy policy statement does not apply to information provided to us by business entities, even if the information is transmitted to us through FreddieMac.com. If you enter information in an online form to register as a Freddie Mac business customer or as a user of Loan Prospector or other business tools, we may keep this information. We may use the business information that you provide in the registration in order to verify your eligibility to use FreddieMac.com or business tool that you wish to use, or to provide you access to the service. Information that you provide in this manner also may be used to measure general statistics about visits to FreddieMac.com and interest in particular areas. We do not sell the information you provide in this manner to third party companies.

If you are a business customer and you use FreddieMac.com in the course of business with Freddie Mac, then information that you submit may be used and disclosed in the same ways as information that we receive outside of FreddieMac.com. For example, information you provide concerning borrowers whose loans Freddie Mac purchases may be disclosed to certain third parties such as loan servicers, consumer reporting agencies, workout companies and foreclosure attorneys in order to process and administer a loan or protect our interest in a loan. Freddie Mac requires servicers and other third parties to follow appropriate security and confidentiality standards to protect borrower information. In addition, information about borrowers that you provide may be used for risk management, predicting borrower creditworthiness, and evaluating borrower defaults. Freddie Mac releases borrower information when required by law or regulation, such as to respond to a subpoena or other judicial process or to comply with requests from our regulators.

Freddie Mac does not sell or disclose the information received concerning borrowers whose loans it purchases to third party companies for marketing purposes.

## **Security**

Freddie Mac has adopted policies and practices designed to protect the security and confidentiality of borrower and consumer information, to protect against anticipated threats and hazards to security and integrity of the information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience. Freddie Mac uses a variety of security measures to protect the transmission of information submitted to us through FreddieMac.com. 

## **Changes to This Privacy Statement**

We reserve the right to revise or change this policy in the future. Any changes to our policy will be clearly and conspicuously posted on this section of FreddieMac.com.
