# Privacy Policy

Our commitment to privacy. Your privacy, as well as your child's privacy, is of utmost importance to us. At eLibs, one of our primary goals is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. Therefore, in order to better protect your (and your child's) privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your (and your child's) information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally-identifiable information may be requested. The following notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the eLibs' website.

**What information is collected?**

Personally-Identifiable Information: eLibs does not collect personally-identifiable information on our visitors unless they voluntarily provide it to us, and we will only collect information from children younger than 13 if such information is reasonably necessary to allow them to participate in a particular online activity. Locations within our website where personal information may be requested include pages where the visitor can enter sweepstakes and contests, subscribe to email newsletters, register to receive materials, and submit articles or materials for posting to our website. The types of personal information collected at these pages can include the visitor's full name, email address, mailing address, and date of birth.

For some activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or an email message to a friend, we may also ask for personal information about the third party receiving the postcard or message. This information is usually limited to the name and email address of the recipient, and is generally deleted once the postcard or message has been sent. 

Non-personally Identifiable Information: For some activities, we may ask visitors to provide information about themselves that is not personally identifiable. This information might include their city and/or state of residence, zip code, age, and gender.

eLibs will also collect at times, through the use of "cookies" (see the section on cookies below), other non-personally identifiable information on visitors; collecting this information will allow us to improve the design and content of our site, and to personalize our visitors' experience on eLibs.

**How does eLibs use and share the information that has been collected?**

ELIBS HAS THE RIGHT TO SELL, MARKET, TRADE OR OTHERWISE SHARE PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY, REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON'S AGE. ALL INFORMATION COLLECTED ON CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 13 IS USED FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES ONLY, and is used only for activities such as marketing of eLibs' products, programs or services, notifying sweepstakes or contest winners, and emailing eLibs stories. Any personal information that we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes is immediately deleted after the completion of the particular event. Information about another person that has been provided to us by a visitor will be used only to enable that visitor to communicate with such person; for example, by allowing the visitor to send such person an  
electronic postcard or email message.

Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes or contest, or sending prizes to winners. In these cases, we require any such agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. 

We sometimes use and aggregate non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site, to analyze site usage, to personalize our visitors' experience on eLibs, and to offer products, programs and services. 

We will disclose any information we maintain as required by law; for example, we will disclose such information in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.

**Does eLibs use "cookies"?**

  
eLibs uses a software technology commonly called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. eLibs uses cookies to enable the visitor's computer to remember the visitor's password, email addresses of friends, and stories that have been read or created and submitted by them. The use of "cookie" files has become an industry standard for many, if not most, of the many thousands of companies doing business on the internet. Like these other companies, eLibs.com also uses cookies in an effort to provide a more meaningful web surfing experience to internet users. Most browsers permit you to remove cookies that have been previously stored, as well as prevent the future use of cookies. You may also delete the eLibs.com cookie file with your computer. If you would like to do so, please follow the following directions:

**Does eLibs notify parents about the collection of information  
about kids 12 and younger?**

eLibs requires that all users provide us with (among other things) their age and, if they are under the age of 13, with their parents' email addresses, so that we can (i) notify their parents or guardians that we have received information from their children, (ii) provide their parents or guardians with the option of having their child's name removed from our mailing lists, and (iii) obtain their parents' or guardians' consent prior to allowing their child to post messages, communicate with others through our website, or utilize other features of our website where personally-identifiable information can be made available to the public via the Internet and shared with users of all ages.

**Why type of security does eLibs provide?**

The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with our visitors is our greatest concern. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, eLibs has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

In addition, there are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, as this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using the internet so that other people using the same computer will not have access to your information.

**How do parents access information about their kids?**

At eLibs, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF THEIR CHILD'S PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSENTING TO THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. In order to allow parents to review any personally-identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of their child's information, we have set up a system by which parents can print out a form, execute it accordingly, and then mail or fax the form back to us. In order to receive the form, please click on the following link:  
[Personal Information Access - Inquiry Form  
](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202175002id_/http%3A//www.elibs.com/e/p/parentform) Please send this form to the address or fax number provided at the bottom of the form (also set forth below). eLibs takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
