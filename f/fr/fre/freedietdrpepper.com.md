# Yahoo! Privacy Policy

Most promotions that are hosted or co-sponsored by Yahoo! don't require you to be a Yahoo! registered user.

Information Collection and Use Practices

  * When you enter a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest hosted by Yahoo! or sponsored by Yahoo! and/or our many partners, we ask for your name, address, and email address.
  * You may be asked to provide additional information or to answer certain questions, some of which may be optional, in order to participate.
  * We may contact you in connection with a particular promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest, in order to update you of your status, administer the promotion, let you know that a promotion has ended, and for other purposes. 



Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices

  * Promotions that are hosted on Yahoo! may be sponsored by Yahoo!, may be co-sponsored by Yahoo! and another company, or may be sponsored by companies other than Yahoo!. Some or all of the data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor(s) or companies indicated on the entry form.
  * Promotions that are hosted by a third party may collect and use information alone or in conjunction with Yahoo!. The nature of this information sharing policy will be indicated on the entry form. If information is collected and used by a third party, you will need to see their Privacy Policy to understand how that information may be used.
  * If data will be shared, then there will be notice prior to the time of data collection or transfer. 



Practices regarding cookies

  * Some promotions, sweepstakes or contests may use cookies in order to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
