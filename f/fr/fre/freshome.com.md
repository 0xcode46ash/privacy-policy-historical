# Privacy Policy - Freshome.com

### Privacy Policy

At Freshome, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personal information you may provide us through our Website.

This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected on Freshome, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

### The Information We Collect and How We Use It

Our Website typically collects two types of information about you:

Information that you provide that personally identifies you

If you send us an e-mail or a comment, you may choose to provide us with personal information, such as your name or your e-mail address. We use the information to improve our service to you, provide you with updates, or to respond to your requests.

Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content on our Website.

Information that does not personally identify you, that we automatically collect when you visit our Website

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We typically collect and store details about your visit, such as the Internet domain (for example, website.com if you use a private Internet access account), your IP address address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web), the type of browser and operating system used to access our site, the pages you visit, the date and time you access our Website and if you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website.

We use the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors to the different pages on our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.

### Keeping Your Information Secure

We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.
