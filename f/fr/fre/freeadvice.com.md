## Privacy Statement for FreeAdvice.com

FreeAdvice.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the FreeAdvice.com website. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing [admin@adviceco.com](mailto:admin@adviceco.com)

FreeAdvice, recognized as a leading consumer and small business legal website, is a unit of Advice Company (Advice & Counsel Incorporated), a leading provider of information and advice on the Internet and E-commerce solutions for individuals and small businesses. We invite you to explore our Web site and find out what all the talk is about.

### **Information this Site Gathers/Tracks**

We collect aggregate information site-wide, including anonymous site stats. We also log domain names and/or IP addresses. On certain pages we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, demographic, preference and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. Such personal information is not gathered by us without users` knowing and active permission and participation. 

Portions of our site use “cookies” to keep track of your visit, to help you navigate between sections, thus delivering content specific to your interests and to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.  A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie contains is information you supply yourself. A cookie does not  read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 

Most of our site does not require that visitors complete a registration form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit. Our Bulletin Boards do not require that visitors register or use their actual names to post questions or to provide answers, although those who do register receive certain benefits, such as automatic email notification of responses and edit privileges. Visitors may also register for our Email newsletters. However, we require visitors to register and identify themselves when using our one on one chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our site and our company. We reserve the right to use customer contact information to contact a visitor when we deem it necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

This site contains links to other sites. FreeAdvice.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

Certain portions of our site are also the result of special relationships, such as "Powered By" or Co-branding or affiliate programs. For example, we provide a Free Email feature in cooperation with CommTouch, a Bookstore in affiliation with Amazon.com, and Legal Forms in conjunction with US Legal Forms. These firms share varying amounts of information with us. You should review the privacy policies of such providers.

Certain portions of our site may provide a form for customers to request or share or distribute information, or order products or services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and, if they are making a credit card purchase, financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our Web site and our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when we believe it is necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our Web site and company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when we believe it is necessary or appropriate. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

FreeAdvice displays advertising on the Web site and we also use outside ad companies to display ads on our site.  We work with several unaffiliated companies that serve ads.  These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and/or ad companies, and we do not have access to this information. To find out more about how these sites have told us they manage the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on our site, please go to  <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html> and <http://www.l90.com/external_site/privacy_policy.html>
