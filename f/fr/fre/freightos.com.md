This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Service from various URLs operated by us, such as _www.freightos.com_ and _www.freightos.com_ , but will not apply to sites powered by Freightos and operated by third parties including sites at subdomains of freightos.com which are powered by Tradeos technology but which also are operated by third parties who have a Software-as-a-Service relationship with us regarding the Service, and on which websites this Privacy Policy is not posted. 

How can the terms of this Privacy Policy be modified?

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. You agree to review this Privacy Policy periodically to be aware of such modifications. You further agree that your continued use of the Service after any such modifications have been made shall be deemed to be your conclusive acceptance of any modified version of this Privacy Policy. We will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by updating the date indicated after Last Updated at the beginning of this Privacy Policy and significant changes will be posted to the “Site News” RSS feed to which you should subscribe. We will be happy to provide you with prior versions of this Privacy Policy upon your written request to us. If you do not agree to abide by the initial version or any modified version of this Privacy Policy, then you are not authorized to use the Service. The current version of this Privacy Policy is accessible via the footer of the Service’s homepage. 

How does the Service Work?

The Service enables participating buyers and sellers who have registered with us, and affirmatively indicated their agreement to abide by Tradeos’ terms of service agreement located at _http://www.freightos.com/terms.html_ or otherwise linked to from the footer of this page (the “Terms of Service”) by means of a click-through consent or other legally enforceable mechanism, to execute transactions through the Service (each, a "User" and collectively, "Users") and for anonymous visitors (each, a "Visitor" and collectively, "Visitors") to utilize certain of the Service's functionality and features. All references to "you", "your", and "yours" hereunder shall refer to both Users and Visitors unless the context of this Privacy Policy indicates otherwise. This Privacy Policy sets forth the terms and conditions which govern your use of the Service. 

By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use by Tradeos of your PII and the PII of individuals or entities using the Service in connection with a transaction undertaken by you, and other information collected from you, as described in this Privacy Policy. 

What type of PII does Tradeos collect from you and how do we use it?

Users submit various forms of their PII to the Service, including without limitation, their name, address, phone number, email address and other biographical information. Users may also provide us with certain financial information that constitutes PII, such as their credit card or bank information. Sellers also provide us with their price lists and offers, some of which may also contain PII. 

Tradeos may provide your PII to individuals or entities who work with us or on our behalf. These individuals or entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Service and to help us communicate with you about different services or resources offered through the Service. For example, we may transfer certain of your PII or other information to our payment gateway, other service providers and other third parties who assist us in operating the Service or who help us in executing requests made by you. Tradeos also collects and uses non-PII as is further described below. 

Payment information is transmitted through the Service via Secure Socket Layer (SSL or HTTPS) technology, and is encrypted by our payment gateway(s) once received. When you provide PII to us through the Service in connection with a quote or order from a seller of services or a buyer request, your PII will be kept in our databases in order to facilitate future transactions. Certain of your PII will also be transferred to such Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, in order to facilitate communication between you both. 

Tradeos may list corporate User names and display your logo, in our customer lists which are included from time to time in our marketing material (without otherwise implying any endorsement by you of the Service or Tradeos). 

Under what other circumstances may we release PII to third parties?

We may also release your PII to third parties if we believe that such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization or requirement) or a court order, to apply or enforce the Terms of Service or otherwise protect our interests, to protect Users, to protect against the fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Service, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person or property requires disclosure of such PII. 

Our rights under this Privacy Policy may be automatically assigned by Tradeos, in our sole discretion, to a third party and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limitation of the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including without limitation PII collected by us through the Service, with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, as well as with a potential acquirer, including without limitation in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. 

Is information that I post to public areas of the Service private?

Relevant PII and other information you provide in connection with a quote, offer, or otherwise relating to a transaction to be executed (or which you contemplate shall be executed) through the Service shall be publicly viewable by other Users. The Service also may enable you to post comments and other information to portions of the Service which are publicly viewable (such as message boards, reviews, and the like). All of this information is publicly viewable and will not remain private, and therefore you should not post any information to these portions of the Service unless you wish for such information be viewed publicly. Please do not post any PII to publicly viewable portions of the Service without first receiving the express written consent of the person whose PII is viewable and please carefully weigh the potential negative ramifications of posting PII to public areas of the Service. 

What other information does Tradeos collect and how may this be used?

We may also collect aggregate information from you about your preferences in using the Service by using cookies, action tags, IP addresses, and other methods. Cookies are small text files that enable us and third parties (such as advertisers) to identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Service usage, and customize Service features. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the Service owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time at which such webpage was viewed. Action tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such aggregate information for promotional and other business purposes. 

Do I have the ability not to be identified by Tradeos other than by the PII you provide us?

Yes. If you do not wish to be identified by us (other than by the PII you provide to us), you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. If you do not want us to have any of your PII, do not submit any of your PII to us. Please keep in mind that if you refuse cookies you will not be able to sign into to or otherwise use the Service. 

How do we store and safeguard information?

Tradeos takes steps consistent with commercially reasonable industry standards to secure PII collected from you from unauthorized access while under our control. However, please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or unauthorized acts. 

Does Tradeos provide links to other Services?

Tradeos may provide links to websites of possible interest to you, or such links may be provided by Users. The collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not those contained in this Privacy Policy. 

What are our policies regarding children?

The Service is intended for general use of persons who have reached the age of consent in their jurisdiction of residence, and specifically is not targeted to anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. Tradeos does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. If we learn that we have unwittingly collected PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age, we will promptly delete such information. 

Do we have a mechanism to address the removal of PII and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?

If you wish to remove PII that you have submitted to Tradeos, please send us an email requesting such removal to _privacy@tradeos.com_ and we will undertake reasonably commercial efforts, to the extent removal is plausible, to remove such PII from the Service. If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, please contact us at _privacy@tradeos.com_.
