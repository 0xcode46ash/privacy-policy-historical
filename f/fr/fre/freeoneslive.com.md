We know you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting FreeOnes Live, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.** What Personal Information About Customers Does FreeOnes Live Gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at FreeOnes Live. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, and communicating with you. 

You provide most such information when you buy, or participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you purchase a product; join a site; provide information to customer support regarding an account (you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address, user name, or credit card when shopping with us); communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; or complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone number; credit card information; e-mail addresses; birth date and content of e-mails to us. 

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses FreeOnes Live. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from these anonymous services. 

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number. 

  * To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from FreeOnes Live. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, simply send email to [remove@freeoneslive.com](mailto:remove@freeoneslive.com). 

What About Cookies?

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as "What's New". 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

Does FreeOnes Live Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the subsidiaries FreeOnes Live, controls and as described below. 

  * We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes. 
  * Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of VideoSecrets customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please send email to [remove@freeoneslive.com](mailto:remove@freeoneslive.com)
  * As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of FreeOnes Live, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
  * Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

How Secure Is Information About Me?

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We reveal only the last eight digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

What Information Can I Access?

FreeOnes Live gives you access to the following information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. This list will change as our Web site evolves.

What Choices Do I Have?

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase. 
  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the "What Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 
  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send email to [remove@freeoneslive.com](mailto:remove@freeoneslive.com) (If you do not want to receive Terms and Conditions and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of FreeOnes Live, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such services as FreeOnes Live and other live shows if you do not use cookies. 
  * In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet .
