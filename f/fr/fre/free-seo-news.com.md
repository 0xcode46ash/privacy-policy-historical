# Axandra privacy policy

At Axandra GmbH we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment for anyone who visits and purchases. We are committed to providing you with the best possible online service and experience as well as the best products. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you:

  * why the Axandra online shop is so secure 
  * a complete description of what we collect 
  * how we use that information 
  * how you can access or correct your information 



We never rent, sell or share any information you give us. You privacy is important to us!

**What information does Axandra GmbH collect, and how is it used?**

When you visit the Axandra.com site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then collate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive unlock codes. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

  * First and last name 
  * Billing address 
  * Shipping address(es) 
  * Email address 
  * Phone number 
  * Credit card account number 
  * Titles of items you purchase from us 



**The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order, to send you our announement newsletter (we'll inform you when updates are available) and to use it internally for statistical reasons. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Credit Card Processing and Security**

Shopping with Axandra GmbH is absolutely safe - you never have to worry about credit-card safety when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them.

Axandra GmbH uses the services of SWREG.org to provide the highest level of secure online transactions. Your credit card information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. SWREG.org maintains their own privacy and security policies. If you have questions about these services, or how they handle the information they receive, please contact [SWREG](http://www.swreg.org/).

All information you enter in the SWREG.org order form will be shared with Axandra GmbH in order to send you the unlock code for the software. This does not apply to your credit card information. We never get your credit card number. SWREG will send you a single additional email message one week after your purchase.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by sending us an email with your name and the unlock code for the Axandra product you purchased. The exception, as explained above or in the "Credit Card Processing and Security" section, is your credit information, since it is not kept.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Our 100% guarantee**

We believe in what we do. We'll gladly give you a complete refund of the purchase price if you decide within 30 days after your purchase that you don't like our software products.

Shopping with Axandra.com is 100% safe - you never have to worry about credit card safety when you are shopping at our site. We guarantee that each purchase you make is protected and safe. If fraudulent charges are ever made, you will not have to pay for them.

  * Safety in Numbers: Axandra products are sold by SWREG, Inc. USA. SWREG is one of the oldest and biggest online stores on the Internet. When you shop at Atlantic Coast, you'll be one of thousands of customers who have safely shopped with SWREG without credit card fraud.
  * Safe Technology: SWREG's secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts your credit card number, so that it cannot be read while the information travels over the Internet. 



In general, under federal law of the United States, you will not be liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. In the unlikely event that you are subject to fraudulent charges, remember to first notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, for whatever reason, you are held responsible for this amount, Axandra.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to $50, as long as the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made from Axandra.com while using the secure SWREG.org server.
