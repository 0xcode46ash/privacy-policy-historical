**WiredReality Chat  **

Registered or unregistered members may chat in WiredReality's chat rooms, which are moderated by volunteers and a moderation robot. However, members under 13 years of age will be required to register at WiredReality before being able to chat.  Members are NOT allowed to give out any information in the chat rooms that will individually identify them. If any such information is given out, the member will be kicked from Chat. Only a parent can determine what is appropriate for your own child. There maybe chats where the topic or the language is not something you wish your child to participate in, its important that you supervise your child's use of the chat area. You should teach your child to not give out any personal information to others online.
