During the shipment administration process, Freightquote.com requests shipment information from the user in order to process their shipment. This information includes shipping and receiving addresses, product descriptions and the date and time of the shipment. Freightquote.com utilizes this information to generate an electronic pickup with a freight carrier and to forward the necessary shipping documents to the shipping or receiving parties. All of this information is required in order to correctly process a shipment request.
