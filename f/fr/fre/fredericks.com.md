Privacy and security are two of the biggest issues facing users of the Internet. 

Here at fredericks.com, we understand that - which is why we want to assure everyone who visits our site that we follow the highest industry standards regarding safety, security and personal privacy. Privacy refers to information we obtain about you and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We also have a [Security Statement](https://web.archive.org/services/help.asp?76&SID=VQPQUMX42WSR2LBS00AKHEJRLGBXF416) that describes how sensitive information is kept safe and secure.

**WHEN I VISIT YOUR WEB SITE, WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU COLLECT ABOUT ME?**

At fredericks.com, your privacy and security are two of our highest priorities. We never collect any personal information about you unless you request a service that requires it. Then, we only ask for the specific information that is needed to satisfy your request. Any information you do provide is kept in the strictest confidence. So are all of your transactions on our Web site. The only profile or demographic information used is on an aggregate basis in summary reports. (A summary report, for instance, may state "100,000 people clicked on image_123 and, of those people, 60 percent were between the ages of 18 and 26.") 

One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this Web site is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Currently, you will have to provide the information listed below in order to take advantage of the following services: 

  * **Catalog Requests** Naturally, we need a name and an address to send the catalog to. Plus a contact - phone or e-mail - in case the address is wrong. We occasionally make our customer names and postal mailing addresses available to other reputable companies whose products might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these mailings, please copy your catalog mailing label exactly and send to: 

> **Mail Preference Service  
>  Frederick's of Hollywood  
>  P.O. Box 2949  
>  Phoenix, AZ 85062-2949**

  * **Star Club Signup** Our exclusive preferred customer club is where you receive members only discounts, advanced purchase notification, sneak peek views at new merchandise and other fantastic benefits….all for FREE! We simply need an e-mail address and your product preferences. Membership can be canceled at any time by going to the Star Club signup page and clicking on "unsubscribe" or by replying to any Star Club e-mail with a blank message. We never share or sell e-mail addresses to anyone.

**HOW DOES FREDERICKS.COM KEEP TRACK OF ME AS I MOVE THROUGH YOUR WEB SITE?**

In the original design for the Web, there was no way for a Web site to know whether one page request was connected to another. For most sites, this is fine. In an information only site, for example, each article is independent of the others. Visitors see what they want, then leave. 

For fredericks.com and others selling on the Internet, this is a real problem. We want you to be able to select several products before purchasing them. We want the selection process and the checkout process to span more than one page. In other words, we need a way of keeping track of Web site _sessions_ rather than merely page requests. 

The way fredericks.com deals with this is with a "session ID." The session ID contains absolutely no personal information about you. It is completely unique to each session, and changes each time a new session is created. The sole purpose is to enable us to know that the person who added the H2O Water Bra to their basket is the same person as the one who wants the marabou baby doll.

**DOES FREDERICKS.COM USE COOKIES?**

A cookie is a small data file that most Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID, which the site can use to track which pages on the site you've visited. By themselves, cookies can't be used to identify individuals. fredericks.com uses cookies to help keep track of your preferences so that we can tailor your shopping experience to better suit your needs. We also use cookies to monitor traffic patterns on our site, to let us know whether you've visited our site in the past, and to determine whether you came to our site from a particular Internet link or sponsored advertisement. If you disable the use of cookies on your browser, your access to fredericks.com is not possible. Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know your identity or how to reach you -- even though we assign a cookie to your computer. 

Alliance partners, sponsors and advertisers on our site have the ability to assign a different cookie to you, a process that we do not control. Still, since cookies cannot be used to identify you in any way, advertisers will never know who you are, unless you tell them, and we will never give them your personal information.

**DO YOU SELL OR SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT ME WITH OTHER COMPANIES?**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

We gather your personal information primarily so we can offer you compelling and easily accessible content. We use "traffic reports" (reports about the Web sites that send people to this site) so that we can choose the best places to reach people who are interested in shopping online. 

We **never** share or sell e-mail addresses to anyone. 

We occasionally make our customer names and postal mailing addresses available to other reputable companies whose products might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these mailings, please copy your catalog mailing label exactly and send to: 

> **Mail Preference Service**  
>  **Frederick's of Hollywood**

Companies that place advertisements on our site and our alliance partners' sites may collect information about you when you view or click on their ads. These companies have their own policies and practices concerning online privacy. We recommend that you read all advertisers' and alliance partners' privacy policies, which are found on their sites.
