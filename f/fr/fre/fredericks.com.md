**CAN SOMEONE GET MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND RUN UP HUGE CHARGES UNDER MY NAME?**

The simple answer is no. The credit card information you provide at Fredericks.com is encrypted and secure. Frederick's uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. SSL technology is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our Web site's servers.

**WHEN I VISIT YOUR WEB SITE, WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU COLLECT ABOUT ME?**

At fredericks.com, your privacy and security are two of our highest priorities. We never collect any personal information about you unless you request a service that requires it. Then, we only ask for the specific information that is needed to satisfy your request. Any information you do provide is kept in the strictest confidence. So are all of your transactions on our Web site. The only profile or demographic information used is in summary reports. (A summary report, for instance, may state "100,000 people clicked on image_123 and, of those people, 60 percent were between the ages of 18 and 26.")   


We may provide your personal and financial information to other reputable companies whose products or services might be of interest to you if you provide prior consent to the exchange of the information. 

One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this Web site is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Currently, you will have to provide the information listed below in order to take advantage of the following services:   
 

  * **Catalog Requests** Naturally, we need a name and an address to send the catalog to. Plus a contact - phone or e-mail - in case the address is wrong. We occasionally make our customer names and postal mailing addresses available to other reputable companies whose products might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these mailings, please copy your catalog mailing label exactly and send to:

**HOW DOES FREDERICKS.COM KEEP TRACK OF ME AS I MOVE THROUGH YOUR WEB SITE?**

In the original design for the Web, there was no way for a Web site to know whether one page request was connected to another. For most sites, this is fine. In an information only site, for example, each article is independent of the others. Visitors see what they want, then leave. 

For fredericks.com and others selling on the Internet, this is a real problem. We want you to be able to select several products before purchasing them. We want the selection process and the checkout process to span more than one page. In other words, we need a way of keeping track of Web site _sessions_ rather than merely page requests. 

The way fredericks.com deals with this is with a "cookie" The cookie contains absolutely no personal information about you. It is completely unique to each user.The sole purpose is to enable us to know that the person who added the H2O Water Bra to their basket is the same person as the one who wants the marabou baby doll.

**DOES FREDERICKS.COM USE COOKIES?**

A cookie is a small data file that most Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID, which the site can use to track which pages on the site you've visited. By themselves, cookies can't be used to identify individuals. fredericks.com uses cookies to help keep track of your preferences so that we can tailor your shopping experience to better suit your needs. We also use cookies to monitor traffic patterns on our site, to let us know whether you've visited our site in the past, and to determine whether you came to our site from a particular Internet link or sponsored advertisement. If you disable the use of cookies on your browser, your access to fredericks.com is not possible. Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know your identity or how to reach you -- even though we assign a cookie to your computer. 

Alliance partners, sponsors and advertisers on our site have the ability to assign a different cookie to you, a process that we do not control. Still, since cookies cannot be used to identify you in any way, advertisers will never know who you are, unless you tell them, and we will never give them your personal information.
