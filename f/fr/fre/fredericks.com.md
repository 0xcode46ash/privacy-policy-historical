**Is it safe to order on-line?**

Ordering with us on-line is just as safe as any other type of credit card transaction you may make, whether it is in a store or over the phone. 

Our on-line ordering system is provided by Yahoo!, using industry standard SSL encryption. When you enter your credit card number, it is transmitted in an encrypted (scrambled) form to Yahoo!. While it is stored with Yahoo! and when it is transmitted to us, it is also encrypted. We store your information on a computer that is not connected to any outside network.

**Do you collect information about me that I don't know about?**

Frederick's of Hollywood does not collect any personal information about you, including your email address, unless you supply it (ex. when you place an order, request a catalog, etc.). 

The information we may collect is technical, such as your IP address, page visits, originating server, and/or software version. We only summarize this information to assist us in site design and product offerings.
