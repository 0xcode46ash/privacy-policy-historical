User may uninstall the Application during the 14-trial without being charge. No refund will be given once user has paid for an application unless the Application(s) has a significant error. Please see our Refund Policy for further information. Multiple Applications purchased on the same day will be billed together.

Renewed subscription(s) will be billed on first day of purchase and then automatically billed again on a recurring monthly or annual basis. Freedcamp will only store saved information on uninstall Application up to 60 days. It is the user’s responsibility to renew their Applications before 60-day period in order to retrieve all stored data.

## Storage Sales

There are two ways in which Users may upgrade or purchase additional storage by:

  1. Clicking on the drop down menu located at the top right corner of the header. There will be an option to choose “Storage Updates” which will take Users to the Manage Storage page.
  2. If Users are in the Marketplace, Users may click the “Upgrade Storage” tab on the top right corner which will also take Users to the Manage Storage page.



Freedcamp offers 5 level of paid Storage Plans: **Basic** 1.00GB, **More** 5.00GB, **Plus** 10.00GB, **Premium** 15.00GB, and **Unlimited**. Each plan will have a monthly or yearly subscription plan. Users will be billed for storage immediately upon purchase and will be billed again on the same date for all following months or year. If users first purchased a Basic Plan($2.49/GB) and decided to upgrade to a More Plan($7.99/GB), users will be billed the prorated amount for the More plan. The prorated amount is determined by difference in price and remaining time before the next billing date. Upon receipt of payment, user will immediately see an increase in their storage capacity. Users will then be billed the new Storage Plan amount on the next billing date. If users decides to downgrade from a More Plan to a Basic Plan, users will be automatically refunded the prorated amount. The storage amount will be immediately reduced and user will be billed the new lower Storage Plan price on the next billing date. Users may not mix or combine different Storage Plans. Freedcamp only offers fixed storage updates, therefore Users will have to choose one specific plan.

You agree to pay for all products purchased through Freedcamp’s Marketplace. Freedcamp, may charge your account automatically every month or year for the continual use of the application and/or storage plans. Any nonpayment by the User will result in the expiration and unavailability of application(s) until payment resumes. (Please see **Freedcamp’s Rights**  for further detail regarding nonpayment). YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING FREEDCAMP WITH A VALID CREDIT/DEBIT CARD OR PAYPAL ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. All monthly fees will be billed to the credit/debit card account Users designated during the registration process. Users may make updates to their payment information by choosing “My Account” under the drop down menu in the top right corner and then choose the “billing” option. It is Users’ responsibility to stop the monthly payments if you no longer wish to subscribe to the Applications and/or Storage plans. You may contact Freedcamp through our Contact Links regarding any payment changes.

Your total price will be the cost of the applications, plus any applicable fees and sales tax. We will only charge sales tax in states where digital goods are taxable.

## Refund and Cancelation Policy

Freedcamp will not offer a full refund unless major problems and bugs exist within our applications and are not fixed in a timely manner. It is Users’ responsibility to inform Freedcamp of any application errors. User may submit a request for refund by stating out the appropriate grounds for a refund. Freedcamp will consider each individual refund request but is not obligated to grant User(s) a refund just based on the submission of a request. YOU MAY NOT REQUEST A REFUND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED THE APPLICATIONS FOR OVER 2 WEEKS AFTER MAKING PAYMENT. Freedcamp does not offer refunds for storage payments.

Freedcamp’s billing system requires Users to pay for the Application and Storage in advance and therefore User must cancel the Application Subscription(s) before the next billing cycle date in order to avoid the automatic recurring charges. If user cancels subscription at any time before the next billing cycle, user will still be able to use the Application until the next billing cycle date. See example below for further information.

Ex. 3

User first purchases a Google drive Application for $2.99 on 9/1/2015. User is first given a 14-day trial period and then purchased a monthly subscription on 9/15/2015. User will be first charged $2.99 on 9/15/2015 and then again on 10/15/2015. If, however, User cancels subscription on 10/9/2015, user will not be billed on 10/15/2015 and User will still have access to the Application until 10/15/2015. No refund will be granted unless the Application’s error is due to Freedcamp.

## Freedcamp’s Rights

Freedcamp, INC. reserves the right to:

  1. Close accounts and request alternative forms of payments if current forms of payment is fraudulently obtained or used on Freedcamp’s Marketplace.
  2. Cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Terms of Sales, or we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.



If billing error occurs, on date of billing, due to: a) Credit/Debit card decline, b) misrepresented financial information, or c) User Negligence, then User will be immediately notified via email of payment error on date of billing. User will then have 24 hours to make payment **.** To update billing information please visit [Billing Tab](https://freedcamp.com/manage/account#billing) on the My Account page. **** Freedcamp reserves the right to stop all functionality of any unpaid Application until payment is received. Any stored Application data will be saved for 60 days after the expiration period. If User eventually resumes payment within those 60 days, all saved Application data will be restored. If no payment is received during the 60 day, all Application data will be deleted.  It is the User’s responsibility to meet all financial obligations and make prompt payments within the set time period. Late payment made during the 24 hour time limit will not alter the billing date for the following months. Renewed subscription payments made after an Application has been suspended will set a new billing date and User will be automatically billed on the new payment date for all following months. Please see examples below.

Ex. 4.

User first purchases a $12.99 CRM Application on 7/1/2015. User is given a 14-day trial period and then purchased monthly subscription on 7/15/2015. The next billing date will occur on 8/15/2015. If no payment is made on 8/15/2014, User will immediately receive an email regarding the payment error. User will be given 24 hours to make the proper payments. If User finally makes a payment on 8/16/2014, User will still be able to use the Application and will be billed again on 9/15/2015.

If User fails to make payment within the 24 hour period, Freedcamp will stop all functionality of the Application until payment is received. If User eventually pays on 9/25/2015, Freedcamp will resume the functionality of the Application and the next billing date will now be on 10/25/2015 instead.
