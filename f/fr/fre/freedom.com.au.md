When used in this privacy policy, the term “Personal Information” has the meaning given to it in the Act.  Generally, it includes any information that can be used to personally identify you.  This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and occupation.  If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

## Access and correction

There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.

If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it.  We will consider if the information requires amendment.  If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment then we will add a note to the personal information stating you disagree with it.
