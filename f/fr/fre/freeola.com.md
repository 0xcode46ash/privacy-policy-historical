Your details specifically supplied to us for the purpose of a domain registration, a transaction or a service may be securely transmitted to official registrars, regulated bankers or service providers where we deem it necessary to fulfil your requirements. It is the practice of domain registration authorities to publish domain registration details (in the WHOIS). For some domain types you may opt-out of the WHOIS database using the Get Dotted Domains [WHOIS Privacy Protection](http://getdotted.com/domain-privacy/) service.

This allows you to decide which addresses are to receive alerts, and whether to opt into Freeola Bulletins. 

Essential alerts, such as domain expiry reminders, will be sent to your login e-mail address regardless of your other settings. We cannot guarantee that you will receive these, but the same information is listed within your MyFreeola account.
