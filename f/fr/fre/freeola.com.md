# Freeola Privacy Policy

Your e-mail address is safe with us. We will not sell your e-mail address or any other personal information to any other companies. Your details specifically supplied to us for the purpose of a domain registration, a transaction or a service may be securely transmitted to official registrars, regulated bankers or service providers where we deem it necessary to fulfil your requirements. It is the practice of domain registration authorities to publish domain registration details (in the WHOIS). For some domain types you may opt-out of the WHOIS database using the Get Dotted Domains [WHOIS Privacy Protection](http://getdotted.com/domain-privacy/) service. 

"Get Dotted" is a division of Freeola Limited. All of your settings for Freeola Internet and Get Dotted Domains are held in your MyFreeola account which provides powerful features and allows instant changes to your settings. 

Your [MyFreeola Contact and Login Details](https://secure.freeola.com/myfreeola-control-panel/contact.php) can be changed from within your MyFreeola account. 

Your [E-mail Alerts and Subscriptions](https://secure.freeola.com/myfreeola-control-panel/contact-admin.php) settings, for your login e-mail address and any other email addresses provided for your use by Freeola, can be changed from within your MyFreeola account. This allows you to decide which addresses are to receive alerts, and whether to opt into Freeola Bulletins. 

Essential alerts, such as domain expiry reminders, will be sent to your login e-mail address regardless of your other settings. We cannot guarantee that you will receive these, but the same information is listed within your MyFreeola account. 

If you establish a [Chat & Gaming Profile](https://secure.freeola.com/myfreeola-control-panel/interactive_profile_setup.php), to enable you to take part in our competitions and contribute to our interactive sites, then this information will be made available to the public, but this does not include your real name or contact details. 

The Freeola family of websites, in common with the practice of most major internet sites, issues non-intrusive browser cookies (small pieces of text which are stored temporarily on your computer to enable or enhance your online experience). The pages on our websites may collect anonymous analytical tracking data and may display third-party advertisements which lead to external websites. Freeola is not responsible for the content or practices of any advertised websites and further information and advice, including opt-outs, can be found at <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html>. 

Further information about Freeola's privacy policy is outlined as part of our General Terms & Conditions. Our Terms & Conditions are available to view or download in PDF format and can be found at <http://freeola.com/legal/terms.php>.
