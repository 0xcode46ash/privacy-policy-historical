Information Collection and Use

FreeTaxUSA.com is the sole owner of the information collected on www.FreeTaxUSA.com. Information is collected in order for taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their tax returns. Tax return information is only disclosed to appropriate government and financial institutions in order to file tax returns and comply with Internal Revenue Service requirements. The data collected includes everything that is needed to prepare a tax return, such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, mailing address, e-mail address, and any tax-related information such as Form W-2s and Form 1099s. If a purchase is made, credit card information for a credit card payment or bank account information for an e-check payment will be gathered.

All personally identifiable information gathered during account creation and during the use of the application to prepare taxes is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

At times, we may offer a referral service so that you can tell a friend about our products. We will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. FreeTaxUSA.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the FreeTaxUSA.com web site. A session ID cookie is used as an additional layer of security to maintain your session while you are logged into your account. Once a user closes the browser or clicks the "Logout" link, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies are also used to track affiliate referrals and when collecting analytical data about usage on our site or the effectiveness of our emails. This information is used in aggregate and for the purpose of improving the site, it does not contain personally identifiable information. 

We may use clear-gifs/web beacons in our HTML-based e-mails to monitor the effectiveness of our communication efforts. Links within email may contain campaign tracking codes to measure traffic in aggregate. The data collected will be anonymous and will not be used to collect any personally identifiable information. 

Third-Party Advertising

No third-party advertising appears on the FreeTaxUSA.com web site.

Usage Information

Like most web sites, FreeTaxUSA.com uses log files and analytical software to track website usage. The information collected may include IP addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform types, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for use in improving the site.

Communications from FreeTaxUSA.com

Your contact information (e-mail address) may be used to keep you updated on the status of your return, remind you of important dates on the tax calendar, resolve any problems with transmission of your tax return, and provide a confirmation of credit card or direct-debit payments. If you e-file your tax return, an e-mail will be sent to you stating whether the IRS has accepted or rejected your e-filed tax return. If problems occur with the transmission of your tax return, a customer support e-mail may be sent out to explain the problem. FreeTaxUSA.com also sends a confirmation e-mail to serve as a receipt when a taxpayer uses a credit card or checking/savings account to pay for the FreeTaxUSA.com fee.

FreeTaxUSA.com will not use your information to market any third party product or service. Occasionally, FreeTaxUSA.com will send out tax information or promotional material dealing with our products. These are considered optional communications and you as the recipient can specify whether or not you wish to receive this type of communication. This can be done while creating your account, by using the "Edit User Profile" portion of the application after logging in, by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of every optional email or by following the instructions found at the following link:  [http://www.FreeTaxUSA.com/unsubscribe.jsp](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.jsp;jsessionid=FAA4EB63138EC7907E34377C33B66963.pLandE05). 

Service Announcements

On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, FreeTaxUSA.com might send users a notification via e-mail.

Customer Service

Customer support for FreeTaxUSA.com is provided through our tax application or e-mail. When a customer support request is received, we will reply via the customer support portion of the application or e-mail. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to use our service, you may correct, update or delete it by logging into your account and making any changes. However, once the IRS accepts your e-filed tax return, no changes can be made to your account that would change any of the information on the tax return.

Legal Disclosures

Though every effort is made to preserve user privacy, FreeTaxUSA.com may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.

Credit Card Processing

If during the use of our application you order a product that requires payment, your credit card or direct-debit payment will be processed by a payment processing company. The payment processing companies that we use do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. No credit card information will be collected unless there is a payment due. FreeTaxUSA.com does not store any credit card information. Your credit card data is only used to process your payment.

Business Transitions

In the event FreeTaxUSA.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, the personal information of users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified, via e-mail and/or through a prominent notice on the FreeTaxUSA.com web site, 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

Security

FreeTaxUSA.com maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, it is protected both online and offline. FreeTaxUSA.com uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect all sensitive information. SSL technology is the most commonly-used method on the Internet to safely transmit data. Access to your personal information is protected by a password, of your choosing, in order to maintain security for your account. Only you, or someone with whom you share your password, can access your account to make changes to your return or account information. 

Along with using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take great care to protect user information offline. The FreeTaxUSA.com servers are located in a secure data storage facility with strict security measures and procedures in place. All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to only key employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (Example: the customer service representative manager). Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on the security and privacy practices of FreeTaxUSA.com. Before every tax season, as well as any time new policies are added, employees of FreeTaxUSA.com are notified and/or reminded about the importance placed on privacy, and what they can do to ensure the security of user information. 

If you have any further questions about the security at FreeTaxUSA.com, you can send an email to [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com). _No support questions will be answered from this email address._

Notification of Changes

If during the use of our application you order a product that requires payment, your credit card or direct-debit payment will be processed by a payment processing company. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
