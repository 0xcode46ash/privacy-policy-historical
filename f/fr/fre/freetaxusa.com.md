Privacy Statement  
  
---  
  
  
[](https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.FreeTaxUSA.com) FreeTaxUSA treats your financial and personal information as confidential and will not sell or rent any information. FreeTaxUSA is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site. This privacy statement covers the [www.freetaxusa.com](http://www.freetaxusa.com/) web site. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose the information practices of FreeTaxUSA and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@freetaxusa.com) by e-mail.

TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the FreeTaxUSA web site to resolve your concerns.   
  
  
Information Collection and Use  
  
  
FreeTaxUSA is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.freetaxusa.com](http://www.freetaxusa.com/). Information is collected in order for taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their tax returns. Tax return information is only disclosed to appropriate government and financial institutions in order to file tax returns and comply with Internal Revenue Service transmission requirements. FreeTaxUSA will not use your information to market any other type of product or service. Your contact information (e-mail address) may be used to keep you updated on the status of your return, to resolve any problems with transmission of your tax return, and to remind you of important dates on the tax calendar. 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the FreeTaxUSA web site. A session ID cookie is used as an additional layer of security to maintain your session while you are logged into your account. Once a user closes the browser or clicks the "Logout" link, the cookie simply terminates. Some of our business partners that are affiliate websites use cookies on our site to track users that have reached our web site through one of the affiliate websites. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for affiliate tracking.   
  
  
Third Party Advertising  
  
  
No third-party advertising appears on the FreeTaxUSA web site.   
  
  
Log Files  
  
  
Like most standard web sites, FreeTaxUSA uses log files. These include IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.   
  
  
Communications from FreeTaxUSA  
  
  
Your contact information may be used to keep you updated on the status of your return, to resolve any problems with transmission of your tax return, and to provide a confirmation of credit card or direct-debit payments. If you e-file your tax return, an e-mail will be sent to you stating whether the IRS has accepted or rejected your e-filed tax return. If problems occur with the transmission of your tax return, a customer support e-mail may be sent out to explain the problem. FreeTaxUSA also sends a confirmation e-mail to serve as a receipt when a taxpayer uses a credit card or checking/savings account to pay for the FreeTaxUSA fee.   
  
  
Service Announcements  
  
  
On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, FreeTaxUSA might send users a notification via e-mail.   
  
  
Customer Service  
  
  
Customer support for FreeTaxUSA is provided through e-mail. So, when a customer support request is received, we will reply via e-mail.   
  
  
Legal Disclosures  
  
  
Though every effort is made to preserve user privacy, FreeTaxUSA may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.   
  
  
Credit Card Processing  
  
  
If you do not qualify for free tax preparation and e-filing, your credit card or direct-debit payment will be processed by an outside payment processing company. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.   
  
  
Business Transitions  
  
  
In the event FreeTaxUSA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, the personal information of users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified, via e-mail and through a prominent notice on the FreeTaxUSA web site, 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.   
  
  
Security  
  
  
FreeTaxUSA takes every precaution to protect the information of our users. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, it is protected both on-line and off-line. FreeTaxUSA uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect all sensitive information. SSL technology is the most commonly-used method on the internet to safely transmit data. Access to your personal information is protected by a password, of your choosing, in order to maintain security for your account. Only you, or someone with whom you share your password, can access your account to make changes to your return or account information. 

Along with using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. The FreeTaxUSA servers are located in a secure data storage facility with strict security measures and procedures in place. All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to only key employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (Example: the customer service representative manager). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on the security and privacy practices of FreeTaxUSA. Before every tax season, as well as any time new policies are added, employees of FreeTaxUSA are notified and/or reminded about the importance placed on privacy, and what they can do to ensure the security of user information. 

If you have any further questions about the security at FreeTaxUSA, you can send an e-mail to [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@freetaxusa.com). _No  support questions will be answered from this e-mail address_.   
  
  
Notification of Changes  
  
  
If FreeTaxUSA decides to use personally identifiable information of the user in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via posting a prominent notice on our site 30 days prior to implementing the new privacy practice. Users will have a choice as to whether or not their information is used in this different manner.
