If a user contacts Tickifieds via email, a record of that correspondence may also be stored.

Tickifieds may place a cookie in the browser files of a user's computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our users.

Tickifieds may provide your information to law enforcement to aid in their investigations of illegal or fraudulent postings. If Tickifieds sells part or all of its business, personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the purchaser.

**4\. How do we treat sensitive information?**

"Sensitive Information" means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religion, membership of a trade union or professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health.

Tickifieds may use and disclose sensitive information only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose or as allowed by law unless you have agreed otherwise.

Tickifieds protects the personal information it holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by various means including password access and secure servers. Only the administrators of Tickifieds and the user have access to that user's personal information. We recommend that users do not disclose their password to anyone.
