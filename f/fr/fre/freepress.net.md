# Privacy and Copyright Policies | Free Press

Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as that of our members and activists. In fact, both organizations are supporters of enhanced protections for all consumers' electronic and Internet privacy.

In this policy, "Free Press" refers to both Free Press and Free Press Action Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers and consultants.

In general, Free Press (and our software partners) treats your contact information as private and confidential. Free Press will not typically give, sell, rent, exchange or otherwise share your information with anyone else without your prior consent.

We will notify users of updates to this policy by noting the date of new changes directly below this statement.

This policy was last amended April 10, 2012.  
Policy effective May 1, 2003. 

**Website Policies**  
Free Press and third-party vendor servers may record the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors and to improve the site. We do not connect this information to your name or identity, and we do not retain this information permanently.

Information that is not provided with the express intent of subscription, ordering, membership or donation will not be captured for use in other communications unless otherwise noted. This includes any email address supplied in forwarding news articles or encouraging others to participate in online activism. See below for details on how we treat information provided in membership and ordering contexts.

We (and our vendors) make limited use of "cookies" on this site primarily for convenience features such as auto login, discussion boards and polls. These cookies are typically deleted as soon as reasonably possible.

**External Links**  
Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund have not reviewed all of the sites linked to this site and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any off-site pages or any other sites linked to this site, whether or not they are affiliated with Free Press or the Free Press Action Fund. Such linked sites are for your convenience only and you access them at your own risk. Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or functioning of any such link. That another website is linked to our site does not constitute endorsement by Free Press or the Free Press Action Fund of the owner of the other site, the content of its site or its products or services.

**Electronic Mailing List Policies**  
Free Press offers several electronic mailing lists. If you choose to subscribe to any of these lists, we may ask for personal information such as your name, zip code and email address. This information is used strictly to manage our lists (for example, we may use your zip code for a targeted mailing on an issue affecting your area). We do not sell, rent or share our electronic mailing lists.

There are a number of ways to subscribe to Free Press electronic mailing lists, including submitting a form at our website, opting in when you engage in online or offline activism or mailing or completing a sign-up form from a paper petition, brochure or flier. When you subscribe, you will typically receive a confirmation message welcoming you.

You can unsubscribe from any of our lists at any time. In the event you wish to update, delete or otherwise make changes to your relationship with us, or remove yourself entirely from our list(s), [click here](http://act2.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_freepress/).

Lists maintained by Free Press for electronic mailings are exclusively "opt-in" lists. We do not purchase information from third-party sources or gather personal data from the Web (known as spidering) for inclusion in our ongoing email lists.

**Online Activism**  
Our website offers many ways to engage in online activism. Many of these tools are hosted and administered by a third party (currently ActionKit). When you provide personal information in the context of signing a petition or engaging in other actions, that personal information may be stored on our server(s) and/or ActionKit's server(s). If you choose to join a mailing list or become a member at the same time you participate in an online action, your relevant information will be kept and used for those other purposes. We may deliver petitions and surveys you've completed to the president, federal and state legislators, or federal agencies like the FCC. We ask for your address so we can deliver your message to the appropriate office, and may include information such as your name, town or city and state in these deliveries.

ActionKit strictly adheres to policies preventing unauthorized access to your personal information and will not make such information available to anyone outside of Free Press or ActionKit (unless legally compelled to do so). 

**Free Press Action Fund Membership**  
The Free Press Action Fund is committed to maintaining the trust and security of all of its financial supporters. We collect personal information including the email and mailing addresses that members provide. We might use this information for online and print mailings to keep you informed about our programs and occasionally to ask for additional financial support. You can opt out at any time. To opt out of email communication, [click here](http://act2.freepress.net/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_freepress/). 

To opt out of receiving print mailings, please call us toll-free at 877-888-1533, ext. 504, or email [Amy Altwarg](https://web.archive.org/mailconvert.php?addr=aaltwarg).

On occasion the Free Press Action Fund shares and/or exchanges its membership lists with reputable nonprofit organizations and businesses which we believe may be of interest to our members. Our ability to share your name and address with other entities helps us build our membership base and further the media reform movement. If you do not wish your contact information to be exchanged, please call us toll-free at 877-888-1533, ext. 504, or email [Amy Altwarg](https://web.archive.org/mailconvert.php?addr=aaltwarg).

All financial data is collected via a secure Web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

**Online and Phone Orders for Materials**  
Information provided to us in the course of placing an order for educational materials, activist toolkits, media reform promotional materials or other materials offered by Free Press (whether or not the materials are offered at a cost) may be retained for use in future communications, such as membership drives, or when we unveil similar offerings that we believe may be of interest to you. This information will not be given, sold, rented, shared or otherwise provided to anyone else without your prior consent (except when compelled by law â€” see below).

All financial data is collected via a secure web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

**Compelled Disclosure**  
If we are required by law to disclose any information that you have provided us, we will attempt to give you notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made, in order to give you an opportunity to object. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
