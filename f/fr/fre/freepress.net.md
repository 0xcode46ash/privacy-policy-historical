# Free Press : Privacy Policy

The Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as well as our members and activists. In fact, both organizations are supporters of enhanced protections for all consumers' electronic and internet privacy.

In this policy "Free Press" refers to Free Press and Free Press Action Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers and consultants.

In general Free Press treats your contact information as private and confidential. Free Press will not give, sell, rent, exchange or otherwise provide your information with anyone else without your prior consent (except when compelled by law — see below).

## Website Policy

Free Press servers may record the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. We do not connect this information to your name or identity, and we periodically delete this information from the server.

Information that is not provided with the express intent of subscription, ordering, membership or donation is not saved and will not be captured for use in other communications. This includes any email address supplied in forwarding news articles or encouraging others to participate in online activism. See below for details on how we treat information provided in membership and ordering contexts. 

We do not use "cookies" on this site.

## Mailing List Policies

Free Press offers several electronic mailing lists. If you choose to subscribe to any of these lists, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, zip code, and email address. This information is used strictly to manage our lists (for example, we may use your zipcode for a targeted mailing on an issue affecting your area), and will be used exclusively for the purpose of sending you email from Free Press. You will not be contacted in any other way, nor will your information be offered to a third-party. **We do not sell, rent or share our mailing lists.**

There are a number of ways to subscribe to Free Press mailing lists, including submitting a form at our website, opting in when you engage in online activism, or mailing a sign-up form from a brochure or flier. When you subscribe, you will typically receive a confirmation message welcoming you.

You can unsubscribe from any of our lists at any time. In the event you wish to update or delete an email address in our possession at any time for any reason, please contact [info(AT)freepress.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050005id_/http%3A//www.freepress.net/mailconvert.php?addr=info) to make those changes.

E-Activist subscribers can manually remove themselves from that list [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050005id_/http%3A//www.freepress.net/action/unsub.php). Likewise, headlines subscribers can do so [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050005id_/http%3A//www.freepress.net/mailman/listinfo/freepress_headlines).

## Activism

Our website offers many ways to engage in online activism. All of these offerings are presently administered by Free Press; no third parties are involved.

When you provide personal information in the context of signing a petition or other actions, that personal information is stored on our server and is delivered to the final recipient(s) (typically your elected officials). We will not use information provided on these forms to contact you in the future. However, if you choose to join a mailing list or become a member at the same time you participate in an online action, your relevant information will be kept and used for those other purposes.

* * *

## Membership and Orders

Free Press will never share or use personal information provided in the course of becoming a member of the Action Fund for any reason other than to manage your membership or contribution, such as contacting you to request that you renew your membership.

We do not retain credit card information supplied to us. All financial data is collected via a secure web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times.

Information provided to us in the course of placing an order for materials (free or otherwise) may be retained for use in future communications, such as membership dirves or when we unveil similar offerings that we believe may be of interest to you. This information will not be given, sold, rented, shared or otherwise provided to anyone else without your prior consent (except when compelled by law — see below).

* * *

## Compelled Disclosure

If we are required by law to disclose any information that you have provided us, we will attempt to give you notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made, in order to give you an opportunity to object. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
