# Free Press : Privacy Policy

Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our Web site, as well as our members and activists. In fact, both organizations are supporters of enhanced protections for all consumers’ electronic and Internet privacy.

In this policy, “Free Press” refers to both Free Press and Free Press Action Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers and consultants.

In general, Free Press (and our software partners) treats your contact information as private and confidential. Free Press will not typically give, sell, rent, exchange or otherwise provide your information with anyone else without your prior consent.

We will notify users of updates to this policy by noting the date of new changes directly below this statement.  

_This policy was last amended March 16, 2007._

_Policy effective May 1, 2003.  _

## Web Site Policy

Free Press servers may record the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. 

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. We do not connect this information to your name or identity, and we periodically delete this information from the server. 

Information that is not provided with the express intent of subscription, ordering, membership or donation will not be captured for use in other communications. This includes any email address supplied in forwarding news articles or encouraging others to participate in online activism. See below for details on how we treat information provided in membership and ordering contexts. 

We make limited use of “cookies” on this site for convenience features such as auto-login, discussion boards and polls. These cookies are only accessible within freepress.net and are typically deleted as soon as possible. 

## Electronic Mailing List Policies

Free Press offers several electronic mailing lists. If you choose to subscribe to any of these lists, we may ask for personal information, such as your name, zip code, and email address. This information is used strictly to manage our lists (for example, we may use your zip code for a targeted mailing on an issue affecting your area). **We do not sell, rent or share our electronic mailing lists.**

There are a number of ways to subscribe to Free Press electronic mailing lists, including submitting a form at our Web site, opting in when you engage in online activism, or mailing a sign-up form from a brochure or flier. When you subscribe, you will typically receive a confirmation message welcoming you.

You can unsubscribe from any of our lists at any time. E-Activist subscribers can manually remove themselves from that list [here](http://www.freepress.net/action/unsub.php). Likewise, headlines subscribers can do so [here](http://www.freepress.net/mailman/listinfo/freepress_headlines). In the event you wish to update, delete or otherwise make changes to your relationship with us, or otherwise make changes to your relationship with us, visit .<http://action.freepress.net/freepress/smp.html>.

Lists maintained by Free Press for electronic mailings are exclusively “opt-in” lists. We do not purchase information from third-party sources or gather personal data from the web (known as spidering) for inclusion in our ongoing e-mail lists.

## Activism

Our Web site offers many ways to engage in online activism. Many of these tools are hosted and administered by a third party (currently GetActive Software, Inc.). When you provide personal information in the context of signing a petition or other actions, that personal information may be stored on our server(s) and/or GetActive’s server(s). If you choose to join a mailing list or become a member at the same time you participate in an online action, your relevant information will be kept and used for those other purposes. GetActive strictly adheres to policies preventing unauthorized access to your personal information and will not make such information available to anyone outside of Free Press or GetActive (unless legally compelled to do so). 

## Free Press Action Fund Membership

The Free Press Action Fund is committed to maintaining the trust and security of all of its financial supporters. We do collect personal information including the email and mailing address that members provide. We might use this information for print and online mailings to you in the future. Our goal is to keep you informed about our programs and occasionally ask for additional financial support. You may opt out of receiving this correspondence at any time. 

On occasion, the Free Press Action Fund shares and/or exchanges our membership lists with reputable non-profit organizations and businesseswhich we believe may be of interest to our members. Our ability to share your name with other entities helps us build our membership base and further the media reform movement. If you do not wish to have your personal data shared in this manner, you may optout at any time. 

We do not retain credit card information. All financial data is collected via a secure web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times. 

## Online and Phone Orders for Materials

Information provided to us in the course of placing an order for educational materials, activist toolkits, media reform promotional materials, or other materials offered by Free Press (whether or not the materials are offered at a cost) may be retained for use in future communications, such as membership drives, or when we unveil similar offerings that we believe may be of interest to you. This information will not be given, sold, rented, shared or otherwise provided to anyone else without your prior consent (except when compelled by law — see below). 

We do not retain credit card information. All financial data is collected via a secure web connection, and is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures at all times. 

## Compelled Disclosure

If we are required by law to disclose any information that you have provided us, we will attempt to give you notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made, in order to give you an opportunity to object. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.
