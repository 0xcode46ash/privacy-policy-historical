## Cookies

Fruition.net uses Cookies to allow visitors to access secure areas of a website or to monitor the flow of traffic on a website to ensure reliable, consistent service, and to deliver the best user experience. Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website. Fruition uses “temporary cookies” on some parts of fruition.net, and such temporary cookies expire upon the end of the browsing session. If a user registers to use fruition.net as a customized portal, Fruition uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization. 

The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however, may lead to loss of functionality on those fruition.net pages requiring cookies to function fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of fruition.net, Fruition will create a cookie that contains the user’s unique identifier and indicator for any custom content modules requested. 

## Web Bugs (a/k/a Web Beacons)

fruition.net does not use web bugs on its web pages or in any html e-mail generated by use of the portal, or otherwise sent from fruition.net, for any purpose other than to identify site performance needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by fruition.net’s visitors, and to generally add and improve services offered on fruition.net. 

## Children

No applications on fruition.net specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of fruition.net should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to fruition.net by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as information given by an adult. 

Fruition strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor in Internet use by minors. Therefore, fruition.net asks parents to guide their minor children when children are asked to provide any personal information online. fruition.net further asks that children ask for and receive their parent’s permission before providing any information online.

## Third Party Links

fruition.net provides links to, and may be linked from or to other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s) or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Nor does any link between fruition.net and a third-party website imply sponsorship of such website, or the creator of such website.
