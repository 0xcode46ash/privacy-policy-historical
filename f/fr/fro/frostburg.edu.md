# Privacy & FSU's Web Site

| 

  
Maryland law mandates that State agencies such as Frostburg State University shall not create personal records unless the need for the information is clearly established and that personal records shall be relevant to the purposes, for which they are collected, be accurate and current, and not be obtained by fraudulent means. 

FSU is committed to providing the necessary privacy information to allow the visitor to make informed choices about collection and use of their personal information. When personal information is requested from the site visitor, FSU will strive to advise the visitor regarding the purposes for which the information is collected; the consequences to the visitor for refusing to provide the personal information; the visitorâ€™s right to inspect and correct personal records; whether the information is generally available for public inspection; and whether the information is made available to other entities.
