Our company recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Identifiying Information about you as a user of our Web site. We consider the following to be Personal Identifying Information: your name, address, phone number, date of birth, job, personal interests, credit card information. This Web site does not collect Personal Identifying Information about a user except for information that is voluntarily provided to our Company so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes. (For example, when the user posts a message to a bulletin board or makes an online purchase, we need to retain certain Personal Identifying Information on the Web site in order to respond to the order).

It will be treated confidentially within our company. Our policy is not to share this information with third parties, but we may share this information with other companies within IDG.

In addition, users should be reminded that any Personal Identifying Information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of this Web site (for example, a posting to a bulletin board or chat room) may always be collected and used by others and that there is nothing our company can do to prevent that.

This site uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages.
