# Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel Online : About Us

**Privacy Policy**

**General Information About the Privacy Policy of This Web Site**

Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel Online is maintained by Hungry Minds located at 909 3rd Avenue, New York, New York 10022. We can be reached by e-mail at [support@frommers.com](mailto:support@frommers.com).

Our company recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Identifying Information about you as a user of our Web site. We consider the following to be Personal Identifying Information: your name, address, phone number, date of birth, job, personal interests, credit card information. This Web site does not collect Personal Identifying Information about a user except for information that is voluntarily provided to our Company so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes. (For example, when the user posts a message to a bulletin board or makes an online purchase, we need to retain certain Personal Identifying Information on the Web site in order to respond to the order.) A user's Personal Identifying Information may be used by our company to help us improve the Web site, and also for our company's marketing and promotional purposes. It will be treated confidentially within our company. Our policy is not to share this information with third parties, but we may share this information with other companies within Hungry Minds.

In addition, users should be reminded that any Personal Identifying Information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of this Web site (for example, a posting to a bulletin board or chat room) may always be collected and used by others and that there is nothing our company can do to prevent that.

**Special Notice to Parents**

We have no intention of seeking Personal Identifying Information about minors who visit this Web site. The same privacy policies will apply to that information. In addition, if we can identify a user as a minor, the Personal Identifying Information will not be used for further marketing and promotion. We encourage you to ask your children to seek your permission before providing information about themselves or their family over the Internet.

**Special Notice to Kids**

Ask your parent or guardian for permission before you send any personal information over the Internet.

Our privacy policies are under frequent review. If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy, you may contact us by e-mail at [support@frommers.com](mailto:support@frommers.com).
