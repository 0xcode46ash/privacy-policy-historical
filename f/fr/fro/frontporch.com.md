# Front Porch Communications - Corporate (Privacy Statement)

**Privacy Statement**

Front Porch Communications, Inc. is dedicated to the protection of privacy on the Internet. Our **PorchLight** ™ services are designed in such a way that no individually distinctive user information is ever requested by us, transferred to us, or disseminated by us, which means that Front Porch does not obtain any names, addresses, telephone numbers, gender, age or credit card information under any circumstances.

Protecting privacy is one of our core business principles, and we have rigorously structured our technology to ensure the protection of user privacy. ISPs place our hardware equipment, known as the **PorchLight** ™, on their network to utilize our services. The **PorchLight** ™ monitors the online usage of an ISP's subscribers. Each subscriber is identified only by a random number and zip code. At no time is any personal user information transferred to our offices by our products or services, nor do our products or services acquire or learn this information. We strongly believe in the privacy of the user and have gone to great lengths to create a program that protects this privacy.

Our technology utilizes 1024-bit encryption to transfer aggregated online usage data to our offices, which are then used for marketing and advertising purposes. We believe that our targeted advertising methodology, based on the 100% accurate viewing trends, is less intrusive and more effective than other traditional means of advertising.

Our technology also allows an ISP to better communicate with its valued subscribers. The subscriber may notice additional screens or messages as part of their Internet experience; these are part of this new technology. The end result to the ISP is the ability to easily communicate system messages and alerts without relying on e-mail or web site announcements and the ability to inform users of new and exciting services.

The ISP has complete control over the level of participation of their subscribers in our services at all times. A subscriber may easily opt out of our services by simply contacting their ISP. If the subscriber is unsure of how to contact their ISP, they may contact Front Porch Customer Support via e-mail, who will send them the appropriate contact information.

As for our corporate Web site (located at [ www.frontporch.com](http://www.frontporch.com/)), only IP address information is collected so that we may better administer our site and diagnose potential problems with our servers. No personal information of any kind is collected by our Web site.
