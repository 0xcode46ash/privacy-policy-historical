## Notice of Information Collected and Disclosed

This Policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you through our Sites, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it.

In connection with your use of our Sites, we may collect the following information:

  * The domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Sites.

In order to use some of the Sites, a user may first complete the registration form. During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on the Site for which the user has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but this is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on the Site. We may use your e-mail address to contact you directly regarding services, products or information that we believe might interest you.

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. We store all information that we collect through the ordering process excluding the actual credit card number. We do NOT store credit card numbers in our database, nor is the credit card number stored at any point on our server, it is transmitted directly to Authorize.net. Please [click here](http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/) to review their privacy and security policies.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law, however, we may choose to disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to Front Gate Ticketing Solutions clients in conjunction with processing transactions on their behalf and providing services to such clients where you are a customer of the client, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other similar companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Front Gate is the owner of the information collected on the Sites; however, data collected on the marketing and merchandising sites for our clients is jointly owned by Front Gate and the respective client. Front Gate has no control or responsibility for the use of this jointly owned data by our clients and the clients can use this data as they desire without Front Gate's knowledge or permission. Please review privacy policies they post on their sites for information about their use of data.

Additionally, Front Gate may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics related to you. We may use the personal identifying information you provide to administer Sites usage and monitor traffic-levels, and to contact you regarding improvements we can make to our Sites and our services, if necessary. We also may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We partner with certain third parties to provide specific services. For example, internet connectivity, computer crime investigation, incident response, web hosting, etc. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except in conjunction with providing these services.

Finally, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law when we believe that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.

We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Front Gate restricts access to your nonpublic personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide information to you. Front Gate maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

## Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our Sites may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user; therefore, has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors and used to notify the winners and award prizes. The terms of a contest may provide, among other things that the identities of the contest winners may be made public. Survey information may also be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Sites. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Sites. However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Sites.

## Choice/Opt Out

If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you receive communications from us that you do not want to receive, you can opt-out from receiving these communications, by specifically telling us to stop sending them to you. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or emailing us at [hello@frontgatetickets.com](mailto:hello@frontgatetickets.com).

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)

We will apply the Opt-Out policies discussed above in the event we propose to disclose your information to a third party.

## Security

It should be noted that e mails and other information you send to us is not encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information. Front Gate will never ask you to submit your financial data such as your credit card account numbers, via e-mail. You should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit through the Sites may be damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or accessed by another person without your permission.

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit.

## Linked Sites

The Sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Front Gate may not be responsible for content or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.

Our Sites are not directed at children under the age of 13 and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If Front Gate obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information is immediately and permanently deleted from our records.

## Business Transitions

In the event Front Gate goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
