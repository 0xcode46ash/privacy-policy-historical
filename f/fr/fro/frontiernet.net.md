Privacy Policy

Frontier is sensitive to privacy issues with respect to the use of customer information provided to us over the Internet. We believe it is important for you to know how we handle the information about you that is received by us when you visit. Online privacy focuses mainly on the protection of "customer identifiable" information (e.g. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) that an individual expects to be kept private.

**Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure only appropriate use of information submitted, physical, electronic and managerial safeguards have been established to secure the information collected online.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**

Frontier may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys as they provide us with information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary and may be conducted by a third party. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential.

**Responses to Email Inquiries**

The return email address is used to answer email inquiries we receive. Frontier does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.Â 

**Collection of Personal Information**

We do not collect and then sell, distribute, or exchange personal information with third parties. In order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), Frontier does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
