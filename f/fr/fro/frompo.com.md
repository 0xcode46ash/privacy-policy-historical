For example, we do not exercise control over the sites that appear as search results when you use the Frompo website. When you leave the Frompo website, we encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies on all other websites that you visit.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**

We collect different information from you depending upon how you use Frompo as described below.

However, our vendors may keep your IP Address, user agent string and isolated search strings from you for longer, but they are instructed to keep this data secure.

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

Search engines, by their very nature, must use information provided by you to deliver research results. Like other search engines, our website requires sharing a minimum amount of information to function as a search engine. But, we also permit you to crowd source your searches (solicit input from others to enhance your web research). The 'social' element to Frompo requires us to use information in additional ways to provide the enhanced collaborative functionality. Below, we fully describe how we use

information provided to us so that you can make the decision of whether or not to use our website and its enhanced functionalities. 

Information Forwarded by Us to Improve Your Web Search Functionality: Frompo may share information regarding your website search, which is not personally identifiable to you, in order to enhance your search results. For example, we may forward your search queries to one of our vendors to check for misspellings (i.e., "Grand Canyo" may generate a did-you-mean reply of "Grand Canyon") or additional search terms that could provide more relevant search results. We also might forward your search query to one of our vendors to acquire supplemental results. 

Information Forwarded by Us to Provide Keyword Search Advertising: Frompo provides its search services and web-based tools on the web to you for free.We are able to sustain our free web-based content through advertising revenue. All of our advertising partners require that we send them your IP Address, user agent string as well as search keywords in order to deliver search keyword advertising to you. If you do not want us to forward your personal information for advertising purposes, you can opt-out of this sharing by selecting our "No Ads" preference, as described below. Further, Frompo will forward your DoNotTrack browser settings, if you are using a browser that has DoNotTrack header functionality.
