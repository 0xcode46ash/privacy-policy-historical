# Terms & Conditions

**ORDER ACCEPTANCE POLICY**

Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Froobi.com reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. Froobi.com reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. All orders placed over $500.00 ( USD ) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Froobi.com is a reseller to end user customers and does not accept orders from computer dealers, exporters, wholesalers, or other customers who intend to resell the products offered by Froobi.com.

**PROCESSING TIME**

If the item(s) on your order are in-stock, we will ship them as soon as possible from our warehouse or from one of our Distribution Warehouses located throughout the United States. If the item(s) on your order are out of stock, they will not be shipped until we have received and processed the backordered inventory in our warehouse.

**LISTINGS AND OFFERS**  
Listings on this website are not an offer to sell goods, rather, they are advertisements to receive offers. Any offer/order for more than 3 units per address, customer or company may be rejected, and all orders are subject to review and acceptance by Froobi.com. As all prices are subject to change, your order may not be accepted or we may have to communicate price changes or availability issues to you after you place your order.

**RETURN POLICY AND LIMITED GUARANTEE AGAINST DEFECTS**

Unless the item you ordered is considered Dead On Arrival (DOA), Froobi.com does not accept returns. This policy is due to the fact that our items are only available for one day and are already priced far below the retail value. Most of the products you buy from us are backed by the manufacturer's warranty that will cover issues of the item being broken or defective. If the item you received is DOA then it will be covered by our 14 day limited warranty.

Froobi.com's 14 day limited warranty is a defective exchange policy that provides for either repair or replacement (at our sole discretion) of merchandise that has been confirmed as DOA by either the manufacturer or Froobi.com. The 14 day limited warranty does not cover damages caused by shipping, normal wear and tear, faulty packaging, or cosmetic issues.

If the product you received qualifies for the Froobi.com 14 day limited warranty, please contact us at our [Customer Support Page](http://temp.froobi.com/contact/) or by email at support@froobi.com. We will send you an RMA form which you will need to include when you send us back the item. Products returned for exchange must be in new condition, original packaging and include all disks, registration cards, packing materials and other accessories, and be postmarked within 14 days of the invoice date. We will provide a replacement item or refund, not including shipping and handling. Customer is responsible for all freight charges.

After 14 days the product manufacturer warranty is the only warranty in effect. Terms and conditions may vary by product or manufacturer. Froobi.com will assist customers whenever possible in gaining satisfaction with product manufacturers.
