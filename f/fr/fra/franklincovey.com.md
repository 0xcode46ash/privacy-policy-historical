A Note to Parents on our Privacy Policy Regarding Children  
FranklinCovey is very sensitive to privacy issues and we are proud of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any communications with one of our most treasured customers - children and families. We collect only limited personal information from children 12 and under (like their email addresses) to respond to their online requests but we promptly delete the email address from our system. Solely FranklinCovey or other entities that provide technical use personal information collected from children on this site or fulfillment services to FranklinCovey for internal purposes like improving the site, or to fulfill requests; it is not sold or transferred to third parties. We do not associate cookie data with personal information about children. FranklinCovey will not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

In order to review any personal information we have about your child or to ask us to delete that information or to stop further use of the information, please submit this [Information Request Form](/about/privacy.pdf). We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities.
