# Privacy Policy

Franklin Covey may share your personal information when we: (1) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, and to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law; or (3) transfer information about you if Franklin Covey is acquired by or merged with another entity.

We may share your personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal functions on our behalf (for example, payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, hosting, and so forth). In such instances, the providers will be contractually required to protect personal information from additional use (including for marketing purposes) or transfer in accordance with this Privacy Policy and industry standards.

Occasionally, we make our customer list available to a few carefully screened firms offering products that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive such mailings or not to have your information shared in this manner, you may opt-out at any time. See the [choice/opt-out section](http://archive.franklincovey.com/tc/subscribe "unsubscribe") below.

We do not share personal information obtained for the purposes of preparing invoices or reports for clients, nor is such information used for promotional or marketing purposes. Â
