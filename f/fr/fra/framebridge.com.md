# Privacy Policy - Framebridge

Welcome to **www.framebridge.com** (the **“Site”** ), a website operated by Framebridge, LLCS ( **“Framebridge”, “we”, “us”,** or **“our”** ). If you’re reading this, you know that our Site provides users with an opportunity to learn more about and purchase custom frames and our other products (our **“Products”** ). We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site or whether you making a purchase.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase **“Personal Information”** in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase **“Anonymous Information”** in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual. References to our Site in this Privacy Policy also include our mobile application ( **“App”** ).

### Children

The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Site. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. When the Site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site. Additionally, if you are under 18, you may not purchase any Products.

### How We Collect Information

_Personal Information_  
In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to process your orders, to provide the Site and Products to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you register with us or order products. To create an “Account” with a user name, we require that you provide certain Personal Information, including your name and email address.

You are not required to have an Account to place an order. To place an order on the Site, we will require additional information from you, including your mailing address and phone number. All payments on the Site are processed by our service providers who collect your credit card information directly, and we will not have access to or see your credit card information as part of such transaction. We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily as you use the Site or if you contact us via e-mail regarding the Site or Products. 

Through our App, we may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with third party photo services such as Instagram (collectively, “Third Party Services”) through our App. We will work with the Third Party Services’ application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that Third Party Service on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the Third Party Service, but you will need to log-in to that Third Party Service directly through our App (e.g., when you click on “connect with us,” or a similar connection on the App). Once authorized by you, the **Third Party Service** will provide us a token that allows it to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. By proceeding, you are granting us and our App access to your information and you are agreeing to that Third Party Service’s terms of use in your use of their services. In some cases, we may receive information to make it easier for you to create an account with us and you may log in through the Third Party Service. Any information that we collect from a Third Party Service account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that provider, so please consult the Third Party Service’s privacy and data practices. You will be able to revoke our access to any Third Party Service at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable Third Party Service, though such revocation may limit the services we are able to provide you.

If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.

_Anonymous Information_

  * _Information Collected by Our Servers._ To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ( **“IP”** ) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
  * _Log Files._ As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ( **“ISP”** ), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Site to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.
  * Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. **“Cookies”** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. 
  * _Mobile Device._ If you use our App, we may collect information about the device you use to access our App, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, and mobile network information.
  * _Third Party Analytics._ We may use a third party tracking service such as Google Analytics to track and analyze Anonymous Information from users of our Site. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior. The use of these Cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these Cookies. For example, Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
