Users are not permitted to use the email contact forms and/or our lead submission forms for any use other than to gain further information from the franchisor and/or business opportunity. The email contact forms and/or lead submission forms on our website are only to be used to send inquiries about buying a particular business for sale, franchise, or other related business opportunity. By submitting your information you expressly confirm that you have a genuine interest in each of the concepts for which you have requested information; that you wish for a representative from each of the concepts to contact you; and that the information that you have submitted is true and correct. 

We are grateful that you have taken the time to come to our site and inquire about the exciting franchise and business opportunities we have listed. In order to provide the best service possible to both you and our clients we must insist that you respect and understand this Policy.
