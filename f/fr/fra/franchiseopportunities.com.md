# Privacy Policy, Disclaimer and Website Usage Policy

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us via our [Contact Us](http://www.franchiseopportunities.com/contact.asp) page.

**Contact Form Usage Policy**

Users are permitted to use the email contact forms and/or our lead submission forms only for the purpose to gain further information from the franchisor and/or business opportunity. The email contact forms and/or lead submission forms on our website are only to be used to send inquiries about buying a particular business for sale, franchise, or other related business opportunity. By submitting your information you expressly confirm that you have a genuine interest in each of the concepts for which you have requested information; that you wish for a representative from each of the concepts to contact you; and that the information that you have submitted is true and correct. Submitting contact forms for the expressed purpose of promoting a business or service is strictly prohibited.

We are grateful that you have taken the time to come to our site and inquire about the exciting franchise and business opportunities we have listed. In order to provide the best service possible to both you and our clients we must insist that you respect and understand this Policy. By submitting your information you expressly agree to receive a phone call or e-mail inquiry from the entity from whom you requested information. Submitting contact information that is either false or is done without interest to the particular business for which you have submitted your information is called "spamming". Spamming of any sort on our site is not permitted as it hurts the integrity, credibility, and value of our business. Moreover, it jeopardizes our ability to continue to provide our services to legitimate users. 

By using the website and submitting a contact form you agree with these conditions. 

**Advertising Service**

You may browse our website at any time without providing your contact and/or personal information. If, however, you are interested in an opportunity and/or any additional information from FO (and/or our advertisers) you may register with us and provide your name and contact information (i.e, address, telephone number and e-mail address etc). We share your information only with the franchises and business opportunities in which you have expressed interest. Franchise Opportunities.com ("FO") will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other third parties. If you no longer want to receive information from a franchise or business opportunity, please contact that franchise or business opportunity directly. 

FO also periodically sends newsletters, franchise and business opportunity updates and new advertiser information via e-mail to users who have subscribed and given their permission. If you wish to unsubscribe to our e-mails please follow the simple instructions to do so which are located at the bottom of each mailing. If for some reason the **unsubscribe** function does not work please contact us via our [Contact Us](http://www.franchiseopportunities.com/contact.asp) page. We only add you to our mailing list if so authorized. Moreover, we do not share your e-mail address or other personal information with other companies unless authorized by you. 

FO is a lead generation and advertising service. Business brokers, agents, business buyers, independent business sellers, franchise companies, attorneys, and any and all other listings found on the FO website are simply advertising purchasers, listing service purchasers, or other advertising clients and are not employed by or otherwise affiliated in any way with FO.
