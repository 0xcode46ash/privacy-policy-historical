#### Our Web site

All users can view content on our Web site without submitting any personal information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.) to us. However, in order to provide you with a better user experience, we may collect non-personal information from your computer using cookies. More information on this process is below.

#### Our information request form

When you request information from one or more of our Sponsors by submitting your contact information (name, address, phone number, e-mail, etc.) on our registration form, we pass your information only to the businesses that you specify. No other business receives your contact information. Your information, however, is often stored in the receiving company's database, as well as ours. Collected data may be stored in a database outside your home country.

#### Our newsletter program

We offer opportunities to register to receive our e-mail newsletter, both in various locations on our Web site and on our Information Request Form. We only add you to our mailing list if you authorize us to. Moreover, we do not share your e-mail address or other personal information with other companies unless authorized by you.

#### Our use of tracking technologies

In many cases, we collect non-personal information from your computer using cookies, which are standard Internet technologies used to measure user traffic. For example, cookie data is useful in measuring user visits, browsing patterns, or e-mail message views. This information helps us to provide you with a better user experience by enabling us to compile statistics and measures of user satisfaction, and thereby to continually improve our Web site. Some of this information is collected and compiled by third-party service providers. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

We employ, as do some of our third party advertising partners, a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information in some instances.

A cookie is a small amount of data that a Web sites server sends to your browser, which is stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be removed from your hard drive. Also, depending on the type and version of web browser you are using, you may be able to change how your computer treats cookies so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.

#### Special cases

In a limited number of cases, we may choose to share either personal or non-personal information with third-parties. Such examples are subpoenas, court orders or other requests to cooperate with other types of legal enforcement.

#### Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that we are acquired or assigned, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

#### Links to third parties

Although Franchise Gator provides links to other sites that may provide valuable information, we cannot control how they collect or manage personal information from their Web sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and data collection procedures.

#### Security measures

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. While no data transfer can be completely secure, we will make reasonable efforts to secure your data while being transferred, stored or processed.

#### Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Please contact us if you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Social Media Features and Widgets

Our Web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the ShareThis button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

#### Children's privacy

Franchise Gator is intended to be used by individuals over the age of 18. We do not seek or willingly collect information on children under the age of 18. If we discover that we have collected information on a child under the age of 13, then we will delete that information from our system.

#### Updates and Effective Date

We reserve the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy from time to time for any reason. Any modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon posting, unless otherwise indicated. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this Web site prior to the change becoming effective, typically 30 days in advance. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it and to whom we consent to disclose it.

#### Additional information

We need your assistance in keeping your information up to date. If you would like to review, correct or change your personal information or need assistance unsubscribing, please email us at [privacyinfo@franchisegator.com](mailto:privacyinfo@franchisegator.com) or write to us at the address below.
