Franchise and Business Opportunities for Entrepreneurs

**Last updated: June 2008**

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=web.archive.org&sealid=102 "Truste Certified")

Franchise Gator, a Microsoft Corporation Subsidiary, is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Franchise Gator through [www.franchisegator.com](http://www.franchisegator.com/), [www.franchisegator.co.uk](http://www.franchisegator.co.uk/), and the other co-branded Franchise Gator Web sites that link to this statement (the "Sites"); it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline sites, products or services. 

### Collection of Your Personal Information

We may collect information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you on our Sites. The personal information we collect may include name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Sites. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every Web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. 

To register for a newsletter, you will be asked to enter an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Windows Liveâ„¢ ID or your Microsoft Passport Network credentials. After you create your Windows Live ID, you can use the same credentials to sign into many different Microsoft sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners, that display the Windows Live ID or Microsoft Passport Network logos. By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed in when you visit other Microsoft sites and services. To learn more about how your credential information is used when you sign into participating sites or our newsletter system, please read the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement at <http://privacy.microsoft.com/>. 

### Use of Your Personal Information

The personal information collected on the Sites will be used to operate the Sites and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. 

In support of these uses, Franchise Gator may use personal information to respond to an inquiry, to improve the Sites, and to make the Sites easier to use by customizing the Sites to your particular preference or interests. 

In addition, we may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Franchise Gator products and services. 

Franchise Gator occasionally hires third parties to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Some of our Sites may have sections with articles. The "share this" function in the articles section of the Sites allows you to bookmark a posting or to e-mail it to yourself or a friend. When you use the "share this" feature to send a posting to a friend, we use your personal information and your friend's e-mail address only to deliver the posting to your friend. The "share this" feature is hosted on our Web site, and both your personal information and your friend's e-mail address are not shared with any other company, nor do we use this information for any other purpose. 

Some Franchise Gator services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Franchise Gator and the other company may share information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services. Franchise Gator may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Franchise Gator or the Sites; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Franchise Gator and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Franchise Gator products or members of the public. 

Personal information collected on the Sites may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Franchise Gator, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities or do business, and by using the Sites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Franchise Gator abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

### Control of Your Personal Information

Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Sites will not be shared outside of Franchise Gator and Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. 

You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Franchise Gator, by following the specific instructions to unsubscribe within the e-mail you receive. You may also [click here](http://franchisegator.frngat.com/unsub/unsub.form?id=b14cb43489d8ddb8690efe5eb422af66) to unsubscribe from future promotional e-mail from Franchise Gator. 

If you wish to unsubscribe from a newsletter, you may opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any of the e-mail newsletters you receive. 

Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Sites will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Franchise Gator in the context of other, separately operated, Franchise Gator products or services. Although Franchise Gator provides links to other sites and access to third parties that may provide valuable information, we cannot control how they manage the personal information they receive from us. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and data collection procedures on their Web sites. 

### Access to Your Personal Information

You can review and edit the personal information you provided at the Sites by contacting us through our [Web form](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=8559384) and we will contact you within 30 days regarding your request. 

### Security of Your Personal Information

Franchise Gator is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

### Use of Cookies

We use cookies on the Sites to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Sites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

Cookies may also be used to measure user traffic such as browsing patterns and user visits. This information helps us to provide a better user experience through the use of statistics and measurements of user satisfaction. Some of this information may be collected and compiled by third-party service providers who place cookies on our Web sites to provide us with Web analytics. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually [modify your browser setting](http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm) to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other Web sites that depend on cookies. 

### Use of Web Beacons

Franchise Gator Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our Sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. 

Franchise Gator may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We prohibit Web beacons on our Sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. 

### Complaints and Outside Resources

Franchise Gator is a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact us by using our [Web form](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=8559384). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Franchise Gator to resolve your concerns. 

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our Web sites or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
