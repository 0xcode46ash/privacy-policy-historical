FranchiseHelp.com Privacy Statement  
**  
FranchiseHelp gathers information from site visitors from time to time to enhance existing services or provide additional services. The company gathers only the information essential for understanding visitors in such a way as to provide better service. This may include contact information such as name, email address, telephone number, and company name, and perhaps other data. The information is used exclusively by FranchiseHelp unless otherwise noted on the site. FranchiseHelp does not make this information available to third parties who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes.

**Uses of the information**

FranchiseHelp uses the information it collects for internal purposes to develop products and services better suited to the needs of its users. Occasionally FranchiseHelp provides users’ information to its partners, with those users’ permission. In such instances, FranchiseHelp alerts users that it will share such information, and users may choose whether to provide the information. 

FranchiseHelp.com contains links to other sites. In the main, these links will access advertiser websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these client companies or the content of such Web sites.
