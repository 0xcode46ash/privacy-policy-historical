# Franchise Direct - The Franchising Opportunities Listing

_Franchise Direct_ is designed as a tool to assist you in your franchising research and as a means of communication between franchisors and potential franchisees. This site contains a number of forms, tools and services to allow you to gather further information on available franchise opportunities.

In order to better provide our matchmaking services most of the forms on _Franchise Direct_ request a degree of personal and financial information. This information will be used solely for the purposes of communicating with the franchises on our site. Your information will be used only to request information, for you, from relevant franchises.

_Franchise Direct_ does not sell your name, address or any other personal information that you provide to any other third party. _Franchise Direct_ will neither share nor distribute your information for any purposes other than those outlined above.
