#### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Frame Publishers is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

#### Public discussions

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to articles, that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

#### Correcting, Updating or Removing Information

User profile information may be displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the frameweb.com community. Frameweb.com users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such as edit profile and account info.

#### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to our [webmaster](mailto:site@frameweb.com).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

#### Security / Enforcement

Frame Publishers will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all personal information provided to the Frame Publishers website. However, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, Frame Publishers cannot guarantee that this information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you are requested to send us any sensitive personal information, such as your credit card number or password, in an e-mail or into a website or otherwise, and you are uncertain whether such request is authorized by us, please do not hesitate to ask us by sending an e-mail to our privacy officer at [webmaster](mailto:site@frameweb.com).

#### Business Transfer

In the event that Frame Publishers or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer personaliInformation may be one of the transferred assets.

#### Change of policy

This privacy policy may be changed by Frame Publishers at any time. The revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Frame Publishers will ensure that your personal information is treated with the utmost respect and in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
