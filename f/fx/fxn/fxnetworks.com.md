**Privacy Policy**

We at FX Networks, LLC and fXM Networks, Inc. (collectively "FX") understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach you, the public, in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun sweepstakes and contests, and other forms of interaction. Visitors to our web sites can be confident that we are very respectful of their privacy concerns. Specifically, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our visitors. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as name, address or e-mail address, is automatically collected from visitors to our site.

**IP ADDRESSES**

We may collect and disclose certain non-personal information from your IP address. This information is used only to provide an enhanced on-line experience for our visitors by optimizing our web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may also use this non-personal information to determine the total number of visitors to our web sites.

**USE OF COOKIES**

When you view our web site, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a 'Cookie' or similar file and will help us in many ways.

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**

Personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by those visitors. FX uses such information only for the purpose for which it was is submitted, unless we disclose other uses at the time of collection. FX does not sell or transfer personal information to third parties. FX may share personally identifiable information with other parts of our company. FX maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of personally identifiable information in its possession. FX may use such personally identifiable information in the aggregate (non-identifiable) form to make our web site better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable information may also be used by or provided to others for marketing, advertising, or research purposes.

**SWEEPSTAKES AND/OR CONTESTS**

Sweepstakes, contests, games and other promotions run on FX's web sites may require the visitor to provide some personally identifiable information such as full name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, in order to participate. FX may use a reputable third party to manage and administer some of its sweepstakes and/or contests. This third party may have access to some of the personally identifiable information that is provided by the visitor in order to participate in the sweepstakes and/or contest. In those instances, the third party will be instructed by FX to use the personally identifiable information only for the specific sweepstakes and/or contest related purpose for which it was requested. Most often this information is used only to select and contact winners of the sweepstakes and/or contests. Any other use of the personally identifiable information by the third party is strictly prohibited. Our sweepstakes and/or contests are targeted to individuals 18 years of age and older, individuals under 18 years of age are not eligible to participate. FX requires proof of age in order to collect any prizes awarded.

However, FX is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our web sites. These links are meant for the visitor's convenience only. Links to third party web sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by FX of content, policies or practices of such sites. Once you have left a FX web site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. FX's web site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with FX. Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy policies and practices.
