# FX Networks Privacy Policy

Effective as of April 15, 2009.

FX Networks, LLC ("FX," "we," "us") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles ([the "Principles"](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html)) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. FX has implemented those Principles in this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"), which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain online and offline from and about individuals located in the U.S.

FX's [web site](http://www.fxnetworks.com/) and all other related web sites owned or controlled by us (collectively or individually the "Site") are general audience web sites, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

Our Privacy Policy applies to "Visitors," which means that you simply browse the Site, "Subscribers," which means that you have subscribed to receive: (i) one or more FX newsletter or partner emails; and/or (ii) FX Mobile Alerts from FX or its mobile partners and "Members," which means that you have registered with FX. The term "User" refers to a Visitor, Subscriber or a Member. By using our Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site.

From time to time FX may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, FX will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after FX posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If FX materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. In the event the last e-mail address you provided to us is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, FX's dispatch of an e-mail containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice.

_**A. COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY FX**_

1\. _General_.�When FX collects PII, such as your full name, email address, physical address and mobile phone number, from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register as a Member or a Subscriber, or to participate in activities like creating a personal profile ("Your Profile"), sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

You may also choose to voluntarily provide or store non-PII information in Your Profile (as described in Section A.1(a) below) or provide or store non-PII information on other public forums provided on our Site, including but not limited to, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, private messages, chats or any other materials (collectively "Content") that you choose to post to the Site (Content posted by any User is "User Content"). If you choose to make Your Profile or any information from Your Profile public or provide any User Content on other public forums provided on our Site, you do so at your sole discretion and risk.

Members can change their Registration Data (as defined below in Section A(1)(a) and Your Profile information at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members and FX communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the "Edit Profile" portion of Your Profile.

FX collects information from you at several different points on the Site in the manner set forth below:

(a). _Member Registration and Profile_ : In order to access certain information and services on the Site, you must first become a Member by completing our member registration form. During the registration process you will be required to provide registration data, which may include PII such as your name and e-mail address (such information is the "Registration Data"). The Registration Data will automatically become incorporated into Your Profile; however, in the Your Profile section of the Site, you have the option to make such Registration Data (including, but not limited to, your PII) public or private. You also have the option of adding certain User Content to Your Profile.

**Important Information about Changing and Updating Your Profile** : If Your Profile information changes, you may correct, update, edit, or remove it. You can edit Your Profile information by going to the Your Profile page and clicking on the "Edit Your Profile" button.

(b). _Newsletters and Mobile Alerts_ : During the subscription process you will be required to provide subscriber data, which may include your e-mail address, zip code and mobile phone number (such information is the "Subscriber Data"). If you would like to subscribe or unsubscribe from any FX newsletter or FX Mobile Alerts please refer to our [Terms of Use](http://www.fxnetworks.com/html/terms.php) for more information.

(c). _Surveys, Contests and Quizzes_ : You may have the opportunity to participate in surveys and quizzes on our Site. We will use survey responses to guide us as we make improvements and enhancements to our Site. We encourage you to complete surveys and quizzes so that we can provide you with a more personalized experience on our Site, such as featuring content and advertising that we believe are consistent with your interests. We will not use your responses for any other purpose without your prior consent.

On our Site you may also have the opportunity to participate in contests and other promotions that may require you to provide information about yourself. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy (See Section D (Use) below) we will not share your contest information with any third party, except in aggregate form, without your prior consent. In addition, if and when we sponsor contests or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes, contest or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes, contest or promotion�please remember to read it carefully.

(e). _Message Board, Discussion Rooms and Social Networking_ : FX provides message boards, discussion rooms and other public forums on the Site for exchanging information related to FX programming and social networking. Please note that information, User Content or any other materials that you post on our Site, including any information from Your Profile that you choose to make public, will be available for any User of that service to read, and is therefore no longer private and may be disclosed without limitations as to its use by a third party. If you post information, materials or User Content on our Site or other public forum you provide information that can be collected and used by others that you do not know for their own purposes, including the distribution of unsolicited communications. FX reserves the right to reproduce or publish any materials posted on our Site in any other formats.

2\. _Cookies_. Cookies are small bits of information that the Site place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our Site and enable FX to make your visits to our Site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a Site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page. Information about your activities on our Site and other non-PII about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on our Site may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. FX does not control these cookies and visitors to our Site should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See Section B ( _Notice_ ) below for more information on third party advertisements).

FX may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Site to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our Site may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if FX wishes to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being set or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on our Site, or contests.

A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types of views for that page. FX may allow third party pixel tags to be present on the Site for purposes of advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection. We also may use pixel tags in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we may include pixel tags and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened. 

_**B. NOTICE: FX WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES**_

When you voluntarily provide PII to FX, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FX will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, FX will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See Section C (Choice) below). This Privacy Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your PII, provided you have given FX permission to do so (See Section D (Use: FX's _Use of PII_ ) below).

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in an off-line or manual format, such as a post card or by mobile phone. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us.

The Site may be linked to Internet web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party web sites may be co-branded with a FX logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by FX (for example, the co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). The Site also carries advertisements from other companies. FX is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you leave a FX Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, FX's Privacy Policy no longer applies and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser web site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

The Site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with FX (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's Privacy Principles (<http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>), visitors to those affiliated web sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on the Site are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our Site, including information about the banner ads they display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

<http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>

<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

_**C. CHOICE: FX WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII**_

FX will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or, except as provided in this Privacy Policy (See Section D ( _Use_ ) below), share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with FX (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.

_**D. USE: FX'S USE OF PII**_

FX will use your PII provided under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If FX obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

Unless a User has opted out of receiving such e-mails during the registration process, FX may occasionally send Users who provide us with their e-mail addresses information about special offers, Site updates, contests and other offerings via e-mail. We may also send information about products and offerings of our partners that we think may be of interest to our Members and Subscribers. To opt out of receiving these partner e-mails from us please visit <http://fxnetworks.com/registration/>.

FX may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, FX may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with FX, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, FX may share your PII with the companies who supply prizes for FX's contests and may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to FX users. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected. 

FX employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. FX may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities but they may only use your PII to provide FX with a specific service and not for any other purpose. For example, if you subscribe to FX Mobile Alerts, your mobile number will be shared with our mobile alerts service provider and your mobile carrier; and if you enter a sweepstakes on the Site your PII may be shared with our sweepstakes administrators. 

FX may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows FX to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our Site may be shared with these companies so this customization may be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with FX's advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when FX may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of FX, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if FX sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FX may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

_**E. SECURITY: FX PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII**_

FX uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, FX uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. However, no security system is impenetrable. FX cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to FX over the Internet.

_**F. ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII**_

Whenever possible, Members and Subscribers may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member or Subscriber informs us of in writing is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view, change and remove your PII, Member preferences and Your Profile information by logging into your account and accessing "Edit Profile." Section A(1)(b) above describes how to change your subscriptions preferences.

If for any reason you want FX to stop using your PII, FX will honor that request; however, FX will retain any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Keep in mind, moreover, that there will be residual information that will remain within FX's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such PII. Even after removal of PII and User Content by you or FX, PII and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.

If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or FX's collection or use of your PII, or request FX delete your PII, please contact FX at:
