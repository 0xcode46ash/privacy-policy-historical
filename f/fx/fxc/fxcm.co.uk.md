### Security Technology

FXCM uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than FXCM while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our websites are secure and that they meet industry standards.
