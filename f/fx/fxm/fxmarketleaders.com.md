Privacy Policy**

  
Your privacy is important; therefore we have created this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand your rights.  We may intermittently make changes to the policy and they shall be included on this page.  It is up to you to review this Privacy Policy regularly and stay informed about any changes made to it, hence we encourage you to visit this page often. **   **By using the Site you agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version.

**Collection of Your Email Address**  
Signing up to the Site requires you to supply an email address or other information needed to contact you online. Any email address supplied may later be accessed, updated, modified and deleted. Please note, we normally keep a copy of any previous email addresses for our records.

This information is used to aid and improve your use of the Site, for communication purposes, and to comply with any requirements of law. We shall also use this information in order to respond to any questions you might have.  Without your permission, your email address will not be sold or revealed to third parties other than as specified in this Privacy Policy unless we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if requested to do so by Court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or any other crime). 

Your information may be disclosed to our staff or third parties involved in the analysis and support of your use of the Site.  If necessary we may disclose your information to protect our legal rights, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful actions, or we have good reason to believe that disclosing information is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of the law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on us; or to protect and defend our property or other rights, the users of the Site or the public.  This includes the exchange of information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk protection.  If the Site ever files for bankruptcy, is part of a reorganisation, sells its assets or merges with a separate company, we may sell information provided to us through the Site to a third party or share your information with the third party or company we merge with.

Links to third party websites may be present on this Site. Even if these websites are accessed via links from our Site, we are not responsible for their privacy practices or the content.  You use these third party websites entirely at your own risk and it is recommended that you check the privacy and security policies of every site you visit.  Clicking on a third party link essentially takes you to a third party’s website.  We make no representation or warranty as to the effectiveness, quality, legitimacy or data protections of any third party website.
