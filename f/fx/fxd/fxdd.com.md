# FXDIRECTDEALER PRIVACY STATEMENT

FXDIRECTDEALER PRIVACY STATEMENT
FXDIRECTDEALER (the "Company") respects the privacy interests of visitors to
this web site. The Company is committed to providing you with a secure web site
environment. This Privacy Statement describes the nature of that respect and
commitment by detailing the types of the personal information that we collect, the
uses we make of that information, and related information regarding your ability
to access, correct, and request deletion of any personal identifying information
you choose to give us.
I. INFORMATION COLLECTED:
When submitting feedback, your curriculum vitae or other information to the
Company via this site, you are asked to provide specific identifying information,
including without limitation a valid e-mail address.
II. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION:
Identifying information may be used for general statistical analyses of the use of
our site, to improve the content of our site and offerings, and to customize our
site to better meet your needs. We may use and disclose your personal
identifying information in a number of ways related to your use of this web site.
The Company and its affiliates may, from time to time, use your personal
identifying information in connection with sending you specific, targeted
information in which you have expressed interest or which the Company believes
would be of interest to you. We also may use aggregated information, which
does not identify you personally, for marketing, promotional and other business
purposes. You may opt out of receiving special offers, promotions or mailings at
any time. The Company will not sell our contact list or provide your personal
identifying information to any non-affiliated person or entity in the ordinary course
of our business, although the Company expressly reserves the right to transfer
such information in connection with a change in ownership of the Company or its
assets. The Company may employ third parties who perform various services
with respect to this web site. Your personally identifying information is made
available to these third party service suppliers strictly for use in connection with
the services being performed on behalf of this web site. The Company may also
disclose information as described below under the heading "Security".
III. ACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION:
If you want to see the personal information we have collected about you from this
web site or if you believe any information we have is incorrect and you wish to
correct it, please write to the Company at the address given at the end of this
Privacy Statement. If the Company changes or deletes information in response to
your request, we will not then continue to use it; however, some residual
information may remain in backup records or records of deletions.
IV. SECURITY:
The Company uses efforts consistent with sound industry practice, such as


firewalls and encryption, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal
identifying information. Given the nature of the Internet, however, the Company
cannot and does not ensure complete security. The Company shall not be
responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any other person or
entity. Hackers pose a threat to any Internet user, and the legal and regulatory
status of matters on the Internet is uncertain both in the United States and
abroad. For these reasons, the Company cannot and does not guarantee that all
of your personal identifying information will never be disclosed in ways you do
not expect or which are not described in this Privacy Statement. We will make
commercially reasonable efforts to see that your information is treated in
compliance with this Privacy Statement. The Company cooperates with law
enforcement inquiries, we obey court orders, and we honor subpoenas and other
legal process. Your personal identifying information may be disclosed if we are
compelled by law or legal process to disclose it. We may also disclose such
information if we determine, in our sole discretion, that disclosure would be useful
in connection with investigating possible non-compliance either with the law or
with any FXDIRECTDEALER policy, including our Terms of Service or this
Privacy Statement.
V. CHILDREN:
Children under 18 should not send any information about themselves to us,
including information like your name, address or e-mail address. The Company
does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under
the age of 18. In the event that we learn that we have collected such information
from a child under 18, the information will be deleted from our database as soon
as reasonably possible.
VI. CHANGES IN PRIVACY STATEMENT AND WEBSITE MAINTENANCE:
As our business grows and changes, and as technology and Internet use and
practices change, the Company may, from time to time, determine that changes
in its policies, including this Privacy Statement, are prudent. If any such changes
are made, they will be posted on this web site. Therefore you should review this
Privacy Policy and other policies posted on this web site for potential changes
when you return to the site for future visits. This Site is owned and maintained by
FXDIRECTDEALER 75 Park Place, 4th Floor New York, NY 10007. Please send
your questions or comments to us at this address, Attention: Webmaster or via e-
mail: support@fxdd.com.
