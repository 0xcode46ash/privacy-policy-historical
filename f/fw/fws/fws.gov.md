**PRIVACY STATEMENT**

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to maintaining a web site that protects the individual’s right to privacy. We do **not** require personal information from our visitors, nor do we collect any personally identifying information (name, email address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) unless you knowingly provide it. Likewise, we do **not** give, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party except as might be required by law .

**Data Collection for Statistics**  
To aid in web site management, certain information is collected for statistical purposes. The Service uses specialized software to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest to our customers, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

We collect only the following information about your visit:

  * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, "princeton.edu" if you are connecting from Princeton University’s domain, or "aol.com" if you are connecting from an America Online account);
  * The web site from which you linked directly to our web site, if you have used another web site to reach our site;
  * The operating system and web browser you use to view pages;
  * The date and time you access our web site.



We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our web site, allowing us to make our web site more useful and accessible to visitors. We do not store any personal identifiers. 

**Information Collected from E-mails and Forms**  
You may decide to send us personally identifying information through e-mail messages or through on-line forms. Electronic communication allows us to collect information that will improve our web site for you, and we encourage it. We use personally-identifying information from consumers in various ways to further our customer's protection and to provide better service. This may be to correct broken links that you have identified or provide additional information that you have requested. 

Visit the Department's [**Talk to Us**](http://www.doi.gov/footer/question.htm) page to learn what can happen to the information you provide us when you send us e-mail or fill out a questionnaire or guestbook. Any information that we collect via a questionnaire or a guestbook may be subject to disclosure, but will be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act to ensure the greatest protection of personal privacy in the face of any required disclosure.
