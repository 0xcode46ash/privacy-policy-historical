**FAA Privacy and Web Site Policy **

The Federal Aviation Administration is committed to respecting your right to privacy and will protect it when you visit our web site. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. This policy explains how we handle information about your visit to our website. 

**Internet Security**

We monitor and audit visit to our web site to identify and deter any attempt to tamper with it. We use technologies which allow us to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage, to ensure the web site is available to all users. We may be required to identify you personally when legally required by law enforcement or counterintelligence organizations. Any information we collect for those investigations is protected and destroyed according to federal guidelines. 

You may not try to upload information to or change information on this website, defeat or circumvent security features, or use this system for other than its intended purposes without permission from FAA. If you do, you may be punished under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act and Title 5 of the USC. 

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

When you visit our web site we collect certain information about your visit that does not identify you personally. We can tell the type of computer, browser, and web service you are using. We also know the date and time you visit and the pages you visit. Collecting this information helps us design the site according to your needs. 

Sometimes we use "cookies," which are small amounts of text stored on your computer. We use only "session cookies" in some places where people can transact business. That means we store the cookie on your computer only during your visit; and weâ€™ll notify you in advance. So, if you are entering information for a business transaction, you won't lose the information if you go to another site and come back during the visit. After you turn off your computer or stop using the Internet, the cookie is erased. 

**E-mail and web forms**

When you send us e-mail we won't keep or share your e-mail address with anyone outside of DOT staff and its contractors. We'll use your e-mail address only to respond to your requests for information. 

If you sign up for one of our electronic mailing lists, we'll send you only the kinds of information you've requested. We won't keep your name on the list or share your e-mail address with anyone outside of DOT. 

**Accessibility**

Our policy is to provide access to all our programs, services and information to people with disabilities that is comparable to the level of access provided to others, as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. This includes making sure that our websites are accessible to people with disabilities.
