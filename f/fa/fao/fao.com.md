# FAO SCHWARZ ONLINE PRIVACY PRACTICES

******FAO SCHWARZ® ONLINE PRIVACY PRACTICES**

At FAO Schwarz, your right to privacy is our number one concern. That is why, when you visit fao.com, we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site [www.fao.com](http://www.fao.com/). 

The online store at [www.fao.com](http://www.fao.com/) is designed to give you control over the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but would rather give your credit card information to a representative over the telephone, you may do so by calling 1-800-426-TOYS.

When you provide your personal information such as name, street address, email address and phone number, FAO Schwarz will not give or sell this information to any outside company for any use. Moreover, it has always been an FAO Schwarz policy to contact customers in the event of a potential problem with your purchase or any normal business communication regarding your purchase.

When you place an order for merchandise on the FAO site, you will be asked for certain personal information and your credit card information required to process the order. The secure processing of credit card transactions is done by Yahoo! Inc., which hosts the FAO site. The credit card information collected by Yahoo! Inc. is sent to FAO Schwarz to complete the processing of your order. Operation of the FAO site, however, is solely within the control of FAO Schwarz.

If you indicate that you are interested in receiving offers or information from FAO Schwarz, we may occasionally e-mail about products and services that we feel may be on interest to you. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply reply “Remove” and we will act accordingly.

New technologies are emerging on the Internet that help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At FAO Schwarz, we primarily use “cookies” to maintain your shopping experience in our online store. A cookie is a small amount of data that is automatically sent to your web browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. They help you navigate our site easier. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using or your Internet service protocol (ISP) address, but beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience with using [www.fao.com.](http://www.fao.com/)and to help us offer better products and services to meet the needs of our valued customers. 

FAO Schwarz has no desire or intent to invade your privacy while using the fao.com site and we will never provide your personal information to anyone else.

Children should obtain permission from a parent before contacting FAO Schwarz in any regard, especially before entering any personal information or requesting information. FAO Schwarz does not permit children under the age of 13 to place any orders or communicate with us using this site without the express permission of their parents or legal guardian. If FAO detects that you are under the age of 13, you will be asked to have your parents or guardian send an email or fax to FAO to confirm authorization.

Naturally, the safety of children is very important to FAO Schwarz. FAO shares CARU’s (The Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau) concerns for child safety on the Internet. FAO Schwarz does not solicit personally identifiable information from children. We are also in the process of developing new practices and effective parental-guardianship authorization procedures for children under the age of 13, pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a new law passed by Congress last year that becomes effective later this year. The law requires sites that target children or know that a visitor to their site is a child under the age of 13 to follow certain new Federal Trade Commission rules that go into effect in April 2000. One of the rules is that a site must get parental or guardian consent in order to collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13. We will shortly institute features that will enable a parent or legal guardian to create an account for a child and let FAO know that the child has permission from a parent or guardian before he or she is given an account. Once we enable these new procedures, FAO Schwarz will impose the following children’s requirements when a visitor is under 13 years old:

1\. Personal online contact information will not be collected without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and the child’s participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request for information and will not be used for other purposes.

2\. Personally identifiable offline contact information will not be collected without prior parental consent.

3\. In no case will any personally identifiable information be distributed to third parties or otherwise posted, consistent with FAO’s current policy regarding all users.

4\. FAO will not entice any child under the age of 13 to divulge more personal information than is needed to use the site or participate in any online activity by offering any special game, prize, incentive or other similar activity.

FAO.com uses the Yahoo! Store shopping basket. Under this partnership, Yahoo! maintains information about FAO Schwarz and FAO.com on Yahoo! servers, including but not limited to account registration information, customer order information, sales information, and clickstream data ("Merchant Information"). Yahoo! is permitted to use Merchant Information in aggregate form (i.e., statistical data) only for marketing or other promotional purposes.

Yahoo! may disclose Merchant Information in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce the Yahoo! Merchant Store Agreement; (d) to respond to claims that FAO Schwarz is engaged in activities that violate the rights of third parties; or (e) to protect the rights or interests of Yahoo!, Yahoo! Store or others; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall impose a duty on Yahoo! to make any such disclosures. More information on Yahoo!’s merchant policy can be found at: [http://store.yahoo.com/disclaimer.html](http://store.yahoo.com/vm/disclaimer.html) Similarly, FAO Schwarz may disclose personal information of a user only if required to (a) comply with the law, (b) comply with legal process or (c) defend claims that FAO or Yahoo! is engaged in activities that violate the rights of third parties.

This site contains links to other sites as a convenience and for informational purposes only. FAO Schwarz is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
