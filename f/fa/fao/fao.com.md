# Guest Assistance - Privacy Policy at FAO Schwarz速

**1\. What does the FAO Schwarz速 Privacy Policy cover?**

FAO Schwarz速 and FAO.com are brands of Toys "R" Us-Delaware, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us").

This privacy policy outlines FAO Schwarz速 and FAO.com practices regarding information collected (a) online at FAO.com and any other websites operated by the Company (the "Sites"); and (b) at the Company's retail stores in the United States (the "Retail Stores").

We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This policy was last revised on October 26, 2009. By visiting the Sites or otherwise interacting with the Company, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**2\. What information do we collect?**

Each time you visit a Site, the web server automatically collects your internet service provider's address, the web page from which you came, web browser software, and a record of your activity while visiting the site.

We collect personally identifiable information (such as first and last name, credit card number, home address, e-mail address and telephone number) that you provide when you make a purchase; visit the Retail Stores or the Sites; create or edit your registries and wish lists; participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion; fill out a survey or questionnaire; sign up for a program or club; contact the Company (by e-mail or otherwise); contact the Company's customer service representative; or otherwise interact with the Company. Information that you provide at the Retail Stores may be combined with information that you provide online at the Sites, as well as with information about your product interests and purchases. The information you provide to We may also be combined with demographic and other information that is available in order to allow us to better communicate with you and enhance your shopping experience.

For purposes of this policy, information regarding your children that you (the parent) provide to the Company is treated in the same manner as information collected about you.

**3\. How do we use and share personal information?**

Your personal information is used by the Company to enhance your guest relationship with us, respond to your requests, tailor offerings to you, communicate with you about products, services, special offerings and events or programs offered by the Company or their marketing partners that may be of interest to you. The Company may also use this information to analyze and manage its businesses. Aggregate data (which does not allow an individual to be identified, contacted or located) is collected from online and offline facilities and may be used to enhance the ability of the Company to communicate with you, and for internal analysis and management purposes.

_Sharing Your Personal Information_  
We will not license, sell or provide your personal information to any unaffiliated third party except as permitted by this policy or with your consent. We share your personal information as set forth below:

These service providers are granted access to some or all of your personal information as necessary and may use cookies (as defined below) on our behalf, but are contractually restricted from using your personal information in any manner other than as may be necessary to perform their services. We may also utilize service providers to assist us in aggregating customer information. We may then share such aggregated information with prospective marketing partners and advertisers.

We use industry standard security techniques on the Sites to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information collected from you at the Sites. When you access your account information or transmit personally identifiable data to the Sites, that information is stored on servers that the Sites have attempted to secure from unauthorized access or intrusion. "Secure Socket Layer" software encrypts all personal information you transmit to the Sites. We cannot be and are not responsible for unauthorized access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures.

We do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. If you reject cookies, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or receive a presentation tailored to you.
