PRIVACY  


Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to FatTail, our advertisers and our e-mail newsletter publishers. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. See below for more information regarding FatTail's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet. 

Collected Information

In the course of advertisement delivery, FatTail does not collect any personally-identifiable information such as name, address, phone number or email address. FatTail does, however, collect non-personally identifiable information about users and whether a user responded to the ad delivered. 

The non-personally identifiable information collected by FatTail is used for the purpose of measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of FatTail's advertisers and e-mail newsletter publishers who specifically request it.

Opt-in E-mail

E-mail is sent only to people who have consented to receive a particular email publication or mailing from a company. If at any time a user would like to end a subscription to an email publication or mailing, he/she can follow either the directions posted at the end of the email publication or mailing, or the directions at the email newsletter company’s Web site. 

E-mail addresses may be joined with the information provided at our client’s website and may be augmented with other data sources. However, FatTail does not link e-mail addresses to any other Web browsing activities or clickstream data.
