### How we will use your details

Our offers: Once you have purchased with us, we would like to send you our latest catalogue and information on our kit and special offers.

When you register we will ask you if you wish to receive such information - if you do, simply tick the appropriate box. Alternatively you can always e-mail us with your details and mailing preferences.

We may also use your information to manage your purchases such as sending a confirmatory email, and your card payments for goods you buy from us and also to deliver the goods to you, or we might give your details to our carrier if they deliver on our behalf.
