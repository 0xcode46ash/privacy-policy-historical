  1. **PRIVACY STATEMENT**
    1. **Commitment.** The FastDomain commitment to our Subscribers' privacy is set forth in this section. Except as required by law or as otherwise provided herein, FastDomain will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure your right to privacy. FastDomain is committed to developing long lasting relationships that are built on trust and will never intentionally violate that trust.

    2. **Encryption.** When Subscriber orders from FastDomain, Personal Data Transmissions are encrypted. When Subscriber orders from FastDomain, all of Subscriber's personal information is protected. FastDomain uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard, for encrypting all personal information, including name, address and credit card numbers.

    3. **Confidentiality.** With the exception of trusted business affiliates and/or associates who work on behalf of or in connection with FastDomain, subject to specific confidentiality agreements, FastDomain will not provide or sell to any third party your personal information and will keep all Subscriber information confidential, subject to the following:

      1. Upon registration, certain Subscriber information is transferred to WHOIS (domain registration information), to our affiliated third-party registrar, FastDomain, to Postini (email addresses), and to Comodo (SSL cert. creation).

      2. FastDomain will respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, and will utilize Subscriber information as necessary to establish or exercise FastDomain's legal rights or defend against legal claims.

      3. FastDomain will share information to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations or suspected violations of these Terms, or as otherwise required by law.

      4. When we are threatened with suit by a third party, or any other legal action brought to our attention involving us based on the anonymity of the domain, we may seek assurance from you the customer concerning your promise to indemnify us and written notice that you have contacted the plaintiff or representative for the complainant and made your contact information available to them. Failure to provide those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in deactivation of your domain name and forfeit the right to privacy on a domain. A pro-rated refund will be issued to the payment method on file for the remaining unused service.

  2. **COOKIE POLICY STATEMENT**
    1. **General Purposes.** FastDomain understands that many of its Subscribers are concerned about "cookies", which are electronic collections of information stored on the local computer of a person using the worldwide web and which are used chiefly by websites to keep track of visitors and registered users and to relate one computer transaction to a later one. FastDomain provides this Cookie Policy Statement to let you, the Subscriber, know how FastDomain uses this technology. FastDomain uses cookies to help FastDomain improve its website and web hosting services, and, most importantly, to provide FastDomain's existing Subscribers with the opportunity for continued savings and increased convenience.

    2. **Cookies for Improving Our Web Site.** FastDomain uses cookies to inform FastDomain of a repeat visit. The cookie does not tell FastDomain who a visitor is, the visitor's name, email address, or Passwords.

    3. **Cookies for Subscriber Account Management.** For FastDomain Subscribers, FastDomain uses cookies to store user names for added convenience to the Webmaster. As part of our FastDomain web hosting package, FastDomain offers password-protected, web-based management tools. By storing a Subscriber's username in a cookie, the Webmaster will not have to fill out form fields each time he or she manages the account. (The cookie does not store Passwords.) FastDomain is dedicated to using the newest technologies in order to simplify our Subscribers' experience.
