# Privacy at FastWeb

**Privacy at FastWeb**

At FastWeb, we share your concerns about privacy.

The information that you supply to FastWeb enables FastWeb to provide the search and matching services that you request. In addition, FastWeb retains information about the manner in which you interact with its Web pages and combines it with information that you have supplied in order to test, revise and improve the FastWeb site. FastWeb tries to recognize you using various methods, sometimes including cookies. Once FastWeb recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. 

During the registration process, FastWeb asks you whether information about you can be sent to other organizations that have products, services and opportunities useful to students and their parents. FastWeb understands how important your information is to you. Therefore, FastWeb does not share any information that can be tied to you without your permission. If you give your permission, information about you may be shared with colleges, universities, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental) or other organizations. This information may include, but may not be limited to name, street address, email address, telephone number, or other data you provide during your visit to FastWeb. Information will not be shared with companies and organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful. 

You will receive email periodically to notify you of additional FastWeb opportunities. If you specifically provide FastWeb with permission, you may also receive some commercial emails. You can update your personal information by clicking on the "Update Profile" link in your Message Center or on the bottom of any email message you receive from FastWeb. 

If you have changed your mind and no longer want your information to be shared, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/fastweb/misc/privacy-prefs.ptml?ID=) to change your permission to share information. Once you have "unsubscribed," FastWeb will only communicate with you according to your instructions and will not share information that can be tied to you with others. 

FastWeb abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such, FastWeb will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13. 

FastWeb has security measures in place to protect from the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under our control. Information is used as stated above. You are the only person authorized to update your profile unless you provide your password information to another party.
