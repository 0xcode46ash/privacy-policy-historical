In addition to name, address (postal and email), telephone number and credit card information, we may collect demographics and opinions of subscribers or potential subscribers to our magazines, e-newsletters and web sites. Some of our sites collect data through on-site tools and applications designed to assist you, for instance, in wedding planning and other activities. As well some sites feature sections geared to businesses and professionals where business-related data is collected.

The St. Joseph Media Companies make all commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure that information is used responsibly and only for its intended purpose.

### What about demographic data that you collect?

The St. Joseph Media Companies will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in an anonymous aggregate form with advertisers and other third parties but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

### When do you disclose my personal information to others?

The St. Joseph Media Companies will only send personally identifiable information about you to other organizations when we have your consent to share the information or:

  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested.

We will obtain your express consent before using or disclosing your personal information for any purposes not identified in this policy.

### What happens to the information I provide when registering for site membership?

Visitors to the St. Joseph Media Companies’ web sites who register for membership provide us with a name, password and a working email address. We use this information to set up your account. We do not sell or redistribute the membership list and will not send you email at the address you provide, except if you have subscribed to one of our email products, or for infrequent announcements, or to resolve issues that may arise with your account. 

### What about the information I post on your public forums?

Depending on the site, the name or email address you register with us will be posted on our message boards and public forums if you post comments there. Remember that the information you post can be publicly viewed. You should exercise caution in deciding what personal information you will share in these public forums. Members are expected to comply with the rules governing the message board but we cannot control third parties’ use of information you may choose to provide in this public forum. 

### What happens to information I provide when I enter one of your contests?

From time to time, the St. Joseph Media Companies run contests and promotions associated with our web sites, email newsletters and magazines. We collect your personal information on contest entries so that we can contact you if you are a prize winner. If you consent at the time of entry, we may also contact you with product information from us or from our sponsors, advertisers or promotional partners. Contests may be co-sponsored by other companies with their own privacy policies. You should always read the entry form and contest rules before entering.

### Will I get advertising or promotional messages from other companies?

If you do not wish to receive these offers and mailings, click on the applicable magazine title for the mailing address of the applicable Subscription Department. Please accompany your request with a copy of your subscription mailing label.

###  What happens to the information I enter using your “email a friend” button?

The St. Joseph Media Companies offer an “email a friend” function on some online features and tools, allowing you to send email to friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading, images they may be interested in viewing or tools they may be interested in accessing. In order for this feature to function, we ask for email addresses for recipients (so we know who to mail the message to) and for the sender (so we can tell the recipient(s) who sent the email). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive email or other communications from the St. Joseph Media Companies as a result of having used this feature. Note that while the “email a friend” feature cannot be used to send mass “spam” mailings, the St. Joseph Media Companies have no control over how our visitors use this service and any email sent through it originates with and is the responsibility of the sender, not the St. Joseph Media Companies.

### What are cookies and what kind of information do they gather about me?

Cookies are small data files written to your hard drive by some web sites when you view them in your browser. Cookies and web server logs are used to collected information in an aggregate or non-identifiable way, and that information is used to improve your experience as a user on our sites, to improve the content of our web pages, to monitor the activity of our advertisements, to monitor traffic to and from our web sites, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor and for purposes of internal review. The information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our web site, the web sites visited just before and just after our web site, browser information and your computer’s IP address. (IP stands for Internet Protocol. This address is a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer on the Internet. All resources on the Internet must have an IP address.) This information is collected on an aggregate basis, meaning that none of this information is associated with you as an individual.  It may be shared with other organizations but only in aggregate and/or statistical form. Note that companies placing advertising on our sites have the ability to assign cookies to you in a process that the St. Joseph Media Companies do not control.

### Why do you ask for my phone number or email on letters to the editor?

The St. Joseph Media Companies’ magazines asks senders of letters to the editor to include a phone number or email address so we can make an effort to verify the identity of the sender should we need to do so. We do not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or otherwise disclose it to third parties.

###  If I send you an email, will my email become part of your database?

If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. Your email address will not become part of any other data base. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of non-electronic information, such as that received by mail and telephone.

###  I didn’t sign up on your sites or for your magazines but I received communications from you. How did you get my name?

We may obtain personal information from third parties such as mailing list owners. Typically, the personal information is provided to us with specific instructions on how it is to be used. We make all commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure that such personal information is used only for the purposes stipulated and that it is subject to strict terms of confidentiality. In the case of personal information obtained from third parties, we will work with list owners to fulfill the right of clients to know of the existence, use and disclosure of their personal information and to provide access to that information. 

### What about other sites that are linked to your site?

The sites of advertisers, sponsors and other third-party services may be accessible from the St. Joseph Media Companies’ sites. These third parties may collect information for their own promotions and offers and may have their own privacy policies. The St. Joseph Media Companies are not responsible for these third-party policies or actions and bear no liability for them.

###  What other steps should I take to protect my privacy online?

There is always the risk that personal information disclosed online in forum areas or emails may be intercepted, collected and used. The St. Joseph Media Companies are not responsible if that information is intercepted. You transmit information to anyone at your own risk. You should safeguard your passwords from others and take steps to keep your personal information safe. 

### How do I find out what personal information you have about me?

If you have questions about the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by the St. Joseph Media Companies or if you want to know whether we have any of your personal information on file you may contact our privacy officer by one of the methods outlined below. The St. Joseph Media Companies will respond to your request for access in accordance with applicable privacy legislation. In the event that we refuse access to you we will provide you with the reasons for our refusal upon request. Exceptions may include information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege. 

### The information you have on file is not accurate. How do I let you know the correct information?

The St. Joseph Media Companies will try to ensure that information about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date. We may update the personal information in our records from time to time, where current information is required for the provision of a particular product or service. Please inform us of any change of name, address or other information. Should you have questions about the accuracy of factual information we have collected about you, you will have access to that information in order to verify and update it. If we have disclosed inaccurate information about you to a third party, we will be pleased to contact the third party in order to correct the information.

### I no longer want to receive your email newsletter. How do I get my name off your list?

Every email newsletter we send includes an “unsubscribe” link. Simply click the “unsubscribe” link and follow the instructions and you will be removed from that newsletter distribution list.

### How do I withdraw my permission to use my personal information?

Subject to contractual and other legal obligations, you are entitled to withdraw your consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information. Specifically, if you prefer that we do not use or disclose your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes please send an email to privacy@stjosephmedia.com. Please note that your request may take three to four weeks to implement. We are legally bound to inform you that withdrawing your consent may preclude us from providing you with certain products and services.

### What security precautions do you have in place to protect my information?

The St. Joseph Media Companies have organizational, physical and technological measures in place to ensure commercially-reasonable protection against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information under our control. We review our security practices on a regular basis.

### I have other questions or concerns not answered in this document. How do I contact you?
