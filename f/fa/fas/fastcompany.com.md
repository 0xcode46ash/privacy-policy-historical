**5\. The search engine is not working for me.**  


**Using the search engine**
    The keyword search engine operates on **keywords** and spits out common words, so don't use articles or conjunctions ( and, of, the, etc. ) or really common words ( business, this, fast, etc. ). Try to think of what is UNIQUE about your search. Use plain key words without commas or any punctuation. 

For example, you want to find the story called "Four Rules for Fast Teams." The search engine cannot find the article because it contains common words ( the, fast ), which are not indexed at all. You will have to think of something unique about the phrase or about the story itself. 

Try "four rules teams" or "workstations whiteboards Cambridge Technology" 

**A particular sidebar**
    Often sidebars are included with the main story. 
**A particular story**
    As far as we know, all stories from the magazine are available online. If you cannot locate it using the indexes, lists, or search engines, then it is possible that we have misplaced it or do not have the author's permission to post it online. Contact [webmaster@fastcompany.com](mailto:webmaster@fastcompany.com) to alert us. We will make sure it is online, and notify you by email when it is ready for you to view.

**9\. Why is the site so slow?**  


**Hmmm...**
    The Internet is a fickle place. Sometimes a page takes forever to load, sometimes it happens quickly. The best first plan of attack is to try the link again, or refresh the page -- you should not have to wait more than a minute. Occasional traffic or server overloads can cause your browser to hang for no reason. This is a general Internet issue, not a fastcompany.com one. 
**Our Web servers**
    Damn fast, big fat Unix boxes, on redundant T3 backbone connected yadda yadda ... What can we say? Our hosting service is professional; the machines are superb; the connection is great; the diagnostics say everything is A-OK. Basically, we are doing everything possible to speed the delivery to you. The net is our connection, and sometimes suffers from the attendant vagaries. Such is life. 

**Please make your first comments to your own systems administrator or Internet Service Provider.**

Send us a note if you still experience consistent delays over several sessions, and are not having the same trouble on any other site. [webmaster@fastcompany.com](mailto:webmaster@fastcompany.com)

**Page size**
    Some of our stories are rather long. Wherever practical, they are cut into smaller pieces, and sidebars removed to separate documents. However this can be a real pain to print out. So we compromise, and have tried to balance layout, appearance, and printing performance. Long stories will take a long time to download, but we try to minimize delays. If a page takes more than a minute to load, try hitting the link again. It may have been a temporary glitch or overload. 
**Time of day**
    Our peak server loads occur weekday afternoons, EST. 
**Time of day**
    General Internet traffic loads occur and vary according to your specific location, and the performance of you Internet service provider ( ISP ).

    Our intention is always to gather only the information needed to serve you better, and never to gather information without your knowledge. We aim to balance our legitimate business interests with a level of privacy you would reasonably expect in the normal 'offline' world. 
    Anonymous information about our readers as a group, is collected mostly through standard analysis of our Web server log files. We use this information to closely monitor what areas of the site are used most and how to determine which areas we need to focus on improving. This information is used exclusively by Fast Company in aggregate form so that we may continue to improve the value of the services and information on the Web site to our members as a whole. 
    We also gather information which can identify you personally, generally to provide you with Fast Company services or products you requested and for Fast Company billing purposes.

    If your relationship with us includes providing one of our business units with Personal Information which is particularly sensitive, we will protect that information with extra care. We define Sensitive Data as including Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, mother's maiden name, personal financial data such as salary-specific information, specific stock holdings and net worth, information regarding someone's specific medical condition, and most information about children. There will be no external distribution of this Sensitive Data outside of our immediate company.
