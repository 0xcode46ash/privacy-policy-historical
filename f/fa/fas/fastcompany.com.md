**9\. Why is the site so slow?**  


**Hmmm ...**
    The Internet is a fickle place. Sometimes a page takes forever to load; sometimes it happens quickly. The best first plan of attack is to try the link again or to refresh the page -- you should not have to wait more than a minute. Occasional traffic or server overloads can cause your browser to hang for no reason. This is a general Internet issue, not a fastcompany.com one.
**Our Web servers**
    Damn fast, big, fat Unix boxes, on redundant T-3 backbone connected yadda yadda ... What can we say? Our hosting service is professional; the machines are superb; the connection is great; the diagnostics say everything is swell. Basically, we are doing everything possible to speed the delivery to you. The Net is our connection and sometimes suffers from the attendant vagaries. Such is life.
    **Please make your first comments to your own systems administrator or Internet-service provider.**
    Send us a note if you still experience consistent delays over several sessions and are not having the same trouble on any other site: [webmaster@fastcompany.com](mailto:webmaster@fastcompany.com)
**Page size**
    Some of our stories are rather long. Wherever practical, they are cut into smaller pieces, and sidebars removed to separate documents. However, this can be a real pain to print out. So we compromise and have tried to balance layout, appearance, and printing performance. Long stories will take a long time to download, but we try to minimize delays. If a page takes more than a minute to load, try hitting the link again. It may have been a temporary glitch or overload.
**Time of day**
    Our peak server loads occur weekday afternoons, EST.
**Time of day**
    General Internet traffic loads occur and vary according to your specific location and the performance of your Internet-service provider.

**We're in this together**
    At Fast Company, we acknowledge that the emergence of online business brings new opportunities and new responsibilities.
    We embrace the opportunity to provide our services to you in an open and personalized manner. But we share with you the responsibility of controlling the exchange, storage, and use of selected personal information about our readers.
**The information we collect**
    This site collects information about you, including your email address. In addition, information you agree to provide us when registering for our online services -- such as your name, title, company name, address, telephone number, fax number, and credit-card information -- is collected and retained. We may verify or combine this information with data about you that we have gathered from other sources or that we may already have in our files.
**Why we collect it**
    Our intention is always to gather only the information needed to serve you better and never to gather information without your knowledge. We aim to balance our legitimate business interests with a level of privacy you would reasonably expect in the normal "offline" world.
    Anonymous information about our readers as a group is collected mostly through standard analysis of our Web-server log files. We use this information to closely monitor which areas of the site are used most and to determine which areas we need to focus on improving. This information is used exclusively by Fast Company in aggregate form so that we may continue to improve the value of the services and information on the Web site for our members as a whole.
    We also gather information that can identify you personally, generally to provide you with Fast Company services or products you requested and for Fast Company billing purposes.
    We may also compile and use this information so that we may keep you informed of upcoming events, send you subscription information, customize your visit to fastcompany.com, and offer new products and services that may be of interest to you.
**Third-party use of this information**
    Fastcompany.com does not provide its electronic mailing list to third parties. We may be required by law, however, to disclose personal information about you to a third party. ( Personal information refers to your name, email address, street address, phone number, and so forth. )
**Sensitive information**
    If your relationship with us includes providing one of our business units with personal information that is particularly sensitive, we will protect that information with extra care. We define sensitive data as including Social Security numbers, credit-card numbers, mother's maiden name, personal financial data such as salary-specific information, specific stock holdings and net worth, information regarding someone's specific medical condition, and most information about children. There will be no external distribution of this sensitive data outside of our immediate company.
**Our use of cookies**
    Fast Company uses cookie technologies to provide simplified access to a few areas of the Web site by allowing you to save your details on your own computer. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser.
**Online advertising**
    Fastcompany.com uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>
    Please direct questions regarding our privacy policy to [privacy@fastcompany.com](mailto:privacy@fastcompany.com)
**Traffic analysis**
    Fastcompany.com uses WebTrends Live to analyze traffic to this Web site. Unlike some tracking services, WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles of visitors. WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data. For more information about WebTrends Live privacy policy, please visit <http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm>
