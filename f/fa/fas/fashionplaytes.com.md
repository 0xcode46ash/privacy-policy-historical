When you purchase from our online store, we collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. You provide this information so we can process and ship your order. We respect your privacy by not selling or sharing this information.

We do encourage designers & parents to sign-up for our mailing list. These emails provide you with advanced notice of sales, new merchandise, and other events. But, of course, you have the freedom to add or remove your name from our list at any time.

We encourage parents to be involved with all of their child’s online activities.

## Important Information for Parents

Under the Childre’s Online Privacy Protection Act, FashionPlaytes is permitted to collect the email address of a child under 13 in order to respond to a one-time request by them for information, — for example, sending an email about our website being launched. We use this information to respond to the one request only, and delete your child’s email address from our system after doing so. Only users over the age of 13 can subscribe to our newsletters.

## Tell-A-Friend Messaging

There are several places on FashionPlaytes.com where kids can send an email or SMS message to a friend telling them about the site or a garment they have designed. The Tell-A-Friend form asks for the sender’s first name and their friend’s email address or mobile phone number. The e-mail address or mobile phone number is used only to send a message with information about FashionPlaytes to the friend. It is not stored by FashionPlaytes or used for any other purpose.

## Links to Other Sites and Additional Site Features

Some pages (e.g. our games and chat areas) may have the look and feel of being on our site, however the information collected on these pages may not be covered under our privacy statement. All information collected on those sites is owned and controlled by that company’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement does apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites. You should read the privacy statement of our co-branded partner.

Our Site includes links to other Websites (such as our blog) whose privacy practices may differ from those of FashionPlaytes. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Website you visit.

## Does FashionPlaytes use cookies?

FashionPlaytes uses cookies (small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive) to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period, to improve the website, and, if you have registered, to recognize you when you return to the site. We do not store any personal information in cookies or link information collected through cookies to your personal information. You can always disable cookies on your computer by selecting the appropriate setting in your browser’s preferences or options menu.

## Tracking Technologies & Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

We use a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by FashionPlaytes only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party.

## Log Data

FashionPlaytes’ web servers automatically collect log data about visitors to our site. This data typically includes the URL of the website you are coming from, the Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of the visit, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. FashionPlaytes uses this information to learn about how our website is used, and to improve the site. We may share aggregated log data and/or log data that does not identify you personally with third parties.

## Web Beacons (Clear Gifs)

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at customercare@fashionplaytes.com

## How can parents update and delete info?

Designers and parents can view, correct, update and delete personal information provided in the registration process at any time. They will need the registered child’s first name, username, date of birth and password. Parents can prevent further collection or use of their child’s personal information by deleting that child’s registration or by unsubscribing the child from the FashionPlaytes customercare@fashionplaytes.com.

## Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from children under age 13, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of the child’s Personal Information.
