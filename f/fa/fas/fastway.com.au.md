Privacy policy
Fastway Couriers understands that privacy of your personal information is important to you.
We are legally bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), in the Privacy Act 1988
(Cth) and are committed to complying with the obligations set out in this Act.
What kinds of personal information does Fastway Couriers collect and hold?
The personal information we will collect from you depends on your relationship with Fastway
Couriers. As a customer or supplier it will generally include your name, business and email
addresses and contact numbers, and may include your bank account details. If you are a
franchisee of Fastway Couriers personal information collected may extend beyond this to
include your drivers licence number, vehicle registration number, financial details, photo and
date of birth. We do not collect personal information that we do not need. Our website does
not use persistent cookies.
How is personal information collected and held?
Fastway Couriers collects most personal information directly from you. For example, when
you become a customer, supplier or a franchisee you provide us with your information by
filling in a form, dealing with us over the telephone, email or face to face, by sending us a
letter, or by using our website. This information is held in hard copy and/or electronic
databases. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available such as from
other websites.
For what purposes does Fastway Couriers collect, hold, use and disclose personal
information?
We need to collect personal information so that we can provide our products and services
and conduct our business. Specifically, we need to collect personal information to interact
with our customers, suppliers and franchisees and often to meet contractual obligations to
these parties. Fastway Couriers does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third
parties. However, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties if required by
applicable laws, or to service providers who provide services in connection with our products
and services. If you would like to opt out of receiving future communication from Fastway
Couriers you can do so by contacting the Privacy Officer at the contact details set out below,
or by following instructions on the communication to opt out.
Security
Fastway Couriers takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of your personal
information. We frequently update our anti-virus software to protect our systems from
computer viruses. Further, all Fastway Couriers employees are required, as a condition of
employment, to treat personal information held by Fastway Couriers as confidential.
However, you should be aware that the internet is not a secure environment. We cannot
protect personal information before it reaches us.
Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients
Fastway Couriers may need to disclose your personal information to organisations located
overseas. These overseas organisations are located in New Zealand and are service
providers who perform a range of functions on our behalf including administrative and
technological functions and may include authorised external contractors. For example,
certain databases may be stored on servers located overseas. The overseas organisations
may include related entities to the Fastway Couriers group of companies. We are required to
take measures to ensure your information is treated in accordance with the standards that
apply in Australia.
Access to personal information and correction of personal information
You have the right to seek access to your personal information which has been collected
and held by Fastway Couriers. You also have the right to ask us to modify your personal


information when it is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, or to delete your personal
information. To do so please contact the Privacy Officer at the contact details set out below.
Requests should be made in writing and we will need to verify your identity prior to providing
you with access. We will promptly deal with any such requests for access.
Resolving your concerns
You have the right to complain if you believe that your privacy has been compromised or if
you believe that Fastway Couriers has not complied with the Privacy Act or the Australian
Privacy Principles. To do so please contact the Privacy Officer at the contact details set out
below. We will endeavour to respond to you within 3 business days, and to resolve your
complaint within 10 business days. When the nature of the complaint or other circumstances

frame.
