Like all websites, we utilize log files and third-party providers like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect and analyze traffic statistics using information like IP addresses, browsers, ISPs, date of access, time spent on the site, pages accessed and links clicked. This information is not shared with anyone and does not contain any data that personally identifies the visitor. 

**Comments:**

Fashionably Geek contains comments sections where readers can engage in a dialogue about our content. This service is provided through [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). For information on how your information is used, refer to the [Disqus Privacy Policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy). 

We try and actively monitor comments as much as possible, but this is no easy task and objectionable content might pop up from time to time. If alerted to a particular situation we will assess it and delete the offending comment if it is warranted.
