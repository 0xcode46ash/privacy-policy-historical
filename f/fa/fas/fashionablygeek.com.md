**Privacy Policy For Fashionably Geek  
**

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us at Fashionably Geek. This privacy policy covers the way we collect and use your personal information and its contents may be revised or updated over time. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please fill out our [contact form](http://fashionablygeek.com/contacttips/).

**Collection and Use of Personal Information:**

We collect personal information like names, addresses and emails on a voluntary basis and only for functions that pertain to our content (i.e. post comments, contact forms and contests).

**Use of Personal Information:**

The information voluntarily shared with us is not sold or shared with a third party. We do not send spam or other materials using the information collected above. If privacy cannot be preserved despite our best efforts, we reserve the right to disclose this information when required by law.

**Cookies and Web Beacons:**

Like most websites, Fashionably Geek assigns cookies to our readers in an effort to manage preferences, ensure functionality and collect information on the access of our content.

**Third Party Cookies:**

Fashionably Geek currently delivers ads from the following providers:

  * Google Adsense
  * Technorati Media Network
  * Chitika
  * Blogads



These advertisers may use cookies, web beacons or other technologies to better target and gauge the effectiveness of their advertisements. The use of these technologies is not controlled by CubicleBot, and visitors should refer to the privacy policies of these respective companies for more information.

If you wish to disable cookies, you can do so through your browser options menu.

**Traffic Reports** :

Like all websites, we utilize log files and third-party providers like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), [Quantcast](http://www.quantcast.com/) and [Sitemeter](http://www.sitemeter.com/) to collect and analyze traffic statistics using information like IP addresses, browsers,  ISPs, date of access, time spent on the site, pages accessed and links clicked. This information is not shared with anyone and does not contain any data that personally identifies the visitor.

**Comments:**

Fashionably Geek contains comments sections where readers can engage in a dialogue about our content. As mentioned above, a name and email address is required to combat spam on our pages. Again, this information is not shared with a third party. We try and actively monitor comments as much as possible, but this is no easy task and objectionable content might pop up from time to time. If alerted to a particular situation we will assess it and delete the offending comment if it is warranted.

**Contests**

From time to time, Fashionably Geek might request personal information from readers to fulfill requirements for contests. This may include shipping information, email and phone numbers. This information is not shared with anyone except the company sponsoring the contest for the purposes of shipping (please refer to the sponsor’s privacy policy for information on how they handle this information).

**Links to Other Websites:**

Fashionably Geek may display links to other websites. Outside of our sister site [Nerd Approved](http://nerdapproved.com/), we do not have any control over the contents of those sites.
