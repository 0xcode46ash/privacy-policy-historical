# FayObserver.com -

Welcome to The Fayetteville Observer and its online service, FayObserver.com, which also hosts FayObserver Blogs, email subscription newsletters, text message alerts and other topic-specific sites (collectively, the "Online Service"). The Fayetteville Observer takes your privacy seriously. Our Privacy Policy explains our policies and practices for collecting, using, maintaining, sharing, and protecting personal information. Our Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use Agreement (the "Agreement") between you and Fayetteville Publishing Company, owner of The Fayetteville Observer ("us" or "we") for use of the Online Service.

From time to time, we may make changes in this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any such changes by posting them here. Your continued use of the Online Service after we post such changes signifies that you have accepted these changes.

Our Online Service may contain links to other web sites, including web sites directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites. When you link to any other site, you should check the privacy policy of the sponsor of that site.

When you order subscriptions, register for services, offers, promotions, contests, or sweepstakes, access archived information, place advertisements, complete surveys, correspond with us, register for email newsletter subscriptions or text message alerts, or make other uses of the Online Service, we may collect personal information, including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone number, credit card information (only if you choose to make a purchase online), or demographic data such as gender, age, income, education, occupation, or interests.

Like many other commercial sites, our Online Service uses a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. A cookie is a small text file placed in your browser so that we can save and remember any preferences you set while using the Online Service. A cookie cannot retrieve other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your e-mail address. Cookies may be used to enhance your use of our Online Service. For example, cookies can securely store your password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site you have visited, and keep track of items you select in an online "shopping cart." We do not use cookies to gather personally identifiable information about you without your consent. Like many other commercial sites, our Online Service may count users who have visited a web page or recognize users by accessing certain cookies.

We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior so that we can measure interest in the various areas of our Online Service for product development purposes. The information we collect is used to improve the content of the Online Service and to enhance your experience when using the Online Service. We do not use personally identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Privacy Policy or at the time the information is requested.

We will not disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent, except in the certain circumstances, described below. We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information, including the names of those posting to FayObserver.com, when we believe the law requires us to do so or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary in order to respond to claims against us, to protect our customers, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business, or to protect the rights, property, or best interests of The Fayetteville Observer, its affiliates, or others.

We may disclose our statistical analyses or demographic data about users to third parties such as current or prospective advertisers or other business partners, but only in a form that does not identify individual users. In some instances, we operate shared web sites with businesses affiliated with us. Our Privacy Policy will apply to these web sites.

We have no control over the privacy policies of other sites to which our Online Service provides links. When you link to any other site from our Online Service, you should check the privacy policy of the sponsor of that site. We are not responsible for or liable for the privacy policies and practices of others.

**PLEASE BE AWARE** that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (such as your name and e-mail address) to third parties in chat areas, forums, or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others who are not within our control. This may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from them. We are not responsible for any information that you choose to disclose to the public, or for any consequences of such disclosure.

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of all personal information that you submit. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it. Other information collected from you is stored in an area not accessible to the general public, inlcuding phone numbers collected through text message alert registration.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) provides that web site operators cannot knowingly collect information from children younger than 13 without verifiable permission from their parents. We do not intend for our Online Service to be used by anyone under the age of 13 for any purpose, including for any service that requires the collection of personal information, through registration or otherwise. Our Terms of Use require that users represent and warrant that they are at least 13 years old. Therefore, we will not knowingly gather or disclose personal information about users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as required by law. Other sites accessible through the Online Service have their own policies about children's privacy. We are not responsible for their policies, and you should contact them directly regarding those policies.

You may use our online registration form at any time to change or update information you have provided to us. Questions regarding the accuracy of your personal information, the use of the information collected, or our Privacy Policy in general should be directed via e-mail to [privacy@FayObserver.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20101122093408id_/http%3A//www.fayobserver.com/help/privacy@FayObserver.com). You can also reach us by calling (910) 323-4848 or by writing to The Fayetteville Observer, Online Department, P.O. Box 849, Fayetteville, NC 28392.

We may occasionally send you information via e-mail about various products and services. You may "opt-out" of receiving further e-mail contact from us by clicking the "click to unsubscribe" link at the bottom of one of your emails, or by managing email subscriptions online at: <http://fayobserver.upickem.net/engine/Registration.aspx?contestid=9891>. You can also contact us at the e-mail address, telephone number, or postal address listed above. This will not prevent you from accessing and using the Online Service.
