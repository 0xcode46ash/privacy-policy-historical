# FarFetch -=- Privacy

  1. We record a name and address only where the person volunteering it explicitly agrees that we can use it. We refuse to accept any information considered private. (That's the reason we don't use encryption in the forms where personal information is submitted.) We use personal information only for the purposes we specify. 
  2. We provide visitors to our Web site with the tools that show them the information that we (and almost all other web sites) collect and store. This includes the URLs and times of access to each page of our site, the referring URL, the IP address and hostname of the computer making the request. 
  3. We use cookies to save login information, but only if you specifically ask us to.
  4. We accept feedback by email and web forms, but personal identification here is voluntary. Other than the data and methods listed above, we don't collect any other personal information by any other means. 
  5. You have the right to access, correct, withdraw and destroy any personal information we hold about you. Most of these requests are handled through the same form that used to volunteer the information. 



This privacy policy was modeled very very closely on [Junkbuster's](http://www.junkbuster.com/) [privacy policy](http://www.junkbusters.com/aboutus.html#policy).
