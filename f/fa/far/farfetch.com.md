# farfetch.com - a new way to shop for fashion

### BOUTIQUES & PRODUCTS

farfetch.com is an online marketplace that unites a network of independent boutiques. As such, when shopping on farfetch.com, you are able to choose from a very wide selection of authentic designer pieces that are available in the best boutiques in the world, such as L'Eclaireur in Paris, Penelope and Tessabit in Italy, Feathers in London, Henrik Vibskov Boutique in Copenhagen, Anastasia and American Rag in California and Bblessing in New York. 

Each boutique has a very individual and distinctive buying style, so when shopping at farfetch.com you have a rich selection of product to choose from, from emerging and niche labels or more luxurious and established designer names. You will find many items on farfetch.com that you will find nowhere else on the web.

We divide our labels into three departments: Luxe, Lab and Contemporary. These three departments each have a distinctive identity and host a range of different labels, allowing you to easily shop similar brands. 

  * [Luxe](https://web.archive.org/shopping/women/luxe/items.aspx) is where you will find the high-end of the designer offering, such as Alexander McQueen and Givenchy.
  

  * [Lab](https://web.archive.org/shopping/women/lab/items.aspx) is home to experimental and emerging labels. In Lab you will find designers such as b Store, Bless and Henrik Vibskov. 
  

  * Finally [Contemporary](https://web.archive.org/shopping/women/contemporary/items.aspx) features labels with a casual, urban attitude, including diffusion lines from the big fashion houses and premium denim brands. Shop Contemporary to discover brands such as J Brand and PRPS.
