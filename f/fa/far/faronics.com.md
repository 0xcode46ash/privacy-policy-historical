Faronics respects the privacy of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of providing a secure environment. We have made every effort to provide this.

Faronics may require you to provide us with personal information if you would like to participate in some activities on, or benefit from services offered on, our website. We have made every attempt to limit our personal information requirements to only that information which we believe is necessary to fulfill a visitorâ€™s request.

Faronics does not collect personal information from site visitors unless it is intentionally provided, such as when filling out a form.  
General information, such as IP address, web browser edition, and OS may be collected and used solely for aggregate statistical purposes.

Any information provided by visitors to our website will be used for internal purposes only, or provided to our registered channel partners solely for the purpose of allowing them to perform their contracted duties pertaining to Faronics products. Personal information will not be sold, released, or made available to any third-party outside of Faronics or its registered channel partners.
