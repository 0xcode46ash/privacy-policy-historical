### Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. The Company employs the use of cookies to ensure, for example, that you do not see repetitions of the same ad, to estimate and report audience size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at the Site. Any reporting of audience size and traffic is not linked to personally identifiable information.

Some Company advertisers use pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on the Site. Such pixels may lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers. The Company does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies.

Furthermore, the Site may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are collected and tracked by the outside media company. The Company has no access to or control over these cookies.

Most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled, the Site will still be accessible, however some sections of the web site may not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.
