# FARO Technologies Internet Privacy Policy

* **General**  
The responsibility for data processing in connection with this website rests with FARO Technologies  (“FARO”).  
FARO respects individual privacy and values the confidentiality of every visitor to its website. FARO strives to collect, process and transfer personal data in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, and has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices.   
This Internet Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles that FARO follows with respect to personal data it collects, processes and transfers using this website. 

* **Data being Collected**

  1. Automatically collected data  
In general, visitors can reach FARO on the web without revealing any personal data.  
Some data will be recorded automatically each time the FARO website is being accessed. Such data may contain IP-address, type of browser used, operating system of accessing computer, length of stay on the FARO website, areas of the FARO website being visited etc. Such data are of technical nature and, in general, can not and will not be used by FARO to identify individuals.   
FARO may also collect anonymous data concerning website users through the use of “cookies” in order to provide better customer service. Cookies are files that websites place on users’ computers to identify the user and enhance the website experience. None of this data is reviewed at an individual level. Visitors may set their browsers to provide notice before they receive a cookie, giving the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Visitors can also set their browsers to turn off cookies. If visitors do so, however, some areas of FARO websites may not function properly. Visitors wishing to control cookies in the ways described above should consult the user manual of their browser software. 

  2. Voluntarily provided data   
Visitors on the web may elect to voluntarily provide personal data via the FARO websites but are not required to do so. FARO collects data from visitors to the websites who voluntarily provide personal data by sending emails using contact data obtained by using the FARO website, filling out and submitting online questionnaires concerning feedback on the website; commenting, discussing or using other means of communication or feedback where such are being provided; requesting information on products or services; or seeking employment. 



* **Purpose for Collecting Data**  
FARO’s sole purpose for operating its websites is to provide information concerning products and services to its customers and employees and to provide a means of communication. FARO Technologies collects, processes and uses personal data using its website solely for this reason, unless there are more specific reasons, which will be stated explicitly when collecting that data. Particularly, FARO processes data so it may answer questions and forward requested information.  
FARO does not use data other than for its intended purpose in each case. 

* **Transmission of Data**  
In general, FARO does not transfer personal data to third parties without the expressed consent of the visitor concerned. Particularly, FARO will not sell or rent personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.   
FARO may, however, utilise third party service providers to perform under a contract or honor a request made by the visitor (e.g. when sending out requested information material by mail). Such service providers act on behalf of FARO and may have access to personal data needed to perform their functions, but may not use such personal data for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the applicable Data Protection laws and regulations.  
Third party service providers may also be utilised to collect and process statistical data as described above in paragraph 2.1.   
Personal data may be transferred to affiliated companies of FARO if and to the extend such transfer is explicitly requested by the visitor or necessary to perform under a contract or honor a request made by the visitor and such transfer is obvious to the visitor (e.g. if the visitor applies for a job offer made on FARO’s website by an affiliate company such application will be forwarded to such affiliate company). Such transfers may include recipients outside of the European Union and/or the European Economic Area, particularly to FARO’s holding company, if and to the extend such transfer is permitted by the applicable law and regulations including the Safe Harbor Principles.   
The companies in the FARO group abide by the Safe Harbor Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. 

* **Data Security**  
FARO maintains technical and organisational measures to protect the security of all personal data being collected, processed and transferred. Such measures will be constantly further updated and amended according to the technological development. 

* **Term of Storage**  
The applicable laws and regulations specify what personal data FARO can and must store and for how long. Once these terms expire, FARO routinely deletes this data or blocks it, following Data Protection laws and regulations.  
Where the storage of data is not subject to specific terms, FARO deletes it or blocks it once the reasons why the data was collected for cease to apply. 

* **Disclosure and Choice**  
FARO website visitors have the option to request disclosure of personal data of such visitor FARO may have stored, and to request that FARO Technologies may not use data previously provided, correct data previously provided, or remove data previously provided to FARO.   
Such inquiries should be directed to:

FARO reserves the right to modify or amend this Policy at any time consistent with the requirements of the applicable Data Protections laws and regulations. Appropriate public notice will be given concerning such amendments.
