# Blain's Farm & Fleet : Privacy Statement

###   
We Respect Your Privacy

We respect your privacy. For that reason, we have developed this privacy policy statement to help you understand what information we gather online and what we do with that information.

We encourage you to review the privacy policy statement. If you have any questions or comments about it, please contact us using the information provided below.

###   
1\. Information We Gather 

We believe it is important for you to know how we use and treat the information we receive and collect about you through this site.

In general, you can visit Blain's Farm & Fleet on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We do keep track of the pages viewed by each visitor, but none of the information we collect identifies you personally. Instead, our web server automatically collects some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your IP address, which is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web page you request) can be sent to you. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other visitors to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users. We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our site, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you.

Blain's Farm & Fleet collects personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, email addresses and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a visitor to the site. We collect information when you register online, update your account, log-in, place orders, opt-in to receive emails, shop online, and participate in contests, promotions or surveys. You can choose not to provide certain information, but you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

###   
2\. How We Use Your Information.

We use the information you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, providing you with discounts and special offers through mail and email, and communicating with you.

When an order is placed on our website, we keep a record of this information to process the order, track shipments and contact you via email, postal mail, or by telephone if we encounter any questions or issues with your order. You may also receive order confirmations and status emails from us.

You should be aware that Blain's Farm & Fleet will disclose specific information about you if it is required to do so by law, governmental request, process or court order if a good faith belief exists that compliance is necessary to conform or comply with the law.

If you would like to remove your name from Blain's Farm & Fleet's mail or email lists, please contact our Customer Support Team using the information found in paragraph 8 below. We do not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties.

###   
3\. Cookies 

A technology called "cookies" is used on certain pages of our site. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so the site can recognize you when you return. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse cookies altogether. Should you decide not to accept cookies from the site, however, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit the site.

###   
4\. Collection of personal data from children 

Blain's Farm & Fleet is concerned about the privacy of children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. We intend to sell our products only to adults. If you are under 18, you may use farmandfleet.com only under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

###   
5\. Links to other sites 

Our site may include links to other sites as a convenience to you. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its site(s), or its product(s) and/or service(s). Blain Supply, Inc. and the Blain's Farm & Fleet corporations are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any other site.

###   
6\. Security

We take our customer's business seriously and take measures to make sure the Blain's Farm & Fleet shopping experience is safe. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to keep your private information and credit card information as secure as possible. While we implement these and other security measures, please note that complete security is not always possible. 

###   
7\. Changes to this privacy policy

By using our site, you agree to the terms of the privacy policy in effect at that time. Because our site will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change without prior notice. We encourage you to review the policy periodically for that reason. In no event will we use information you submit under the current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to prevent that use. If you choose to visit farmandfleet.com, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and Blain's Farm & Fleet's Legal Notice, including any limitations on damages, disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concerns about this Policy, please email customerservice@farmandfleet.com with a description of your concerns and a member of our Customer Support Team will contact you.

###
