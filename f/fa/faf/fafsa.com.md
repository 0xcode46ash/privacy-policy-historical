We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We may also share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.

We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
