Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on Student Financial Aid Service's website. On some pages, you or your family members or others may subscribe to our service to register to enable us to create a record within our database necessary to complete your Federal financial aid application (FAFSA).

In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:

    Name
    Address
    Phone Number   
Social Security Number  
Driver's License Number
    Date of Birth
    Major course of study and other areas of interest
    Date you became a resident of your state
    Number of family members and the number of family members in college
    Ethnicity or race and nationality (for scholarship search purposes only)
    Veteran status of student, parents, and/or grandparents  
Estimated adjusted gross income and wages for the previous year  
Savings and investments (not retirement or insurance programs)
    Equity in other real estate besides your primary residence
    Business equity  
Farm equity

We use the information you provide about yourself when subscribing to our service only to complete the FAFSA and PROFILE financial aid applications, conduct a search for private scholarships, calculate your expected family contribution (EFC) using the federal need analysis formula, and assist in the completion of student and/or parent loan applications and special circumstance appeals, if appropriate.  We do not share this information with outside parties except the U.S. Department of Education's FAFSA processing contractors and college financial aid administrators from the school(s) you request the information be sent to.

We use email addresses to answer the email we receive and to provide helpful reminder notices and updates to our customers. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with or sold to outside parties.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that _X_ number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that _Y_ number of men and _Z_ number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Read more about our [security measures](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402013305id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/ssl.htm).

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  We are in the business to assist students and parents obtain financial aid for college.  Our youngest student customers are age 16.

You will receive a copy of the information submitted on your financial aid applications (called an Application Print Report).  You will also receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the Federal Student Aid Programs which is the primary document to use to make changes or corrections to your FAFSA record.  

You can correct factual errors in your maintained personally identifiable information by contacting us at 1-530-756-3446 or via email at [ support@fafsa.com](mailto:support@sfas.com).  You may also make changes to your FAFSA record on your Student Aid Report (SAR) as noted above.  The student will also receive an Acknowledgment form from the College Scholarship Service (CSS) if you requested that we complete the CSS PROFILE application for you.  For more information about making changes to your SAR, visit our web site at [ http://www.fafsa.com/sar.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402013305id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/sar.htm) or contact the Federal processing center (CPS) at 1-800-433-3243.   You may also request a duplicate SAR by calling the same number.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.  This is done by verifying the student's social security number and date of birth.

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402013305id_/http%3A//www.fafsa.com/contact.htm).
