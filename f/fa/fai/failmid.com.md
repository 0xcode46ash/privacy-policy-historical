# Privacy Policy - FAILMID

Just like any other website on the internet, we run statistical packages on FAILMID.com. These packages track things like what is the most popular post, how many people visited FAILMID.com on a certain day, how many people downloaded a certain software, etc. Any information collected by these statistical packages is strictly on how users interact with FAILMID.com and our services. All data is only used for analysis to improve FAILMID.com and our services (e.g. figure out which topics people are interested in). Information from these statistical packages is never sold, traded, or given away in such a way that may lead to your personal identification, except as explicitly stated within this policy (keep reading, bro). All information from these statistical packages is used in an aggregated manner. If you would like to know exactly what information these statistical plugins are collecting you can check them out for yourself: [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/).

We use WooCommerce to power our website and a record is kept of every download you get from us, including the information you provide to us (e.g. email). These records are to improve FAILMID.com and our services; we don’t share, sell, or give this information to third-parties in such a way that may lead to your personal identification (e.g. we don’t give your email to third-parties).

Third-parties is everyone that:

  * Is not part of our company, Azadi Network LLC
  * Is not part of the company (e.g. game developer) that has partnered with us to promote the game in question



The company (e.g. developer of the software being promoted) that has partnered with us to promote the offer in question may have access to the information you provide to us (e.g. email). The company (e.g. developer of the software being promoted) that has partnered with us may contact you; for example, to solicit feedback or to provide help or to introduce you to their other products. The company (e.g. developer of the software being promoted) that has partnered with us has explicitly agreed to protect your privacy and not share or sell your information outside their company. You should be able to unsubscribe from their emails if you don’t want them.

Outside of the statistical and WooCommerce usage mentioned above, ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SENT TO US IS ON YOUR OWN ACCORD, SUCH AS WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD A PRODUCT, E-MAIL US, POST A COMMENT, MAKE A FORUM POST, SIGNUP FOR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS, OR REGISTER ON FAILMID.COM. WE MAY SEND YOU E-MAILS ABOUT NEW GIVEAWAYS (THESE E-MAILS WILL NOT BE SPAM BUT MAY CONTAIN ADVERTISEMENTS — you can easily unsubscribe at anytime); also if the situation demands it, your IP may be compared to that of others to determine if you are a spammer or a repeat offender under a different name. IF YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING OUT YOUR INFORMATION THEN DON’T USE OUR WEBSITE. The Internet was not designed to be a private place. IF PRIVACY IS A BIG ISSUE, USE A PROXY, OR OTHER TECHNIQUES, TO HIDE YOUR IP ADDRESS WHENEVER YOU SURF THE INTERNET. Just be careful when using proxies, because many proxies are not anonymous and can in fact hurt you, in terms of privacy and collecting your personal information, more than not using a proxy. To learn more about what an IP address is, read [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address).

To earn some revenue to support the efforts of FAILMID.com, we run ads. One of our major ad platforms is Google AdSense ads. Google, and Google’s advertising partners, use special tricks to make sure they are doing good advertising. Here is the official legal blurb:

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
  * Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).



What Google does is out of our control. Sue them if you don’t like it.

By using FAILMID.com we assume you accept everything mentioned here. If you don’t, leave now. We hate to see you go. =(
