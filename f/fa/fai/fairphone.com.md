# Privacy Policy – Support

Your privacy is really important to us. At Fairphone, we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we really need it
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone, except to comply with the law, develop and deliver our products, or protect our rights
  * We use cookies to understand your preferences and deliver you the best online experience; some of our partner websites might also use cookies through our website 



By using our website you agree to our policy and you consent to our use of cookies (see more on cookies below!).  

Please make sure you carefully read our privacy policy below and contact us at any time if you do not understand something or you want us to apply a different treatment to your personal information.

**Website Visitors**

Fairphone B.V., a Dutch company with a social aim (“Fairphone”) operates the Fairphone.com website. Like most website operators, Fairphone collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, the date and time of each visitor request, and any other information the user chooses to send. We collect this information as we are interested to better understand how you all use our website and optimize our website.

Fairphone also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Fairphone only discloses logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Fairphone’s websites choose to interact with Fairphone in ways that require Fairphone to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Fairphone gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our subscribers’ list to provide an e-mail address. This data is processed and registered by (third-party service provider provider such as) MailChimp. Those who, for example, buy a Fairphone are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process the payment and actually deliver your order. This data is processed and registered by partners of Fairphone, who use secured environments to guarantee the protection of personal data. In each case, Fairphone collects such information only insofar as is necessary, appropriate or really useful to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Fairphone. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Other examples of our use of the data include: dealing with inquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website; keeping the website secure and prevent fraud; verify compliance with the terms and conditions, this privacy policy, the disclaimer or other applicable policies.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Fairphone discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, affiliated organizations, the purchaser or prospective purchaser of any business or asset that we are selling or contemplating selling. These persons might (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Fairphone’s behalf or to provide services available at Fairphone’s websites or (ii) perform their due-diligence in connection with our business and have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; It can happen that your data needs to be used by such partners of Fairphone. Of course we will see to it that your data is only used by them in accordance with privacy regulations.  Fairphone will never rent or sell (potentially) personally-identifying information to anyone. The only reason that Fairphone would disclose such information other then mentioned above is when it is required by law or government.

If you are a registered user of a Fairphone website and have supplied your e-mail address, Fairphone may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Fairphone. We primarily use our various blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of e-mail to a minimum.

Lastly, we will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. However, you acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet. Furthermore, you also need to take all reasonable measures to keep your data secure at all times. For example, you are responsible for keeping your password and other log-in details confidential. We will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to the website).

**Cookies**

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

We will use the session cookies mainly to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website, keep track of items in your shopping basket and prevent fraud and increase website security. We will use the persistent cookies mainly to enable our website to recognize you when you visit and keep track of your preferences in relation to your use of our website.

We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information, so make sure you read Google’s privacy policy as well.

Our advertisers, payment services providers or partner websites may also make use of cookies.

Also, please note that you can address the use of cookies via the settings of your browser. Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third-party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer (version 9) you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block All Cookies" using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Fairphone may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Fairphone encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
