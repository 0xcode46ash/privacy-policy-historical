### FAIR Privacy Policy

**Website Privacy Policy**

FAIR is committed to your online privacy. FAIR servers may record the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software and operating system you use; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the site, to diagnose and correct system errors, and to improve the site. We delete this information after one month. We do not connect this information to your name or identity.

**Email List Privacy Policy**

When you subscribe to FAIR’s email list, you will receive a confirmation message that you must respond to in order to activate your subscription. We will not add you to our list without your confirmation.

We will use your email address to send you updates, alerts and occasional event announcements. The subscriber list is kept confidential, so no need to worry about spammers. We will never sell or give your e-mail address to anyone.

You can unsubscribe at any time by sending a blank email message to the address that will appear at the end of every message you receive.

**Transactions and Online Giving**

For all financial transactions, our site has been equipped with security measures to ensure the safest transactions possible. These measures will work to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of any data under FAIR’s control.
