Information about you will be collected initially when you join the Fair Exchange Programme and will involve contact information (e.g. age and gender). This information will be used to identify offers that may be of interest to you.

Through your interaction with the Fair Exchange Programme, there may be occasions where additional personal information is collected through surveys, questionnaires, offers or competitions. In these circumstances this information provided by you may be shared with our commercial partners. The use of this information will always be explained to you at the time at which you are asked to provide it and will not be used without your permission.

Our websites provide links to our partner sites. These links will lead you to websites operated by third parties that operate under different Privacy Policies. Should you choose one of these links you will be leaving a PDV Ltd site for a site over which we have no control and we therefore accept no liability once you have left one of our sites.

PDV Ltd recommends that you read and understand this information.

PDV Ltd works with many partners to deliver offers to you that we believe may be of interest given the information you have provided.

By joining the Fair Exchange Programme through any of our data collection properties*, you are agreeing that you are happy for us and our partner companies to use your details to decide which offers may suit you best and then to get in touch with you about these offers, via whichever communication channels you have given us permission to use; post, e-mail, text or telephone.

PDV Ltd may, from time to time, use third party suppliers to provide all of part of its service to you. PDV Ltd shall only be entitled to disclose such of your personal information as is necessary to enable them to provide the relevant service to you. In some circumstances, such outside service providers may be based in countries outside the European Economic Area whose laws provide for a different standard of protection for your personal data than that provided under English Law. In such circumstance, PDV Ltd. will have in place contractual arrangements which will require your data to be processed securely at least to a standard compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998.

PDV Ltd strongly supports the principles of ‘permission marketing’ and will only send communications from itself and its partners where we have your permission to do so.

Cookies are small files of letters and numbers downloaded onto your computer when you access certain websites. Cookies unlock a computer’s memory allowing sites to recognise users when they return to a site. Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information but when it is read by a browser it can help a website identify you and your requirements.

PDV Ltd uses cookies as a means of limiting the number of times you may see a certain advertisement on your screen (a process called frequency capping) to ensure that you see the best range of relevant offers and adverts.

PDV Ltd also uses ‘web beacons’ as a means of tracking whether or not you open e-mails from us. This information is used to assess whether the message has been effective, both for you and us or our partners. The information is retained by us and used in deciding the most appropriate offers to be made to you in the future.

In some cases, we also track the pages visited when you click through from Fair Exchange to one of our partner sites. Note that this information is

  * Anonymous – no personal information is released or can be derived from it
  * Restricted only to our sites and the sites of our partners. We do not track pages you visit on the general internet.



Some of the partners that we advertise with require us to use cookies or action tags. These action tags provide those websites with the aggregate number of registrations to enable them to evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising. In some instances, we will pass back your email address to such companies as part of this assessment and the provision of rewards to you. The specific details should be explained in the ‘Privacy Policy’ or ‘Conditions of Use’ page of the partner sites. 

Some of the partner websites that advertise with us via our games, competitions and e-mails may well use cookies within their sites.

You may decide how you wish cookies to be used. You can make and action this decision within your computer and you can easily delete cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.

Most industry-standard web browsers have an option that allows you to turn off all cookies or have your computer inform you each time that a request to place a cookie is being made. If you turn cookies off (or refuse to accept a request to place a cookie) you may not have access to some features on our websites and our partners’ websites and you may lose the functionality of locating some of our services.
