# Privacy Policy | Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine

Revised November 9, 2009

At the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine web site it is quite important to us that we protect your privacy. When you send us an e-mail we may collect your e-mail address, land address, and sometimes telephone number. This information will be used by the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine for service, editorial, and communicating purposes. We will sometimes share your information with third party vendors who assist us with the preparation and mailing of communications. We will never rent or sell your telephone or fax number to any third party.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. The Foundation web site does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent.

The web sites maintained by the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine, including this one, may place a "cookie" in your computer's browser file. The cookie helps us recognize your browser and allows us to provide you with a more personal experience and better service when you visit our site. The cookie itself does not contain any of your personal information, so it does not jeopardize the privacy of your activities, or the security of the transactions you place at our site.

We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities and may, in our sole discretion, disclose personal information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request. We reserve the right to release personal information or other information about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Service, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate our web site or to protect the rights or property of the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine, our affiliates, or our officers, directors, employees, agents, third-party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful. If we are legally compelled to disclose information about you to a third party, we will attempt to notify you by sending an e-mail to the email address in our records unless doing so would violate the law or unless you have not provided your e-mail address to us.

To use some features on the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative Medicine web site, a user may need to first complete a registration form on the web site. During registration, a user is required to give contact information, such as name and e-mail address. This information is used to contact users about the services on our web site for which they have indicated interest.

Like most standard web sites, we use log files on our servers. These log files store information regarding IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. These log files are used to analyze trends, administer the web sites, track user's movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for our use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personal information.

The web site contains links to other web sites. We want you to be aware that when you click on such links, including banner advertising, which take you to a third-party or Licensee web site, you will be subject to such third-party's or Licensee privacy policies. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites and we expressly disclaim any and all liability for the actions of third parties or Licensees, including, without limitation, actions relating to the use and/or disclosure of personal information by such third parties or Licensees. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our web site and enter a third-party web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects their personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by our web site.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the message boards or in the chat areas of this site, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other message board posters or parties.

If we change or update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice on our web site. These notices will allow you to easily link to and view the updated policy if you wish.
