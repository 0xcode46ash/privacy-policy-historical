# Online privacy statement - Falmouth University

##  Introduction

Falmouth University is committed to protecting your privacy. We have a legal duty under the Data Protection Act to prevent your information falling into the wrong hands. We must also ensure that the data we hold is accurate, adequate, relevant and not excessive. 

##  Obtaining personal data 

We take great care to make sure that no-one can intercept personal information about you. Any personal data that we may ask you to provide via an online form will be held and processed in accordance with the requirements of the 1998 Data Protection Act and used for the purpose indicated. For example, if we ask you to submit personal data, such as an email or postal address or a telephone number, you should find a clear statement of: 

  * What data will be held 
  * The purpose for which the data will be held 
  * Whether any of the data will be disclosed to any third party, and if so, to whom 



If you subsequently choose to submit any personal data, you are thereby giving your consent for that data to be held and processed for the stated purpose(s). If you find that such a statement is not available, or if you feel that it is unclear or inadequate, please contact the [web team](mailto:web.content@falmouth.ac.uk?subject=Website%20Enquiry). 

Your information will not be used for any other purpose without your permission and will not be kept for longer than necessary. If you are concerned about providing your personal information online, we can arrange alternative means for you to do this. Please contact the [web team](mailto:web.content@falmouth.ac.uk?subject=Website%20Enquiry). 

##  Processing and disclosure of personal data 

We need to process information about our staff and students for administrative, academic and health and safety reasons in order to operate efficiently. We will only process and disclose personal data in accordance with our registration under the Data Protection Act. 

We will not, without your express consent, provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. 

##  International data transfers 

Falmouth University will not release personal data to any country or territory outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection to data subjects, except where the transfer of staff or student personal data to institutions outside of the EEA for the purpose of study, employment or placement is required. You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information. 

##  Contacting you

Falmouth University may distribute its own promotional material, or that of other organisations, which it believes may be of interest to you. You have the right to instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes by email to the [web team](mailto:web.content@falmouth.ac.uk?subject=Website%20Enquiry) at any time. (In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.) 

##  Your rights 

You have the right to a copy of all the information we hold about you (apart from a very few things which we may be obliged to withhold because they concern other people as well as you).

##  Cookie policy 

Every computer has its own individual IP address, identifying it in the same way as a telephone number identifies your phone line. 

We collect IP addresses only for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that while your use of the website will be logged you will remain anonymous to us. 

Our [Website Cookie Policy](http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/1774/menu/website-cookie-policy-4459.html) includes the list of cookies we use on the main website, [www.falmouth.ac.uk](http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/ "Falmouth University website"), and our key subsites. 

###  Use of cookies
