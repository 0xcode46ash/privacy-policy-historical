Our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, agents, or other businesses or persons may have authorized access to your information (such as name or email address and payment information) for the purpose of accepting deposits and paying withdrawals and processing such information on our behalf, including by using the information to make improvements to the services they provide. We will provide notice and upon your consent, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for their commercial or marketing use in conjunction with your FanDuel relationship or as part of a specific program or feature. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to your requests for customer service. As agreed in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms), we may use personal information about you (such as your name and photo) in connection with marketing and publicity purposes. We will publish a profile page that includes your username, the date you became a member, your stats from previous contests and, if you uploaded one, your profile picture. When you participate in a contest, we may publish your username on a list of the contest participants, along with a link to your profile page. We also may share personally identifiable information in other situations with your consent. 

FanDuel also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information that FanDuel believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms), take precautions against liability or harm, to investigate and respond to third-party claims or allegations, to respond to a subpoena, legal order, or official request, to protect the security or integrity of our Service, to report violations of FanDuel’s eligibility rules to third parties, including employers of individuals affiliated with other daily fantasy sites, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of FanDuel, our Users or others.

### Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through FanDuel, in which case FanDuel may not be able to provide certain services to you.

To protect your privacy and security, we reserve the right to take reasonable steps (such as requesting your password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information at all times.

FanDuel uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to FanDuel and you do so at your own risk.

### Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that FanDuel is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, or other change of control, there may be a disclosure of your personally identifiable information to another entity related to such event, and we may not control how the information is treated, transferred, or used by that entity.

### Third Party Advertising and Analytics Companies

Certain ads appearing on FanDuel are delivered to Members/Groups by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may use cookies and other automated technologies to collect data, including the technologies described in the “Information We Collect” section above. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, the ad companies may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and measure your interaction with each ad. This information allows ad companies to deliver targeted advertisements that may be of increased interest to you, both on our Service and elsewhere online. To learn more and to opt out of the collection of data on our website by third parties for interest-based advertising purposes, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). Note that opting out will not affect the quantity of ads you see online but likely will cause the ads to be less relevant to you. Note also that we also work with third-party analytics companies to collect data on our Service through cookies and other automated means. In some cases, the third parties mentioned in this section may maintain the information they collect in personally identifiable form. 

### Publicity

Except where prohibited, participation in a contest constitutes the player's consent to the use by FanDuel and its agents of player's name, likeness, voice, opinions, and biographical information for publicity, advertising, trade, or promotional purposes in any media or manner, now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, without further payment, consideration, notice, or approval, as described in more detail in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms).
