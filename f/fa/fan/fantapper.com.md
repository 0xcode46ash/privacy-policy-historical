Privacy Policy
Brand Affinity Technologies (BAT) recognizes that privacy is an important
concern to our users. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to
demonstrate our commitment to your privacy and to inform you of our policies
and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal
information we receive from users of the Brand Affinity Technologies site
(http://www.brandaffinity.net), the netBAT site (http://www.netbat.com), the
Fantapper site (http://www.fantapper.com), and the BAT, netBAT and Fantapper
platforms and services. Together, we refer to the sites, platforms, and related
services as the “Services”. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that is
provided to us through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from
time to time. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. By
using or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound our Privacy Policy.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS
OR OTHERWISE USE THE WEBSITE. THE USE OF THE WEBSITE IS
SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
Personal and Non­Personal Information: When using the Services, you may
be asked to provide, or you may choose to upload, certain personally identifiable
information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can
include your name, email address and other information that specifically identifies
you. For certain services, we may also request credit card or other payment
account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.
In addition, we may also collect other information that you provide or that is
provided to us about you when using the Services, such as pages viewed, what
features of the Services you use, your individual preferences and other data
which does not specifically identify you ("Non­Personal Information").
Information Usage: Unless disclosed otherwise at the time of collection or in
this privacy policy, we do not share any Personal Information you submit through
the Services with any third party, unless you have specifically opted­in to such
sharing or it is necessary to (1) respond to your questions, (2) provide the
specific service you have requested, or (3) comply with applicable law. We may
provide your Personal Information to our contractors who are performing services
on our behalf, but solely in connection with their performance of services for BAT.
We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party without your
consent except in connection with the sale or merger, in whole or in part, of BAT,
its assets or the division responsible for such services.
We may use your Personal Information from time to time to send you newsletters
, marketing or promotional materials and other information about the Services
and BAT, but we will not give your Personal Information to third parties to
promote their products or services directly to you without your consent. If you


decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from
us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the
communications.
We may use Non­Personal Information to improve and enhance your experience
using the Services and for our research activities. We may aggregate the Non­
Identifying Information we collect with the same kinds of information collected
from other users of the Services to provide you with a better experience, to
improve the quality and value of the Services, and to analyze and understand
how those Services are used. We may also use information you provide without
aggregating it to serve you specifically; for instance, to deliver Services to you
according to your preferences or restrictions. We might also use non­aggregated
information for development or demographic profiling purposes, but any such use
would not be personally identifiable.
Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose Personal
Information and non­Personal Information we gather as required by courts or
administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate
suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the
Services’ respective Terms and Conditions, or the rights of third parties, or to
investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.

management or use of personal data.

which case you may still use the Services, but it may interfere with some of its
functionality. We do not use cookies to automatically retrieve Personal
Information from your computer without your knowledge.
Log Data: When you use the Services, out servers automatically record certain
information. These server logs may include information such as your interaction

and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of other web sites.
Third Parties: The Services allow third­party companies to serve ads and/or
collect certain anonymous information when you and other Internet users use the
Services. These companies may use Non­Personal Information (e.g., click
stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements
clicked or scrolled over) during your use of the Services and visits to other Web
sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of
greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third­party web
beacon to collect this information. This privacy notice does not cover any use of
information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods
used by the third parties to collect that information. To learn more about this
behavioral advertising practice or to opt­out of this type of advertising, you can

and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to Personal Information to BAT employees, contractors and
agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or
improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations
and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution,
if they fail to meet these obligations. We have put in place reasonable physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee
that communications between you and us, or information stored on our servers,
will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties. You agree to
assume these risks if you use the Services.
User Communications: When you send email or other communications to BAT
via the Services, we may retain those communications in order to process your

functionality, we may collect and maintain information associate with those
messages, such as the phone number, the wireless carrier associated with the
phone number, the content of the message, and the date and time of the


transaction. Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or
otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is,
and will be treated as, nonconfidential and nonproprietary. We may use your
email address to communicate with you about the Services.

the age of 18. We do not intentionally collect Personal Information from children
under the age of 13. When we become aware that Personal Information from a

our database.
