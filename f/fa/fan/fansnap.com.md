# Privacy Policy | SeatGeek

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the SeatGeek administrators at [hi@seatgeek.com](mailto:hi@seatgeek.com).

Last updated on October 26, 2016

## We are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and buys on our Site or Application.

SeatGeek shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy (“Privacy Policy”) regarding the privacy of information we collect via our mobile application (“Application”) and website located at www.SeatGeek.com, including third-party apps, sites and platforms (e.g., social media services) where our ticketing products and services are distributed (collectively the “Site”). This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of Personal Data (as defined below) we collect and the kinds of companies with which we share your Personal Data. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices. We will comply with applicable federal and state laws that may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you or require us to provide you with additional notices. Certain services, which you may access via the Application or on the Site, are provided by our third-party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third parties. By accessing, browsing and using the Application and/or Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to the Privacy Policy described herein.

## Information We Collect

We may collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide to us while using the Site or Application. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number or email address.

## Protecting Your Personal Data

The Personal Data you provide us is saved in an environment that utilizes industry-standard security measures and is kept in our records to make it easier for you to use our services on return visits.

As part of our efforts to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we will employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. SeatGeek currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt your Personal Data.

SeatGeek limits access to your Personal Data to those employees who we determine need access to that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Personal Data. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers, nor can we guarantee that your Personal Data will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. SeatGeek will not be responsible or liable for any damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the Personal Data we collect to provide you with the products and services you purchase or use from our Application and Site, and to build features that will make the Application and Site easier to use.

From time to time, SeatGeek may contact you to request feedback on your experience using the Application and Site, to assist us in improving the Application and Site, or to offer special savings or promotions to you, as a user of the Application and Site. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by configuring your device settings accordingly, accessing the “unsubscribe” link included within any email and/or contacting SeatGeek administrators at [hi@seatgeek.com](mailto:hi@seatgeek.com).

## Sharing Your Personal Data

SeatGeek may share your Personal Data as described below:

### Certain Services

In order to provide you with certain products or services (e.g., tickets to certain events), we may share your Personal Data with one of our third-party vendors, or require that you transact directly with a third-party vendor.

### SeatGeek's Agents

Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, SeatGeek retains companies to help us handle mail and email (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and email), analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we retain to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Also, SeatGeek requires all third parties to which Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect your Personal Data.

### External Service Providers and SeatGeek Users

When you use SeatGeek to take advantage of any of our products and services, we may provide Personal Data to the ticket seller or other involved third party as necessary or appropriate for the transaction or as authorized by your use of our services. For example, when you purchase a ticket, a seller may receive your contact information and transaction data (excluding payment information) in order for the seller to complete the transaction. Similarly, when you purchase a ticket to an event (such as, but not limited to, a game or concert), we may provide your Personal Data to the teams you’ll be seeing, the league or organization sanctioning the game, a concert promoter, and/or the operator of the venue or facility hosting the event. Additionally, we may share information with an involved third party to assist in processing your payment with the seller.

#### Third-Party Companies

We may enter into agreements with companies (including, for example, by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website) that offer their products or services on our Site or Application (“Third-Party Companies”). As a result, we may disclose your Personal Data to Third-Party Companies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of Third-Party Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.
