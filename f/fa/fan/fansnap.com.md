# Privacy Policy | SeatGeek

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the SeatGeek administrators at [hi@seatgeek.com](mailto:hi@seatgeek.com).

## We are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and buys on our Site.

SeatGeek shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of information we collect on our web site located at www.SeatGeek.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of personal information we collect and the kinds of companies with whom we share such information. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices. We will comply with applicable Pennsylvania state laws that may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you or require us to provide you with additional notices. Certain services, which you may access on the Site, are provided by our third party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third parties. By accessing, browsing and using the Site, you acknowledge that you read, understood and agreed to the Privacy Policy described herein.

## Information We Collect

We may collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide to us while using the Site. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number or email address.

## Protecting Your Personal Data

The Personal Data you provide us is saved in a secure environment and is kept in our records to make it easier for you to use our services on return visits. Information collected by SeatGeek is stored in a secure database(s), accessible only by SeatGeek.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we will employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. SeatGeek has created a secure environment for credit card transactions. SeatGeek currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt all your personal information, which may include credit card numbers, names and addresses to prevent your information from being read during transmission over the Internet.

SeatGeek limits access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine need access to that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers, nor can we guarantee that information users supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. SeatGeek will not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with the Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the Personal Data we collect to provide you with the products and services you purchase or use from our Site, and to build features that will make the Site easier to use. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new and special offers.

From time to time, SeatGeek may contact you to request feedback on your experience using the Site, to assist us in improving the Site, or to offer special savings or promotions to you, as a Site user. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by contacting SeatGeek administrators.

## Sharing Your Personal Data

SeatGeek does not sell your Personal Data to anyone. SeatGeek may share your Personal Data with its subsidiaries and partners as described below:

### Certain Services

In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with one of our third party partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party partner.

We may revise this list from time to time if we decide to offer additional services through these or other third-party partners.

### SeatGeek's Agents

Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, SeatGeek hires companies to help us handle mail and email (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and email), analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Also, SeatGeek requires all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect your Personal Data.

### External Service Providers

When you use SeatGeek to take advantage of any of our products and services, we may provide Personal Data to the ticket seller or other involved third-party.

### Email

If you chose to opt in to receive promotional or information emails from SeatGeek, we will occasionally send advertisements, marketing material or other offers on behalf of other businesses that we think might be of interest to you. This material is sent by SeatGeek, and we do not give the other businesses your name or address. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please opt out of these communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email.

### Tell a Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.

SeatGeek stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your friend may contact us at [hi@seatgeek.com](mailto:hi@seatgeek.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

### Future Business Transfers

Our business is constantly changing. In the event SeatGeek goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.

### Compliance with Law and Protection of SeatGeek

SeatGeek reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with the law. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, or protect the rights, property or safety of SeatGeek, our users, or others.

### Notification

If none of the categories described above apply, we will notify you if we believe it is necessary and appropriate to share your Personal Data with someone else. You will have the right to tell us not to share your Personal Data.

## Our Policy Concerning Cookies

To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookie" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We use cookies to reduce the time it takes for you to submit purchase requests. No third party has access to the information we collect this way. You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. By refusing to accept a cookie, you will not be able to access some parts of SeatGeek.

The company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites, in combination with non-personally identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer.
