_Effective Date: December 21, 2011_

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.fansnap.com&sealid=101)

#### Background

On the FanSnap Site, we do not require fans to register in order to perform searches or select tickets for purchase from the ticket providers whose results we display. Fans who use our services are not required to provide us with any personal information, including their email address or credit card information.

Fans may choose to register with us in order to take advantage of certain special features and services we offer. We will collect names and email addresses from those fans and will use that information as we describe below. In any event, FanSnap passes no personal information to the third-party ticket providers to which we transfer customers for their promotional use.

#### Introduction

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways in which FanSnap uses the information fans provide to us, or we gather from fans, while they use content, data, materials, information, products and services through this Web site (collectively, the “FanSnap Site”). It is our goal to provide fans with the most relevant results tailored to their individual interests, to make this process as fast and easy as possible, and at the same time, protect fans' privacy.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before accessing or using the FanSnap Site. If you access or use the FanSnap Site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please do not use the FanSnap Site.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only covers information fans provide to us or we gather from fans while they use the FanSnap Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, on sites linked to through the FanSnap Site such as the Web sites maintained by third-party ticket providers who provide ticket data to, and make tickets available for sale through, the FanSnap Site or Web sites maintained by our advertisers.

In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms of Use. Your use of the FanSnap Site constitutes agreement to the Terms of Use as well.

#### Amendment

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes on the FanSnap Site. If the changes that we make to the Privacy Policy are material, we will post notice of such changes on the home page of the FanSnap Site at least 30 days before the changes become effective. You understand and agree that if you use the FanSnap Site after the effective date of any changes to the Privacy Policy, we will treat your use as acceptance of the Privacy Policy as changed.

#### What Information We Collect from You

We neither require nor collect any personal information from you, unless you decide to register with us via our signup links located on the FanSnap Site.

If you do decide to register with us, we will ask you for the basics including your name, email address and password and may allow you to provide us with other information including your team, artist, event and other search preferences.

To help improve the quality of our search results, we collect certain non-personal information from all fans, not just those who have registered with us, including IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, search history, click activity, time stamp and exit page information.

If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of the FanSnap Site and our services.

In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you for their own promotional purposes outside the bounds of this Privacy Policy.
