# About fantomaster.com: who we are - our privacy policy - 2007-06-29

## Our Mission

Our mission statement at **fantomaster.com** can be summarized in five straightforward words:

### Exceptional products — quality beats quantity!

The past decade's technological development has inundated the world with software and computer related services, including truly excellent ones. Thousands of corporations and individual brains make a daily point of developing the most sophisticated solutions. And even if — as anywhere in life — not all may actually be what it seems, overall users' standards and expectations have sharpened and qualified themselves in the course of recent years.

User value is the call of the day. Fair service is gaining steadily in importance — and the more people are becoming aware of the innate possibilities and limits of information technology, the greater the demand for specialized solutions: software which stands out amongst the mass market standard fare, which does what is promised and which, for a change, actually helps resolve more problems than it creates.

## Awards

The Spider Award

Ranked #1 in Category

This award is issued by the (immensely recommendable) Spider-Food site over at: <http://spider-food.net/>

Note that this is none of the usual convenience awards so abundant on the web.

To qualify, you must prove a Top10 ranking with AltaVista — no tricks like cloaking, doorways, etc., allowed, either!

There's an additional bonus for a #1 ranking (which we received as well for the keyword phrase — did you guess? — “cloaking technology”)
