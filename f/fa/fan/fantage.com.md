# Welcome to a Fantastic Age!

  
**1\. What information is collected and how is it collected?**  
As part of our registration, the only personal information we collect from our users is email address. Input of age is required so that we can identify which users are under 13 years old. Users under 13 years of age must supply the email address of a parent or legal guardian. We also have users create a username and password during registration. 

If you chooses to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Fantage does not store your friend's information.

When users contact us for customer support, we will collect their user ID and email address (along with a message) so we can respond to their inquiry and resolve any issues. 

Regardless of the feature you are using, we will not require you to give us more information than is reasonably necessary for us to provide you that activity. 

**2\. Passive collection of information:** Fantage.com may collect some technical information from visitors, such as, browser type, operating system, time spent on the site, IP address (for IP geo-location), and referring websites. This information is not linked to your personal contact information (i.e., email address). Fantage collects this technical information to help us better understand our users , in order to make Fantage a more fun and exciting place. Fantage or its service providers may collect this information through the use of imbedded java scripts, cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs. Users can disable cookies on their browser ; however, if you disable cookies, some functionalities or features on our site may not work properly. 

Some of our third party service providers may use their own cookies when helping us collect technical information. We have no access or control over the cookies or web beacons used by these third party companies, and this privacy policy won’t apply to their practices. 

**3\. What is personal information used for?**  
Your registration information is used to give you access to Fantage and to communicate with you about your account. For users under 13, all communications are sent to the parent’s email address. For example, when a child signs up, we will send an email notice to the parent informing the parent about the child’s registration and giving the parent the opportunity to set up the child’s chat permissions. We provide a similar notice to users who are 13 or older. We also use the email address supplied at registration for password reset purposes, to verify changes to account settings, and to send periodic newsletters and email updates from Fantage (if the user elects to receive them). 

Our Web site also offers a blog which is only accessible to logged in users. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.. Fantage collects usernames when users post a comment on the blog. All blog comments are moderated before they are posted to assure that they don't contain any personal information, such as, first and last name combinations, addresses, contact information, etc. Blog comments are also moderated to make sure that they don't contain any offensive language. Despite these measures, if you’re concerned about a posting that was posted to our blog, please contact us at [support@fantage.com](mailto:support@fantage.com). 

We do not share, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide personal information about our users to independent third parties. We may disclose personal information to government or law enforcement authorities if we are required to by law, such as by a subpoena, court order, or warrant or if necessary to protect the legal rights of Fantage or the safety of our users or the public. We may share your information if we are involved in a merger, acquistion, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. 

**4\. Isn't personal information collected when a user wishes to pay for membership or order products?**  
If you purchase a premium membership or eCoins we will collect additional information such as billing information and credit card numbers. This information is used solely to bill customers for the items/services that they purchased. Only persons 18 or older may pay for membership or order products. Payment information is not stored by our site and will be provided to our third party financial institutions or payment providers for the purpose of processing credit cards or other payments. These companies are authorized to only use your information to the extent necessary to provide their services. 

**5\. What if a child tries to provide information to other users?**  
All of our chat rooms are strictly monitored with a variety of security provisions. For instance, a chat filtering system automatically blocks personal information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses and home addresses. At various times, users may attempt to circumvent our filtering system, or some offensive material may get through. No website can filter personal or offensive material perfectly. However, our filtering system is constantly being updated and refined to provide continually improved security. Moreover, as an added layer of protection, our chat rooms are monitored by Fantage employees, whose job it is to screen out questions and answers that might supply personal information. Finally, users are encouraged to report other users who are bothersome or who ask intrusive questions. 

For the convenience of parents we offer three chat options: 

  * • Fantage Chat- Chat and user messages are filtered for profanities, and other personal information such as name, address, phone number. 
  * • Safe Chat- Allows pre-selected safe sentences, users are not able to type their own messages. 
  * • No Chat- Disables typing and viewing of chat and user messages 

  
Parents are able to choose the type of chat that their child participates in by using the link provided in their notification email or by emailing us at [support@fantage.com](mailto:support@fantage.com). 

**6\. How does Fantage keep your personal information secure?**  
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. All passwords entered on our site are stored in encrypted form. When sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) is entered on our website it is protected by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. 

**7\. How does Fantage handle information collected from European users?**
