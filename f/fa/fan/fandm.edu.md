# Franklin & Marshall – Privacy Policy

#### Information We Collect

When users visit the Franklin & Marshall College website(s), the webmaster collects information concerning their Internet connection, which pages they visit on the site, the Internet Protocol Number (IP) from which they accessed fandm.edu, and other general information about their visit to the website. Information associated with an individual IP Number may be used for internal diagnostics and investigation of misconduct or security issues. The collection of this information is intended to help Franklin & Marshall (F&M) deliver efficient and useful service, and it may be used to analyze trends, create summary statistics for determining technical design specifications, and to otherwise aid in monitoring system performance. Such information is stored on a temporary basis, and F&M will exercise reasonable care to release it only if legally mandated by law enforcement investigators, required by court proceedings, or deemed necessary to internal investigations of violations of F&M rules and regulations. F&M does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, information regarding the behavior, habits, or demographics of those who visit F&M-controlled websites. Certain parts of F&M website(s) may require tracking techniques to follow the user's progress through courses, materials or programs or to verify information acquired from other sources. F&M provides links to websites outside the fandm.edu network and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of any website to which it may link. Provision of links from official F&M websites to sites located outside of the F&M domain does not imply endorsement or credibility of the service, information, or product offered through the linked sites.

#### Family Educational Rights and Privacy

F&M is bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regarding the release of student education records and, in the event of conflict with this policy, FERPA will govern. A guide to understanding FERPA is available in the office of the Registrar. See the [full text of F&M's policy with regard to FERPA](https://web.archive.org/registrar/managing-credits/ferpa-regulations).
