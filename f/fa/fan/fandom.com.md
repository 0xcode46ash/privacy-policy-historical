**Privacy Statement**  
_Date: 9/11/00_

Fandom.com ("Fandom") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our Web site. The following policy describes how Fandom seeks to assure its visitors, and the parents of children visiting the site, how it protects information it receives from visitors to the Web site:

 **What information does Fandom collect and how does Fandom use it?**

When ordering products and/or registering on the site, we need you to create a user identification and password, provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and credit card information for purchases. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to Fandom, and receive back either the information or products desired.

When ordering products and/or registering, we also allow you the discretion whether or not to submit your gender, date of birth, income, and various marketing data and consumer preferences. This allows us to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you.

Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be receive Fandom`s newsletter, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from Fandom. Visitors will additionally be given the option whether or not to opt-out from receiving offers from our sponsors and other affiliated third parties. 

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new Fandom services, and special offers we think you`ll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other information request or distribution, simply submit such a request to Fandom at [info@fandom.com](mailto:info@fandom.com). 

**How does Fandom protect visitor information?**

Fandom implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Fandom`s databases to be only accessed as stated above.

 **Does Fandom use "cookies"?**

Cookies are bits of electronic information that a Web site can transfer to a visitor`s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow Web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor`s individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major Web sites use them. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on the site. Fandom uses cookies so that they can help provide its visitors with a better experience on our site. 

**Does Fandom disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?**

Fandom does not currently sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration, purchase, or contest submission. This information is used to better understand visitors` use of Fandom`s site, to support related transactions made on the site, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to them. 

However, such data, both in an individual as well as in an aggregate form, may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses in the future. Each e-mail newsletter always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to any Fandom mailing and request to be removed from any such list and/or mailings, or they may also send such a request to [info@fandom.com](mailto:info@fandom.com). 

**Fandom`s special note to parents**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children`s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect information from children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent legal guardian. Parent (or legal guardians) may provide us with consent to collect such information by e-mail, by facsimile or by posted mail. Parents may request to review information collected from their child, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of the child`s information. To request such review or to give instructions regarding the information we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should contact us as specified below under "Contact Us". 

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offerd online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to this or any other web site. Although guest under eighteen years of age may be allowed, with their parent`s permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent to such guest`s parents or guardian. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children`s online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the [Direct Marketing Association](http://www.the-dma.org/) home page. 

**How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have provided to Fandom?**

After gathering any user information, Fandom offers users the opportunity to remove their information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer interact with the Web site until they later chose to. Fandom additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by viewing their information sent directly to them following such a request from info@fandom.com, and updating and/or modifying the information previously provided. 

**Third party links**

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Fandom may choose various third party Web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Fandom, Fandom has no control over these linked sites who each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Fandom. Fandom has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Fandom seeks to protect the integrity of its Web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work). 

**Your consent**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Fandom as set forth in this privacy statement. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
