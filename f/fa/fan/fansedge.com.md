**Security Policy**  
All credit card and personal information is encrypted and sent to us using the latest in security methods, so online ordering with FansEdge® is 100% safe and secure. We Guarantee it. All credit card information is also then encrypted within our database. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, if fraudulent charges do occur on your card, the maximum amount for which you can be held liable for is $50, and FansEdge® will reimburse that entire amount. In the unlikely event that unauthorized charges do occur, please notify your credit card company immediately.

**Privacy Policy**  
FansEdge's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about you, our customer, to any third party without first receiving your permission. It is our desire to keep the Internet and your FansEdge® experience helpful and enjoyable.

FansEdge may share general information about our visitors and customers with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, we will usually talk about our users in aggregate terms, not as individuals. For example, we will say that the FansEdge® audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize FansEdge® content and advertising to make it pertinent and useful for you, our customers.

There are cases where FansEdge® may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We need this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with FansEdge® policies as well as federal, state and local laws. When we intend to use your personal information, we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may want to post the names of contest winners on our site or send you materials via email or regular mail at your request. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes (such as your address), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.
