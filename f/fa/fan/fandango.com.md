Introduction

Your privacy is important to Fandango. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. This information helps us improve your moviegoing experience with better content, services and opportunities. This policy tells you about the information gathering and dissemination that we conduct. As we continue to grow, this policy may change, so please check back periodically for updates. 

The Information We Collect

We ask our users to register when they use the Fandango site and services (collectively, the "Service"). Through our online registration process, we collect a variety of information about the user, which may include, among other things, such as user's first and last name, zip code, gender, phone number, email address, Login ID, Member Name and password. Fandango may also request and collect other information from time to time. 

We automatically track information related to use of the Service. This information may include, among other things, URL tracking information, what browser the user is using, the user's IP address, pages and ads viewed by the user and selections or other actions taken on the Service. We may track usage through cookies and/or pixels. A cookie is a small data file written to the user's hard drive. Cookies may be used to, among other things, allow automated log-in and may contain information such as a Login ID, an email address, or other information about preferences or Internet use. Pixels, also called clear gifs, are invisible codes that may be used on some of the pages of our site to provide us information to enhance future email campaign targeting and internal reporting. Reputable third party advertisers and technology providers that we work with may use or have access to cookies and/or pixels to help us customize your Fandango.com experience as set forth above but such third parties will not contact you directly. 

We also collect information about your movie preferences. For example, we may collect, among other things, information such as what movies you purchase tickets to or what theatres you attend. We may save information sent or posted to the Service. For example, we may save messages posted in our chat rooms or other message areas or feedback left for other users. We may collect correspondence, such as emails or letters, sent to us. We may collect user responses to online polls, ads, surveys, electronic newsletters and questionnaires.

Deletion of Information and Records

While Fandango may track and store information, Fandango shall not be obligated to do so and may delete any information and records, in whole or in part, at any time.

What we use the information for

We use the demographic information to enhance your user experience by, among other things, delivering you content that is relevant to your interests. We may use the contact information you provide us to notify you of new services or special deals that we or our partners are offering, to distribute movie related information to you or to conduct surveys or other similar activities. When you register with us, you may choose to opt-out of receiving these notices or mailings from Fandango; to do so, simply uncheck the "I would like to receive periodic offers from Fandango’s partners and affiliates” box on the registration page.

Fandango does not sell or rent personal information about its customers to any third parties at this time. In the event Fandango does sell or rent personally identifiable information in the future, you will be notified of this change via an email notification or an update to this privacy policy. If you wish to remove your personal information from any such lists maintained by Fandango prior to your inclusion herein, you may notify us via email at [support@Fandango.com](mailto:support@fandango.com). Fandango does, however, perform statistical analyses of customer usage in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various parts of Fandango's web site, and Fandango may share that information with current and prospective advertisers, and other interested third parties. This information is aggregated data only (such as statistics), and contains no personally identifiable information whatsoever. 

Please note that we may share your contact, demographic and other personally identifiable information with our theatre partners. Our theatre partners may share your information with third parties, which may result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, or offers from third parties. The maintenance and/or use of such information by our partners is out of the control of Fandango. If you do not wish to be contacted by our theatre partners, simply uncheck the "I would like to receive periodic offers from Fandango’s partners and affiliates” box on the registration page.

Please note that Fandango may sell, share or transfer personally identifiable information about its customers with any successor in interest (e.g. if the Company is sold to a third party). Additionally, in certain cases, Fandango may be required to disclose your personally identifiable information when the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation. 

Fandango users should also be aware that if they voluntarily disclose personal information in any chat areas or bulletin boards within Fandango's web site, that information might be collected and disseminated by third-parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third parties. This third-party conduct is out of the control of Fandango.

Security

Fandango has implemented security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We protect the secure areas of our site with a firewall.
