# Privacy Policy | Fanbase

This statement only addresses our practices associated with the Fanbase website. Other websites we operate may be subject to other practices. You have rights under California Civil Code §1798.83 to learn more about our disclosure of your personal data; to exercise those rights, contact [privacy@fanbase.com](mailto:privacy@fanbase.com). The effective date of this statement is September 25, 2008\. 

**Data You Provide Us.** You can provide us with data in a variety of ways. You can submit content such as articles or photos, comment on other people’s contributions, create your own personal profile with information about yourself and subscribe to pages you find interesting. In some cases, you can make some of your activities “private,” in which case they are not displayed to other members.   


**Registration Data.** When you register, you provide us with some personal data (including your email address). Third parties may also provide us with your registration data. After you register, you can tell us more about yourself through your member pages or elsewhere, and we may give you choices about who you would like to see this data. We use registration data for many purposes, including to improve the site, generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others, target ads to you and send emails to you. Typically, you can turn our emails on and off, but some administrative emails (such as emails about member agreement changes) are mandatory while you are a member.   


**Content and Ratings.** Our site allows you to publish content. The member agreement describes our ability to republish or stop publishing your content. We may publish some or all of your public member information with your content. We may publish your ratings, license the ratings to others, and use the ratings to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, merchandise products and identify/highlight popular members or submissions.   


**Interest in Third Party Offerings.** You may have opportunities to express interest in, or register for, third parties’ offerings. If you do, we will follow your instructions about providing your data to the third party (and we might retain the data as well).   


**Surveys.** We treat your survey responses like we treat our other business records.   


**Accessing Your Records.** The information described in California Business & Professions Code Sec. 1798.83 is available by submitting the required information to [privacy@fanbase.com](mailto:privacy@fanbase.com).   


**Data We Collect Automatically.** As part of our servers’ normal operations, we log your IP address and referring/destination URLs. We use this data, as well as other server usage data, to analyze site and user behavior, improve the site, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others. If you contribute content to the site, we may republish your IP address and location.   


We use cookies. To become a member or contributor, you need to accept our cookies. We and our third party vendors (such as our web analytics service provider) may use cookies and web beacons to analyze site usage, improve the site, target ads, store your preferences/passwords (if you’ve registered), personalize your experience (including tracking your site usage to do so) and generate reports of aggregated activity that we may share with others.   


**Other Data Collection.** We may get data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this statement. For example, you might contact Customer Service, or we may get a third party complaint about you. We handle this data like our other business records.   


**Data Changes.** To the extent you or third parties modify or delete your data or content, we usually update our live databases immediately, but some data may update more slowly, and some old data and content may remain indefinitely in our archives and records. In particular, any published content may remain in the publicly accessible history of the page, even if it is removed or changed elsewhere. Also, we may be unable to propagate changes to partners who receive your data or content.   


**Contractors/Service Providers.** Third party contractors may have access to our databases. Usually these contractors sign a standard confidentiality agreement.   


Some of our site’s functionality may be operated by third party service providers, and in the course of providing this functionality, these service providers may obtain some of your personal data from you directly or transferred from us to facilitate your usage of this service. Usually we require these providers to use and disclose your personal data only as necessary to perform their services.   


Third party ad servers may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.   


**Our “Corporate Family.”** We may share your data with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, other entities under a common control or third party acquirers. We expect these other entities will honor this statement. Also, we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our databases, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase.   


**Government Relations and Lawsuits.** You consent to us disclosing your data or data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential legal proceedings (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures might mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.   


**Communicating with Other Users.** Except as authorized by our robots.txt page or with our permission (email [data@fanbase.com](mailto:data@fanbase.com)), you may not use any automated means (such as a robot, spider, scraper or script) to access Fanbase or collect information from it. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not collect (manually or in an automated manner) other users’ personal data (including email addresses) from the site.   


**Children.** Unfortunately, our site is not designed for children 12 and under. Do not submit any information about children 12 and under, and if you are 12 and under, do not use the site or provide any data to us.   


**Limits on Our Abilities.** Our site is very complicated, so we might inadvertently use or disclose your data in ways inconsistent with this statement. For example, a temporary software glitch could lead to public display of your personal data despite your contrary preferences. We might also make ad hoc uses of your data in ways not mentioned here. In these anomalous situations, your sole remedy is that we will try to rectify the anomaly as soon as we can.   


**Security.** We use industry-standard security protocols, such as (if and where we think appropriate) firewalls and restrictions on which employees can access user data. However, perfect security does not exist on the Internet.   


**Amendment.** This privacy statement is part of the Fanbase contributor and member agreement and, for members, can be modified in accordance with the amendment procedures described in the member agreement.
