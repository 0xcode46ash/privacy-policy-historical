# Utility Page - Fantasy Football Cafe 2013

On this page, you can find out how to write for the Cafe, whom to contact for what as well as a statement on our firm commitment to privacy. Once you're here, we'd also be particularly happy if you would participate in our [Site Survey](https://web.archive.org/survey_start.php), which is located [here](https://web.archive.org/survey_start.php). Interested in having your football writing published? Want to share your thoughts with the fantasy community? Fantasy Football Cafe welcomes submissions of interesting, original, and well-written articles.

Among the subjects we run in the Cafe's [Articles](https://web.archive.org/tips.php) section are: fantasy strategy, opinion and commentary on a wide range of football topics, as long as they are previously unpublished (humor is always a plus and so is good writing style, of course). We also welcome submissions for our [Sleepers](https://web.archive.org/sleepers.php) column, participation in the Cafe's [Player Rankings](https://web.archive.org/player_rankings.php) as well as a helping hand in the editing room.

For details, please check out the Cafe's [Pencil and Paper](https://web.archive.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=233) forum (you need to [register](https://web.archive.org/forums/ucp.php?mode=register) to view this place - takes a moment of your time but will hopefully be worth it), or send an email to [headscribe@fantasycafe.com](mailto:headscribe@fantasycafe.com) with any questions you may have.

Keep in mind that the Cafe is a free community site, so while we can pay you in respect and you will earn the gratitude of other Cafe visitors, we cannot add any hard cash to your reward. However, Cafe writers receive considerable exposure for their work, so even if you are striving for a professional writer's career and plan to become filthy rich in the process, the Cafe may be an important stepping stone to showcase and improve your skills.

Looking forward to featuring your articles at the Cafe!
