# Privacy Policy | Fabletics

This privacy policy addresses how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. By visiting Fabletics.com (this "Site"), or providing your information to us, you agree to accept the practices described in this privacy policy.

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION   
When you register and create a member account through this Site ("Account"), we request certain personally identifiable information from you, including contact information (such as name, email and shipping and billing addresses) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date).

HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
We use your personal information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have any questions or concerns regarding your order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also use your information to contact you for promotional purposes. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. We will also use this information internally to make our services more rewarding for you to use, such as studying our customers' preferences and improving the customers' experiences. We may combine information about you with information from other sources in order to improve the quality of our services.

  * We may share information about you with trusted third parties in order to improve your consumer experience. These third parties may contact you about products, services or promotions you may be interested in, or to otherwise improve your customer experience with this Site.
  * Your information may be transferred in connection with the sale, merger or business acquisition of Fabletics and/or Just Fabulous, Inc.
  * When we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of JustFab, its users or the public.
  * As required by law, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, to exercise our rights, or to defend against any claims.



COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS   
The Site uses cookies and web beacons to gather aggregated, non-personally identifiable information in order to help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Such information may be shared with trusted third-parties but the information will not personally identify you. To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information. As we develop this Site, we may gather additional information from you through the use of other technologies.

Cookie  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to collect anonymous information about how you use this Site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often you visit our Site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave our Site. The cookies are not connected to your personal information.

Web Beacon  
Web beacons, or clear gifs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. Web beacons help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to your personal information.

SECURITY  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. If you have any questions about security on our Site, please contact us as indicated below.

OPTING OUT  
We may occasionally send you newsletters and emails regarding special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates. We may also communicate with you on behalf of third parties about special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates we think may be of interest to you, or you may have opted-in to receive newsletters or special promotions from one of our trusted third party providers. If you decide you do not wish to receive these communications, you may opt-out by clicking the unsubscribe link or by following the instructions included in the communication.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
