When you use your Rewards Member number at the time of checkout, we will also collect information about your purchases. This information is used to reward loyal customers for their purchases and to determine what products and offers may be of particular interest to you. By becoming a Rewards Member, you are able to earn points for purchases made online, and in-store, as well as take advantage of special offers we make available. Rewards Members may receive offers and information about new promotions, fashion trends, etc. via email message or text message (SMS) if opt-in complete (SMS not available in Canada). It is also more convenient for a Rewards Member to make purchases online. In order to earn points for online purchases, you must enter your Rewards Member number at time of checkout.

#### Online Orders

We request information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. Online orders placed at famous.com can only be shipped to a physical U.S. address, excluding P.O. and CPO Boxes.

#### Retail

We may require government-issued identification or collect personal information, such as your name, address and telephone number, when you return or exchange merchandise in-store. We use this information for the purposes of processing the transaction, maintaining records, and detecting and preventing fraud. We may also collect personal information, such as name, telephone number, or email address, if you contact a store or our consumer care team with a question, concern or complaint, so that we may respond appropriately. In addition, you may be asked for your email address if you express interest or agree to receive electronic sales receipts and emails about new promotions, fashion trends, etc. Providing your email address at our retail locations is strictly optional.

#### Special Offers

Rewards Members will occasionally receive information on products, services, and special promotions. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see "Choice and Opt-Out" below.

#### Surveys and Contests 

Occasionally, we may request information from customers via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip/postal code, age level). Contest information will be used to administer the contest, including notifying the winners and awarding prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of evaluating, monitoring, or improving our business or this site.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the hard drive of your computer, containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies can make the browsing experience easier. For instance, by accepting a cookie from our site, you will not have to type in your password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Most browsers can be set to reject cookies or to ask you if you want to accept/reject an incoming cookie. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site, although you will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our customers to enhance the experience on our site.

#### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

#### Sharing

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 

We may partner with other parties (including affiliated companies) from time to time to provide specific services on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, data hosting and processing, and similar services. The personal information we collect may be shared with these other parties so that they may provide these services to us. Note that some of these other parties and affiliates may be located outside of the country in which you reside, including in the United States, and your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, stored and processed in such jurisdictions for the purposes described in this privacy policy. 

We may combine the personal information we collect, such as your order information and contact information, with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be disclosed to and used by our marketing partners or other carefully screened companies whose products may be of interest to you. 

If you prefer we do not share this information with our marketing partners or other carefully screened companies, please see the Choice and Opt-out section below. If you agree and consent to receive email from our marketing partners, we will share with them your email address and the information described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. We will only share this information if you have opted in and provided consent by selecting Submit or Sign Up when prompted to enter your email address to “Sign up for trend updates & special offers.” Additionally, our agreements with our partners require that each email our partners send you will include a description of the simple opt-out process to enable you to stop receiving future emails. 

#### Links

From time to time, famous.com may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. The privacy policy you are currently reading applies solely to information collected by famous.com.

#### Security

We take steps to protect our customers’ information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification, both online and off-line

When our online registration form or order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a secure page, such as our order form, web browsers (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari) change to “locked” status as opposed to un-locked, or open, status used for general internet searches or browsing.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also strive to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only Associates who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a Consumer Care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all Associates are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our Associates are regularly notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

If you have questions about our information security practices, contact Famous Footwear Consumer Care. 

#### Site and Service Updates

It is sometimes necessary to email our users regarding site and/or service updates. For issues directly relating to your account, or to provide services you’ve requested, we may communicate with you by either email or phone. 

#### Correcting or Updating Personal Information

If your personal information changes (such as your email, or zip/postal code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way for you to correct, update or remove your personal information provided to us. This can be done at the [Rewards Customer Account](https://secure.famousfootwear.com/Profiles/Login.aspx?rewards=Y) information page (US Rewards Members only) or by contacting Famous Footwear Consumer Care.

#### Choice and Opt-out

Our online visitors are given the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our [Rewards Customer Account](https://secure.famousfootwear.com/Profiles/Login.aspx?rewards=Y) information form (US Rewards Members only) has an opt-out mechanism so users who register with us, but don't want any marketing material or those of our marketing partners, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

If you previously agreed to receive our promotional materials and no longer wish to receive them, you may opt out of receiving these communications by either visiting our [Rewards Customer Account](https://secure.famousfootwear.com/Profiles/Login.aspx?rewards=Y) information page (US Rewards Members only) or by contacting Famous Footwear Consumer Care. 

Users of our site are notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

#### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users always have access to details about the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this different manner. Otherwise, we will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

#### Contact Information

If you wish to request access to, or correction of, your personal information in the custody or control of BG Retail, LLC. or Caleres Canada, Inc., if you have any questions or would like to make a complaint, or if you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional materials from BG Retail, LLC. or Caleres Canada, Inc., please use the information below to contact us.
