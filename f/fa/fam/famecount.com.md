**Social Network Trend Data**  
The statistical data displayed on our website, and used across our various services, relates to usage and trends within major social networks, such as Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, Google+, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Youku, Orkut, Mixi, VKontakte, Renren and other services.

With the exception of data which users have specifically given us access to, through inputting directly on our site, all the data we display is either: 

* 1.) Publicly accessible from social networks without authentication. Celebrity and brand chart categorisations / biogs and other such data is derived from what is displayed publicly on the social networks or on other public sources such as wikipedia and news reports. Currently anyone surfing the internet can access this social network information we publish, from the sites themselves without registration, from search engines, and from any applications (such as ours) that utilise the APIs of these services.
* Your consent to your publically accessible data from the social networks being displayed on our website is based on your privacy settings on the social networks themselves. If you do not wish for your data to appear on services like ourselves, the best solution is to change your privacy settings on the social networks themselves or, if not possible or preferred, to remove your accounts from those networks. If, after changing privacy settings or deleting accounts on these social networks, you still for any reason notice personal data on our site please contact us.

OR

* 2.) Data that you have specifically consented to provide to starcount – through connecting with a social network. If you authenticate with starcount using a social network (for example, as part of the registration process for our Fan Charts) you will be asked as part of that process to make available certain information from those networks. By consenting to this, you consent to provide your data to starcount for use and display on our services.
* We shall only publish or utilise non-public data from social networks where we have requested that we include, and you have granted us access to, such data, through this process. If you do grant access to this data, you may revoke such access at any time. And you may also remove yourself from starcount.com completely by deleting your account in your user settings at starcount.com.
