Currently anyone surfing the Internet can access this Social Network information we publish, from the websites themselves without registration, from search engines, and from any applications (such as ours) that utilise the APIs of these services. Your consent to our use of your publicly available data from the Social Networks being displayed on the Site is based on your privacy settings on the Social Networks themselves.
