**Social Network Trend Data**  
The statistical data displayed on our website relates to usage and trends within major social networks, such as Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, Google+, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Youku, Orkut, Mixi, VKontakte, Renren and other services.

With the exception of data which users have specifically given us access to, through registering and connecting on our site, all the data we display is publicly accessible. Statistical data is taken direct from the social networks. Chart categorisations / biogs and other such data is either derived from what is displayed publicly on the social networks, or from other public sources such as wikipedia and news reports. Currently anyone surfing the internet can access the social network information we publish, from the sites themselves without registration, from search engines, and from any applications (such as ours) that utilise the APIs of these services.

Your consent to your publically accessible data from the social networks being displayed on our website is based on your privacy settings on the social networks. If you do not wish for your data to appear on services like ourselves, the best solution is to change your privacy settings on the social networks themselves or, if not possible or preferred, to remove your accounts from those networks. If, after changing privacy settings or deleting accounts on these social networks, you still for any reason notice personal data on our site please contact us.

We shall only publish or utilise non-public data from social networks where the respective users have specifically requested that we include and have granted us access to their data. If you do grant access to this data, you may revoke such access at any time.   
If there are particular concerns you have with our trend data, then please contact us. [team@starcount.com](mailto:team@starcount.com)
