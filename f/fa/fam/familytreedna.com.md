# Family Tree DNA - Privacy Policy

Family Tree DNA follows stringent policies for protecting your privacy according to state legislation guidelines. We control the Surname Database Library and genetic testing scores. Family Tree DNA only shares limited information with testing facilities. Family Tree DNA and our Genomics Research Center follow strict guidelines to ensure your privacy. 

In addition to the PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT below, Family Tree DNA also adheres to the [Genetic Genealogy Guidelines](http://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com/) as proposed by the The Genetic Genealogy Standards Committee in January 2015. 

In addition to the PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY STATEMENT below, Family Tree DNA also adheres to the following [SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY STATEMENT](https://web.archive.org/pdf-docs/FTDNA-Safe-Harbor-Standards-07-2012.pdf) in connection with the transfer and protection of "personal information" received from the European Union (EU) or Switzerland. 

Family Tree DNA complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Family Tree DNA has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Family Tree DNA’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Family Tree DNA commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Family Tree DNA by emailing us at helpdesk@familytreedna.com, with the word SAFEHARBOR in the subject line. Any correspondence without SAFEHARBOR in the subject line will not receive a response. 

Family Tree DNA has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Family Tree DNA, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](https://web.archive.org/web/20150618232727id_/https%3A//www.familytreedna.com/www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint. 

Family Tree DNA accepts the responsibility to keep your specific data private, at the same time, making enough general information public to allow us to build a Surname Database library usable for genealogical purposes. 

### To accomplish this Family Tree DNA allows you to do the following:

You may search the existing Surname Database Library to see if the surname you are searching is already there. If it is, you may order your DNA test kit and return to search to see that the database has increased under your surname. If the name you want to search is not there, you may order your test kit and then return to the database to see your surname registered. 

Family Tree DNA maintains strict privacy and confidentiality. 

Your unique test kit number will accompany your collection tube to the testing lab. The computer-generated number and your surname are the only information about you that the testing facility will see. Once the lab completes your DNA test, Family Tree DNA enters the test results in a secure database. We then perform a comparison between your specific genetic results and those of others in the database. 

If the matching program finds a genetic match between you and another person in the database, and you have each signed the [release form](https://web.archive.org/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf) Family Tree DNA will notify you via e-mail. 

If a genetic match is found between you and another individual who enters the library at some time in the future, both will be given the information that a potential match is in the database provided that BOTH of you have signed the [release form](https://web.archive.org/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf). Only where both parties have signed the release form will we release contact information concerning the separate parties to the other party. In this way, all persons in the database will have the right to decide if they want to contact their genetic match(es). 

For users that signed the [release form](https://web.archive.org/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf), Family Tree DNA may show your ethnicity breakdown to your genetic matches. However, you can opt-out of sharing your ethnicity and keep your results private with only you and the administrators of projects to which you belong by modifying your privacy settings [here](https://web.archive.org/my/privacy-sharing.aspx). 

Please read the [Settings – Privacy & Sharing Page](https://www.familytreedna.com/learn/user-guide/my-account/account-privacy-sharing-page/) on our Learning Center for more information regarding your privacy settings and permissions. 

If a person consents to testing that is paid for by another party, that person is consenting to allow that individual or group project access to their results and information, even if they order and pay for additional testing later. The purchaser of a test cannot deny access to the account and raw results of the test taker. 

Should the test taker no longer want to allow the purchasing individual or group to have access their account, the test taker may reimburse the purchasing individual or group the full amount of the purchase price and return sole access of that account to test taker only. Once the test taker has provided documentation to Family Tree DNA that they have provided a full reimbursement of the purchase to the original payor, we will be able to return access to test taker alone. Please note that although a test taker may reclaim ownership of the record and DNA stored with Family Tree DNA, they cannot undo any prior data downloads or sharing outside of Family Tree DNA. 

The owner of an account is responsible for naming a beneficiary to that account, should the test taker pass away. If no beneficiary is named on the account, Family Tree DNA retains ownership of the record and DNA. 

Family Tree DNA provides the option to participate in one or more projects. This may help you learn more by working with others who may share similar ancestry. If you choose to participate in a project, the project administrator will be able to view your results and contact information so that he or she may best help members of the project learn about their ancestry. 

[You can view a list of projects here](https://web.archive.org/projects.aspx). 

While FTDNA has strict project administrator guidelines that requires administrators to abide by our [Group Administrator Guidelines for FTDNA Projects](https://www.familytreedna.com/learn/project-administration/gap-guidelines-ftdna-projects/), Family Tree DNA is not responsible for anything that the individual administrator does that is against those guidelines, other than admonishing or removing a group administrator from his or her role, if he or she is found to have breached or infringed on those guidelines. 

Projects often have a public website displaying member results, so that members can share information more easily. Most groups will also have a member list that is available to members of the project, and includes name, email address, and haplogroups. You may opt out of this list by choosing the appropriate setting in your Privacy Settings. The free website that Family Tree DNA provides to projects may list member results by kit number. Results tables and maps on the free public website may include a participant’s oldest known ancestor, the ancestor’s country of origin, surname, and full name. Note that any changes you make to your permissions or privacy settings can experience a delay when updating on such public pages. You may wish to discuss what information will be available on the project’s website before joining a project. 

You may join or leave projects at any time at no charge. Please note that any information or data downloaded by a group administrator for analysis cannot be retrieved and the project administrator may still have access to your downloaded results even after you have left a project. 

It is important to note that while Family Tree DNA does not impose a limit to the number of projects one can join, we will not tolerate customers joining multiple projects with the purpose of data mining or finding information that is not relevant to one's personal ancestral origins. Family Tree DNA reserves the right to remove people from projects at our sole discretion or if it feels that a participant is abusing the system in a way that may infringe another participant's privacy. 

The mtDNA full sequence test contains some genes in the coding region (CR). By default, these results are unavailable to the project administrators. You may choose to allow your project administrators to view your coding region results on the My Account – Results Display Settings page of your myFTDNA Account (personal page). 

A "Relevant Match" as stated in the [release form](https://web.archive.org/forms/FTDNA-release-form.pdf) is one of the following: 

You retain ownership in Personal Information and content such as photos, videos, posts, and comments submitted by you (collectively, “User Submitted Content”) to Family Tree DNA and its websites. You hereby grant Family Tree DNA a world-wide, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual license to host, display, sub-license, distribute, recreate, modify, or use such User Submitted Content in any form, to any extent, or within any context Family Tree DNA deems necessary to promote, modify, or develop its services. This license continues even if you stop using Family Tree DNA’s services. 

Family Tree DNA maintains the right, in its sole discretion, to remove, edit, block, or refuse any User Submitted Content and disable access thereto for any reason, including without limitation that such User Generated Content violates the Terms of Service or is otherwise objectionable. 

All User Submitted Content provided to Family Tree DNA and its websites is the sole responsibility of the person who submitted it. This means that you are entirely responsible for all User Submitted Content that you provide.

## Non-Personal Information

When you visit our Gene by Gene website, we may automatically collect non-personal information about you, such as the website from which you have come to our Gene by Gene Website, your Media Access Control address, your computer type, screen resolution, Operating System version and Internet browser. We may also collect non-personal information such as demographic data, for example your geographic area. Non-personal information also includes personal information that has been aggregated in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Gene by Gene Website. 

## Additional Consent 

Your use of any of Gene by Gene's services constitutes your consent to Gene by Gene allowing us to use your Personal Information for purposes of quality control and internal research and development activities. 

Additionally, your consent will be sought for research purposes. Much of the genetic information resulting from DNA testing has not been clinically validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. For these reasons, our customers are encouraged to participate in Gene by Gene's research initiatives that may contribute to a better understanding of the results of genetic testing. Your participation in these initiatives is entirely voluntary and your DNA test results will not be used or disclosed without your consent. Once given, however, consent cannot be revoked. 

We will ask for your consent in several ways. For example: 

  1. A general consent document will be offered to you as part of your decision to participate in any of the Gene by Gene services offered by any of the websites owned and operated by Gene by Gene. Your consent will allow Gene By Gene to share your test results, anonymized and aggregated with those of others who have consented, with our third-party research partners for the purposes of general scientific research intended to lead to publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
  2. From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research, and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of general scientific research intended to lead to publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. 
  3. From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to participate in specific research, and upon this consent we may allow our research partners to access your individual test results, which will be kept anonymous, for the purposes of scientific research aimed at advancing genetic knowledge and creating, commercializing, or undertaking activities toward the practical applications that may lead to the improvement of health care.
  4. From time to time, we may ask for explicit consent to allow our research partners to access your non-anonymized individual test results in connection with a specific research project.



Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support population genetic studies, scientific/medical research, or the development of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.
