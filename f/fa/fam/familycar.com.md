**Privacy Policy**

Last updated 6-14-2005

We are committed to protecting your privacy. You can access and browse most pages on Familycar.com without disclosing any information about yourself, but sometimes we need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains our data collection and how we use it in those instances.

**Collection of Personal Information:** We will ask you when we need information that identifies you or allows us to contact you. Typically we request this information when you register for our online Forums, submit a form or questionnaire, sign up for our mailing list or sign up for a lesson or event. For example, if you contact us with a question or a problem with your car, we will request information; such as: name, email address and pertinent vehicle information.

We monitor the number of visitors to our sites and general traffic statistics, including how many visitors view certain pages or click on specific links, but our statistic servers do not link your visits to our site with your personal information. We collect only the personal information that you voluntarily provide. 

**Use and Disclosure of Information:** We do not sell or rent individual personal information. We typically use your personal information for the following purposes: 

To deliver services, such as specific vehicle recommendations that you request or products that you purchase. To alert you to new articles and reviews, news and updated information.  If you decline to receive this mail or email, we allow you to opt out (see “Control of Information.”) 

To give you access to limited-entry areas of our site, as appropriate. We will disclose your information only where it is necessary to do the following: 

  * Enable third parties to perform specific tasks for us. When we use outside companies to perform services on our behalf, like processing orders, shipping merchandise, mailing fliers, etc., we provide those companies with the information required to perform the task and we prohibit them from using the information for any other purpose. 

  * Meet legal requirements when there is a good-faith belief that such action is required by law; or to protect the safety of employees or members of the public. 




**Control of Information:** When you give us personal information, we will not share it with third parties without your permission, except under the circumstances stated above. 

If you have questions about the accuracy of your personal information or if you wish to remove yourself from our email list, please contact us using the information at the bottom of this page.

**Security of Information:** We are committed to protecting your personal information. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it by using encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  We do not keep your credit card information in our database.  You will have to reenter it every time you make a purchase.

**Protection of Children's Personal Information:** We do not knowingly collect personal information from children through our web pages.

**With respect to Ad Servers:** To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of: [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) or the privacy policies on the web sites that the links take you to.

**Use of Cookies:** If we use "cookies", it is only as session variables to provide a better experience as users move from page to page.  The “cookies” we use are temporary and are removed from memory when the user leaves the browser. 

**Revisions to this Statement** We reserve the right to change this privacy statement without notice to individuals. When we do, we will revise the effective date at the top and, if appropriate, place a notice on our Home Page.
