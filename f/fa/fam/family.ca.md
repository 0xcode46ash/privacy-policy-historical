**_If you are under the Age of Majority (Especially all Children under the Age of 13)_**   
Family contests are open to people under the age of majority but Family requires declarations and releases to be signed by a parent or guardian of any winner who is under the age of majority prior to the awarding/release of a prize. No Information collected from entrants under the age of majority may be used for any direct marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever.

**_Banner Advertisements and Links to other sites_**   
Banner advertisements or other interactive advertisements may appear on the Site. An interactive advertisement is one that involves you in some active way. Banner advertisements are ads that look like a banner or a box and usually appear at the top of the screen. If you click on one of these advertisements you may be taken to another site and this Privacy Policy will no longer apply. 

Family may use a third party service provider to serve the banner advertisements to the Site. If so, a temporary "cookie" may be used in serving the advertisement to ensure that you do not see the same ad more than once per visit. A "cookie" is an electronic file that contains information created about your visit to the website that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie would be only temporary, which means that it would last for the time you are online and then disappear. 

Our e-mail newsletter may also contain advertisements for third parties. We are not responsible for the content of any of these third party advertisements. 

For the purposes of linking to fan clubs, downloading plug-ins and other browser enhancements that may be necessary for the enjoyment and use of parts of our Site, links may be used from time to time. 

Visitors should be aware that when they are on our Site and a link is available, these third party sites are beyond our control. Links to other sites take visitors outside Family's service. This includes links to affiliates, potential advertisers, sponsors and partners that may enter into agreements with Family. As noted above, third party sites may use cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up and who you are dealing with. To check if you are still on our Site, look at the URL indicator at the top of your screen. The URL indicator contains the domain name or address of the website you are visiting. If the top of the screen does not show "family.ca", you may not be on our Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party sites. 

**_Security_**   
We know how important privacy is to you. That is why we protect and safeguard your Personal Information in a reasonably secure environment, keeping it physically separate and on a separate server where possible. Only those employees with a need to use your Personal Information are given access to it. And all of these employees are bound by the terms of their employment contracts to maintain the confidentiality of that information. We also ensure that such employees are trained to respect your privacy at all times. 

**_Accessing Your Personal Information_**

We will make appropriate efforts to verify your identity prior to providing you with access to your personal information.
