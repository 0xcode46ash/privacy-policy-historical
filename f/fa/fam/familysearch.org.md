# Privacy Policy

| 

We are very sensitive to concerns about the use and security of personal information provided through FamilySearch Internet. This policy provides answers to some of the frequently asked questions concerning privacy issues.

#### What information will be collected? How will it be used?

  * Users must provide some personal information to us when they register. Users must register before they can submit a GEDCOM file, subscribe to collaboration lists, or suggest that a site be added to FamilySearch Internet. This information helps us ensure that users are abiding by the [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/policy/FSI_terms.asp).  

  * Personal information may be included in GEDCOM files submitted to FamilySearch Internet and made publicly available. Submitters are instructed that they must get permission from every living individual included in their GEDCOM file before submitting their information to FamilySearch Internet. Any information contained in GEDCOM file submissions may be made available publicly. For additional information about how information included in GEDCOM submissions may be used, please see [Conditions for Submitting Your Genealogy](https://web.archive.org/policy/FSI_preserve.asp).  

  * Information that is voluntarily disclosed on collaboration lists will be distributed to others on that collaboration list. We do not collect or store personal information included in collaboration messages. For additional information about how information included in collaboration lists may be used, please see [Conditions for Joining a Mailing List](https://web.archive.org/policy/FSI_collaboration.asp).  

  * When users request pages from FamilySearch Internet, our servers may log their IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever users surf the web. It is different than a domain name. This information may be used to improve site administration.  

  * The personal information that is collected, as described above, also may be used to produce usage statistics. These statistics help us better meet the needs of our users by providing information about research interests. We may also use this information to inform users about products, services, activities, and other subjects that may be of interest.  

  * We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18. They are advised to get permission from their parents before they send any information about themselves or others.  




#### **How do we protect customer information?**

FamilySearch Internet has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. However, because no security measures are foolproof, we cannot guarantee that information will not be lost or misused.

#### **Please check the Privacy Policy each time you access the site for changes. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Privacy Policy at any time.**
