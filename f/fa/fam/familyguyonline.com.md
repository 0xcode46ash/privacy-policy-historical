**1\. INTRODUCTION**  


Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising, a division of Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., as Administrator for Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (“Family Guy Online,” “we”, “us,” “our”) operates the website located at www.familyguyonline.com and all corresponding web pages and websites associated with the foregoing URL (“Site”), and any content, applications, features, functionality and other information and services offered from time to time in connection with the Site, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the “Services"). The Services are part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.  


As set forth in our[ Terms of Use](http://www.familyguyonline.com/terms_of_use) , the Site is a general audience site which is not targeted to children and use of the Services is limited to users aged 13 years and above.

This Policy describes our collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address), where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services. It also describes generally our practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all “users,” including both those who use some of the Services without being registered with the Services and those who have registered with the Services.

**2\. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE SERVICES** __

_User Submitted Information_

**Registration Information** is the information that users must provide to us at registration for the Services, for example, in order to create an account, receive a newsletter, take a survey or enter contest or sweepstake. Registration Information includes information such as account name, one or multiple avatars, email address, and date of birth.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of your account name, avatar(s) and your game activity, for example your game status and in-game items and your posts and comments on the Services, for example, in forums or blogs. Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines.

**User-to-User Communications**

may be possible through the Services, such as messages or chats.

  
_Information Collected by the Services_

**Site Activity Information.** When users access the Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect transactional information such as a unique device identifier assigned to that device, your geolocation, or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.

Third parties that support the Services by, for example, serving advertisements or providing services, such as, allowing users to communicate, share content, make purchases, or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info.](http://www.aboutads.info/)

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies including cookies with the Flash management tools available at [Adobe’s website](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/%20faq.htm) . Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Services.

**Third Parties.**

To improve the quality of the Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties. If you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your user ID and/or user name associated with that third-party service, or any information you have made public in connection with that service or which the third party shares with its partner services.
