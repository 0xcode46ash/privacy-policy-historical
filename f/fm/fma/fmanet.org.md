This Web site is published and maintained by Fabricators & Manufacturers Association, International (FMA), with offices located at 833 Featherstone Road, Rockford, IL 61107. 

**Purpose**  
This privacy statement explains what information is collected on fmanet.org, a FMA Web site, how the information is used, and who has access to it. 

**Children**  
If you are younger than 13 you must get permission from your Mother or Father or legal guardian before you enter your name or any information about yourself on this Web site. Do not enter your name, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that might help identify you or your family or where you live whether in response to a form, in a chat room or on a bulletin board. 

**What Information is Collected?**  
FMA does not collect any personally identifying information such as name, address or e-mail address without the knowledge and consent of the individual concerned. Such information is collected by voluntary means only through the e-mail newsletter subscription form, E-commerce portion of the site, online databases, buyers guides, online publication subscription forms, job boards, and surveys that appear from time to time on fmanet.org. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to a visitor's computer hard drive in order to mark a visitor and track his or her use of the Web site. Cookies are an industry standard. They may be used by fmanet.org, and are used by many other major Web sites. 

A cookie itself does not gather any personally identifying information. They track where you travel on fmanet.org and what you look at. In doing so, a cookie may enable FMA to relate your use of the Web site to personally identifying information that has already been submitted. Cookies allow us to improve our service to you by giving us information about your use of fmanet.org so that we can provide the content and services you seek. 

Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will not interfere with your use of fmanet.org. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies. 

**How is the information used?**  
Information collected by fmanet.org cookies may be used by FMA to improve our site. We may also use this information to target advertisements or other content on the site to products or services that may be of interest to you. In some cases, we may share this information with other interested parties from whom we think you might want to receive information. 

Cookies may also be used by FMA's Web advertising technology software, WebAdverts. The non-personally identifiable information collected by WebAdverts is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of fmanet.org's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. 

**Chat Rooms & Bulletin Boards **  
If you provide information to a chat room, bulletin board, or advertiser you should be aware that your information may then be made available to others. 

**Right to Opt Out**  
At any time that FMA collects personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity to "opt out" of any use or disclosure of it. 

**Use of Aggregated Information**  
FMA reserves the right to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of the fmanet.org. FMA may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user. 

**E-mail**  
If you contact FMA by e-mail, you should be aware that e-mail transmissions might not be secure. Information you send by e-mail could be viewed in transit by a third party. FMA will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during transmission. 

**FMA's Right to Change this Policy**  
FMA reserves the right to change or update this Policy, or any policies or practices, at any time without notice to any users of fmanet.org. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Web sites.
