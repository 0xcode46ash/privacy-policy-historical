We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post a notice of such change in the modified version of the Privacy Policy. Such modified Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. It is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. Your continued use of, and/or participation on the Website after we post a revised version of this Privacy Policy, signifies your acceptance of the revised terms of such policy. By visiting our Website, you agree that your visit and any dispute regarding our privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy.

##### **2\. Types of Information We Collect From You.**

We may collect information that individually identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include but is not limited to: your name; physical address; phone number; e-mail address; or any combination of information that individually identifies you.

We may also collect information that does not individually identify you (“Other Information”). Other Information may include but is not limited to: any combination of information that does not individually identify you; statistical and aggregated data on the specific pages you access or visit; or any information that is not otherwise defined as Personal Information.

##### **3\. Collection of Your Personal Information and Other Information**

_Information Provided Directly to Us._  
We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Website through the information you share with us. However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Website without directly providing us with any information about you; but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Website. In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Website, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.  
The Website provides certain activities in which we gather Personal Information from users of the Website, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process. Registration to participate in these Website activities may require the submission of your name, email address and other Personal Information (as may be applicable). Other Information and Personal Information that may be submitted include the industry you work in, communication preferences, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Website feature or service. If you choose to sign up to receive any of our services, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. In addition, you may have the ability to opt in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Website) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information.  
We may collect Personal Information and Other Information from the testimonials or posts you may provide. If you submit any testimonials to be posted on our Website, we will obtain your consent prior to using your name and testimonial.

_Information Collected Automatically._  
In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our Website also automatically collects Personal Information and/or Other Information about you that may include information related to your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites and/or applications you visited before and after visiting our Website; web pages and advertisements you view; links you click on our Website; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law (provided that if we choose to implement such functionality, we will obtain your consent on your first use of the service); information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed; information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.

_Information Obtained from Other Sources._  
Where permitted by applicable law, we may also obtain Other Information (e.g. demographic information, interests, purchases, etc.) and/or Personal Information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, from sites/applications (for example, on our pages on Facebook), and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).  
Combining Information.

Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, to help us tailor our communications to you, and to develop rich online content and services across the Website.

_Wireless Device Information._  
Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes, contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “wireless.bellsouth.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest/sweepstakes or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.

##### **4\. Cookies and Similar Technologies**

You should be aware that Other Information and data may be automatically collected on the Website through the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. While the data collected through the use of such technologies does not contain Personal Information, once you choose to furnish our Website with Personal Information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie and such information may be used to personalize your experience with our Website (for example, recognizing you by name when you return to the Website), saving your password in password protected areas, or enabling you to use shopping carts on our Website. Web beacons and cookies may also be used to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior. We may also use such technologies to help us offer you more relevant information or products and services of interest to you. Cookies also identify you to our servers allowing you the opportunity to avoid reentering your email and password each time you access the Website.

Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Website. For more information regarding this use, please see our “Links to Third Party Sites and/or Applications” section below.

We may also use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.

You can also engage with our content, such as videos, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins, and/or applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo(s), gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the “likes” you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application or plug-in. We may also obtain Other Information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information regarding advertisements within the content you have been shown and may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content.  
When you provide Personal Information and/or Other Information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Website, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.

Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your Personal Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

##### **6\. Our Use of Your Information**

We use your Personal Information and Other Information, to provide you with features, services or goods, or information you request, to respond to your questions or comments related to us or the Website, and to enable you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, contests/sweepstakes, activities, and message boards.

##### **7\. Our Disclosure of Your Information**

We may share information, including your Personal Information and Other Information, with our affiliates, service providers and advertisers. We may also disclose your Personal Information in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law. We may transfer Personal Information and Other Information about you if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with another company.

Our agents and contractors who have access to your Personal Information and Other Information are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf. However, with your consent, we may disclose your Personal Information and Other Information to third parties who are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., marketers, retailers, non-profit organizations, participatory databases) that want to market products or services to you.

When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help administer the promotion, including in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment. Your Personal Information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list. Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law.

We and our Website continue to expand our online presence in order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences. We may share information we collect about you through our Website so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.

We may share aggregated or anonymized data with third parties. This information cannot be used to individually identify you. Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Website, and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated data does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated data and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.

If you have signed up to receive our emails and prefer not to receive marketing information from our Website, follow the unsubscribe instructions provided on any such email you receive from our Website.

This Privacy Policy addresses only our use of information we collect from you online. Accordingly, information you disclose on message boards, in chat rooms and forums, through content you provide or in any other way can be viewed, collected and/or used by others and we are not responsible for information you disclose in this manner.

##### 8\. Links to Third Party Sites and/or Applications

We may sometimes offer content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. The Website also may contain links to the sites and/or applications of third parties not affiliated with us, such as advertisers. If you click on an advertiser’s advertisement, you will link to the advertiser’s site and/or application.

Once you leave our Website via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties, advertiser site, or application to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you. You understand, acknowledge and agree that these links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us. We are NOT responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other sites or applications, including any sites or applications that may indicate a special relationship or “partnership” with us. If you decide to access any of the third-party sites or applications linked to the Website, you do so entirely at your own risk.

You may also update or amend your information by sending an email to [privacy@hyfnlocal.com](mailto:privacy@hyfnlocal.com). We will provide you with a list of your Personal Information within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of your request. There may be certain instances in which we may not be able to provide the Personal Information, such as when access would violate the privacy of another individual or when access is prohibited by law.

##### **11\. Your California Privacy Rights**

California law allows California residents, once a year and free of charge, to request information about certain types of Personal Information (if any) that a business has disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year. However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right. If you are a California resident and you would like to prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to participate in these activities. If you are a California resident, and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to discontinue our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please notify HYFN to discontinue such disclosure, by e-mail to [privacy@hyfnlocal.com](mailto:privacy@hyfnlocal.com) or at the following address:

Privacy Administrator

701 Brazos, Ste. 800  
Austin, TX 78701

Additionally, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Website where this Privacy Policy is posted, you may request and potentially obtain removal of content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [privacy@hyfnlocal.com](mailto:privacy@hyfnlocal.com). All requests must provide: (a) a detailed description of the specific content or Personal Information you want removed; (b) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the content or Personal Information, including but not limited to the name and URL (if applicable) of the Website where such information is located; and (c) your registered username and contact information reasonably sufficient to contact you if we have questions. We shall not accept requests via postal mail, telephone, or facsimile. We are not responsible for requests that are not properly sent, and may not be able to respond or take appropriate action if you do not provide complete information. Please also note that requests for removal do not ensure removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow for removal even if requested.

##### **12\. Security of Information**

We take reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information. Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information that you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.  
We do not and will not ever request your login information, password or credit card information in an unsecured or unsolicited email or telephone communication. This practice is commonly known as “phishing.” For more information about “phishing” and protecting your Personal Information from identity theft, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission at [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/).

##### **13\. Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy**

Our Website is intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect or store Personal Information about children under the age of 13. We may ask for a birth date to ensure that we are not collecting Personal Information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with Personal Information collected from children under 18. In those instances where we have actual knowledge that we are collecting Personal Information from children or the Website offers a service directed toward children, we will comply with applicable laws.

##### **14\. Applicable Law**

We control and operate our Website from the United States. The Website is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Please note that we do not represent or warrant that the Website is appropriate for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Website do so at their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Further, by using and participating in our Website or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, access and processing of your information in and/or outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

##### **15\. Updates**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 16, 2017. Because Internet technologies are rapidly changing, we reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time, in our sole discretion. All changes will be promptly posted on this page, with an updated “effective date.” Your continued viewing, browsing, use or access of the Website following our posting of an updated Privacy Policy will constitute your binding acceptance of those changes.
