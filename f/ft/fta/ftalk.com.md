## Privacy Policy

("fTalk") takes your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about fTalk's Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how fTalk receives, collects and uses information in connection with their website located at ftalk.com and software provided on the ftalk.com website (the website and software collectively referred to herein as "Site").

**Collection and Use of Information**

fTalk does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information, such as names, e-mail, age, gender, address, telephone numbers, login names and passwords or other self-identifying information ("Personal Information"). fTalk may request that a user provide an e-mail address if such user wishes to be contacted regarding any offers, updates, newsletters and service related announcements. If a user provides an e-mail address to fTalk, such user authorizes fTalk to send user communications.

fTalk may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at fTalk's Site. Cookies may be used to analyze Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. fTalk's use of cookies is in no way linked to any Personal Information.

fTalk may automatically receive and record certain non-personally identifiable information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), cookie information, and the webpage that a user visits. fTalk collects non-personally identifiable information for general purposes, including but not limited to analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting to internal and external clients. fTalk will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of its users.

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information**

fTalk does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. fTalk may disclose your Personal Information if fTalk believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on fTalk; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of fTalk (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of fTalk services or members of the public.

**Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13. Visitors younger than 13 years of age may NOT use the fTalk website and software and must LEAVE immediately.

**Security**

fTalk takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although fTalk cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, fTalk has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

**Business Transitions**

In the event that fTalk goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. fTalk will post a notice on this website of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information fTalk may have prior to such transfer.

**Changes to Policy**

From time to time, fTalk may revise this Policy. fTalk will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information fTalk collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.
