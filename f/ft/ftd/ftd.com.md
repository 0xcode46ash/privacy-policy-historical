# FTD.COM - Security & Privacy

Effective July 30, 2004

Your Security & Privacy Are Important to Us

When shopping at FTD.COM, safe transactions and the protection of your privacy are our number-one priorities. To help our customers understand our commitment to security and privacy, we've outlined our policy in detail. 

Ordering from FTD.COM is easy, convenient, and very safe. All private information that you send us (including credit card numbers, names, addresses, and telephone numbers) is encrypted so that your private information cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet.

FTD.COM uses Verisign, a leading provider of Internet protection services, including digital certification, to secure every transaction. We also use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than us. 

If you choose to open an FTD.COM Personal Account with us, your password will be your personal, secret entry code to FTD.COM. Your password is needed to access any account areas. Your password keeps your account information private and secure. You can change your password as many times as you like.

**Placing an Order**  
When you place an order, we require you to provide us with personal contact and billing information, including your address and telephone number. We use this information to give you a customized experience and to process the orders that you place with us. 

When you place an order, your account information is saved only if you ask us to save it. When you do, our database stores your billing and delivery information, and automatically transfers it to the order form each time you place an order so that you do not have to re-enter this information. If you open an account with us, you have access to an address book that includes addresses and other contact information about persons to whom you wish to send flowers or gifts. You can view or edit information in your address book at anytime. 

The recipient phone number is used for delivery purposes. On some occasions, the recipient may be called to schedule delivery. To maintain our high quality standards, we will occasionally contact the recipient to ensure the satisfaction with their gift. 

**Sweepstakes & Contests**  
When you participate in sweepstakes, contests, and promotions sponsored by FTD.COM, we use the personal information provided to qualify your entry and to contact you, should you come up a winner. 

**Interactive Tools**  
At the time of registering, you also have the option to opt in for our additional services, which include a personal date reminder service, a free online address book, and frequent buyer program points. We use your contact information so that you may take full advantage of these interactive tools. We give you the option to opt out of these additional services at anytime. 

**General Information**  
When you visit FTD.COM, we collect some basic non-identifying information. This specifically includes information regarding your operating system, browser software, and IP (Internet Protocol) address. This information is collected in order to provide you with satisfactory service. We may use the information to detect problems with our server and to administer our Web site.
