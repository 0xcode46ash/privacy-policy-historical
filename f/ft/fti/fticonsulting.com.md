# Privacy Policy

FTI Consulting is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of information entrusted to it, including any personal information (sometimes referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “PII”) collected through its websites. Your continued use of this website constitutes your agreement with this Privacy Policy and any subsequent updates.  Please see the additional information under the heading [[Legal](https://web.archive.org/about/legal)] for more information about our on-line terms of use and policies in general.

**Purpose for Collecting Personal Information**

On certain areas of its websites, FTI Consulting allows you to provide personal information so that we may fulfill your requests for information or otherwise allow you to interact with us.  For instance, personal information may be used to fulfill your requests for FTI Consulting publications, to allow you to publish comments on our website content, or to facilitate our receipt and processing of your career-related inquiries.

**What types of personal information is collected?**

The personally identifiable information that may be collected might include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Additional background information might be collected in connection with career-related inquiries.

In addition, FTI Consulting may collect certain types of information that you do not visibly enter, such as your IP address, browsing patterns on our websites, click stream data, and HTP protocol elements.  This tracking information is stored in anonymous, aggregated and non-personal format, and is used to understand and analyze trends, to administer the websites, and to learn about user behavior on the websites.  However, FTI Consulting may use IP addresses to help identify you when FTI Consulting feels, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy, to protect its services, websites, systems, information, employees, business partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, users, customers or others, or when required by law or for law enforcement purposes.

**Use of Cookies**

FTI Consulting may use cookies on our websites to improve performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains generally how cookies work.

(a) **What are Cookies?**

The information your browser sends to one of our websites is used for authentication and identification of your session and allows us to display the correct information on the website.
