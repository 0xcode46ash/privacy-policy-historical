The Fodors.com Web site (the "Site") is operated by Fodors LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of [Random House Inc.](http://www.bertelsmann.com/divisions/random_house/facts/facts.cfm), located at 1745 Broadway, New York, New York 10019 ("Fodors"). We can be reached by e-mail at [registration@fodors.com](mailto:registration@fodors.com). 

**HOW FODOR'S USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:** This Site does not collect personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Fodors.com only collects personal information from our online visitors during (1) contests and sweepstakes; (2) registration for specific activities (for example, bulletin boards or e-mail newsletters) or membership on our Site; (3) marketing surveys; and/or (4) during customer support or technical service requests. We do not require personal information to gain access to the Site, however you will not be able to access areas that require registration without disclosing personally identifiable information. 

Information collected may include your name, address, phone number, and email address. 

A user's personally identifying information will not be sold or rented to any other party without prior consent. 

Fodors.com provides its users the opportunity to receive promotional information from it, its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as third party vendors. Such vendors include businesses offering special travel services and discounts. In such instances, Fodors will always provide an opt-in function when users submit personally identifiable information for such site activities as bulletin boards, newsletters, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, etc. You will not receive unsolicited emails from us or from third parties unless you specifically give us permission to do so via the opt-in function. You can tell us not to share this information at any time by clicking [here](mailto:registration@fodors.com). 

In addition to the uses described above, a user's personally identifying information may be used by Fodor's, its parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates for editorial or quality control purposes. Fodors.com may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on Fodors.com or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Fodors.com, the Site or the users of Fodors.com, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety or users of Fodors.com, the Site or the public. 

If we desire to use your information for purposes not disclosed, we will announce such a plan and ask you to "opt in." If you wanted to share your personal information, you would have to respond. In the absence of such a response, your information would not be disclosed for the new purpose. 

If you have any concerns about the above, feel free to e-mail us at [editors@fodors.com](mailto:registration@fodors.com). In the subject line of your e-mail, please type the phrase "PRIVACY POLICY." 

Fodors.com users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (such as an e-mail address) within the body of a post on the bulletin boards, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we collect anonymous aggregated Site usage data on Fodors.com for statistical purposes, and we often provide it to third parties as a measure of the popularity of our Site. 

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

**HYPERLINKS:** This Site, including the Fodors.com newsletter, contains hyperlinks to other sites. These hyperlinks include links from advertisers, vendors of products and services referenced on the Site, and other third parties. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, or a promotion by a third party, or to purchase software products from a third-party vendor, the "click" takes you off the Site. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. 

**ADVERTISING:** The ads appearing on this Site are delivered to you by 24/7 Real Media, the ad network utilized by our advertising sales force, Interep, or comparable service providers.

**COOKIES:** Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Fodors.com places cookies in the browser files of a Fodors.com user's computer, and these cookies either enable certain site functions, such as the bulletin boards, or allow for the anonymous aggregation of user activity on the Fodors.com Site for statistical purposes.

Any personally identifying information associated with such cookies will be subject to the provisions outlined above. Fodors.com publishes advertiser banners and badges containing links to advertiser Web sites, engages in e-commerce affiliate programs with companies such as Expedia, directs users seeking to purchase software products to third-party vendors, and provides hyperlinks to other Web sites for editorial purposes. If you view these banners and badges, or link to any of these sites, you also may get cookies from them. Fodors.com does not control these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of any Web site that issues you a cookie. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
