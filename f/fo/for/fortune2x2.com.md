Privacy is a primary concern today, on and off the Internet. We are aware of these concerns and want you to feel comfortable using our site.  
  
Fortune2x2 believes that your personal information -- including your purchases, email, residential addresses, and credit card data -- belongs to you, and we are committed to your Data Protection. We collect this type of information when you provide it to us, but we do not rent or sell information concerning our customers to third parties. We may partner with other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting, but we will never share your personal information with these organizations unless you give us permission to do so.  
  
What Do We Use The Information Collected For?  
  
During your visit to Fortune2x2 we collect the following information for these purposes:  
  
• Your e-mail address and password that provide access to special areas of our web site where you can streamline your shopping experience.   
  
• Your shipping and billing address for order processing.   
  
• Your phone number so we can contact you concerning any problems with your order.   
  
• Your e-mail address for order confirmation and updates for any new information from Fortune2x2.  
   You may opt out of our updates at any time as we operate a strict unsubscribe policy.   
  
What about cookies?  
  
Fortune2x2 uses a technology called "cookies" to remember you and the information you are saving, such as your shipping address (credit card and payment information is not stored in this way). When you visit Fortune2x2, we send you back a cookie, a small text file that includes a temporary inquiry number, your IP address, plus any items you've chosen. Your web browser has a special folder on your computer where it keeps cookies. Cookies cannot harm your computer in any way. Only the website that places a cookie on your computer can read it and no other website may access the cookie Fortune2x2 places on your computer.  Should you wish to do so, you can delete cookies at anytime from within your browser software.  
  
What Security measures do you take regarding my Payment Data?   
  
Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor your privacy. Fortune2x2 utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you place an order with Fortune2x2 your credit card information is captured and stored separately from your order, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than our customer service staff.
