# Foreclosures.com - The Foreclosure Experts

  
**Your privacy on the Internet is as important to us as it is to you.**  
We acquire information about our users for many purposes.  
Below is a description of the types of information we gather and its use.

  * **_Email Addresses_**  
ForeclosureS.com will never disclose, share or sell your information to any outside company for any purpose. Email Addresses that you provide to us are used to fulfill your order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer service possible. If you do not wish to receive our informative monthly newsletter the [Foreclosure Forecast](https://web.archive.org/www/forecast/) (see Subscription Forms below), or other similar free services and information, please follow the link at the bottom of any such email we send you to unsubscribe or update your contact preferences. 
  * **_Subscription Forms_**  
Our online newsletter, **The Foreclosure Forecast** , gives users the option of subscribing. This is a free service and the only information we require from our subscribers is their name, e-mail address, and Zip code. This is a voluntary subscription and can be cancelled at any time by following the instructions provided within each issue. 
  * **_Ordering Products & Services_**  
ForeclosureS.com order forms require a **customer's name, address, phone number, e-mail, and credit card information**. Once this information is collected, it is used only for the purpose of processing (and technical support if applicable) for this order. Our order forms all reside on a secure server with 128 bit encryption. If a user does not feel comfortable with this method of payment, **we also accept orders via phone, fax, and US Mail**. [[How to contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011090709id_/http%3A//www.foreclosures.com/www/pages/contact_information.asp)] 
  * **_Usage Tracking_**  
ForeclosureS.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout our site. We do not, however, correlate this information with data about individual users.  
Search terms are stored and used to better structure our site so that users can find the information they search for more easily. The tracking of search terms is never associated with individual users. We create reports on user traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because ForeclosureS.com doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.
  *  ** _Cookies_**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. ForeclosureS.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above), and also to "remember" information such as content you've already read.  
**You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.** You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of the services at ForeclosureS.com. However, some of our exclusive services, such as **Foreclosure Listings** and **Coaching Message Boards** , may not function or display correctly without them. 
  * **_Premium Services_**  
ForeclosureS.com offers premium services, such as our **Foreclosure Listing Service**. When purchasing a subscription to this service, certain personal information is needed to process the order (as described above). Once the user's account is enabled, only a username and password are used to access the service. User logs are kept for use by our support technicians so that they may monitor system performance, and be alerted of account fraud or abuse.

  
_ForeclosureS.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. We do not share information about individual users with any third party. ForeclosureS.com does not control the practices of our advertisers._
