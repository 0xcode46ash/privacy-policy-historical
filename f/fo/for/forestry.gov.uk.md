# Forestry Commission - Privacy Policy

This page explains how we use any information you give to us through our website, and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

## The Data Protection Act

The Forestry Commission is a data controller under the Data Protection Act. Under the Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

## Cookies

### Introduction

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  

  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  

  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast



You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through  "[Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies)"

If you'd like to learn how to remove cookies set on your device, visit '[Our use of cookies](http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1)'
