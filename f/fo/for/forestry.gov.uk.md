# Forestry Commission - Privacy Policy

This page explains how we use any information you give to us through our website or Apps, and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

## Personal information charter

It also covers what we ask from you to help us keep your information up to date.

When we ask you for personal information, we promise to:

  * make sure you know why we need it

  * only share it with other organisations when the law allows
  * make sure we don’t keep it longer than necessary
  * not make your personal information available for commercial use without your permission.



In return, we ask you to:

  * give us accurate information
  * tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new address



This helps us to keep your information reliable and up to date.

You can get more details on:

  * how to find out what information we hold about you and how to ask us to correct any mistakes
