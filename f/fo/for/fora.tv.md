**ForaTv Privacy Policy**

Thank you for visiting ForaTv. Your privacy—and your trust--are important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. 

At the same time that _ForaTv_ is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you. In adopting this customer privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate interests in collecting and using information to enhance your ForaTv experience with your reasonable expectations of privacy. 

_ForaTv_ does not collect personally identifying information about individuals, except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. 

Web servers serving _ForaTv_ automatically collect information about which pages each user visits and the domain name of visitors. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We may provide information about our users, from time to time, on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our sponsors. 

_ForaTv_ may place a "cookie" on the browser of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we use the information for editorial purposes, so that we can customize delivery of information without compromising privacy. 

A user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside _ForaTv_.   
If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy for this site or its implementation you may contact though our [contact us form >>](https://web.archive.org/fora/sendmessage.php)

From time to time, we may update this privacy notice. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.
