For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server software automatically records the visitor's IP address in the server logs, and may set a Web cookie to identify that vistor uniquely. No personal information is stored in the cookie. Cookie data is used to grant access to subscriber-only content, maintain the list of items in the users "shopping cart", and for statistical purposes so that we may understand the way vistors use the site. 

From time to time, we permit certain carefully screened partner companies to send ground mail (not email!) to our subscribers. If you prefer not to receive ground mail from our partners, please contact us through Palm Coast Data:
