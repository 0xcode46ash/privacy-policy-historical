1.2.     Introduction
The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the Australian
Privacy Principles (APPs) and related rules require that HLK Group Pty Ltd (HLK), as an APP entity, establish
and maintain an APP Privacy Policy.
HLK is committed to respecting the privacy of personal information of our investors. This document is the
APP Privacy Policy adopted by the Board, as required by APP 1.3, and sets out the Company’s personal
information management practices. The aim of this APP Privacy Policy is to promote the protection of the
privacy of individuals and to promote responsible and transparent handling of personal information held.
The Privacy Act exempts employment records used for employment purposes and therefore these policies
do not apply to current or past employees of HLK. This employee records exemption does not apply to
unsuccessful job applicants, therefore they may be able to request for access to their personal information
held by HLK.
HLK Privacy Policy v 2                                                                             3 of 7
