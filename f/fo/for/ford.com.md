All information on our site is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide us with any information. Ford.com collects other information, non-personally identifiable information from site visitors. This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors. Non-personal information includes tracking the site pages that are visited or the amount of time spent on our site. Non-personal information also includes information about your browser/system for technical troubleshooting purposes.

Our primary goal in collecting aggregate information from you is to be able to perform site metrics that allow us to improve the functionality of the website. We need to collect aggregate information in order to track page visits, perform site click-through analysis, review peak site usage times and analyze site layout and design.

We use session and persistent "cookies," session logs, spot light ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags/banner ads or links to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors. We may also use third party advertising networks that serve ads to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors. An explanation for each of these items and how they work is included in the section on "Methods We Use to Collect Information."

### How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

### Methods We Use to Collect Information

A "cookie" is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. They allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.

A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.

A "persistent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.

Ford.com may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.

When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.

Users may be directed to ford.com via banner ads or site links. Ads or site links that are placed by ford.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal information from the user.
