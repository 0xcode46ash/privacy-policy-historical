# Online Form Builder - Privacy Statement

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to FormSite. FormSite attempts to minimize personal information account holders need to reveal. We strive to protect your data from unauthorized access. All security measures at the site are derived from the idea that the person who creates a form and solicits data for that form is the ultimate owner of the data. We will never give out any data collected from your form without your permission. Furthermore, we will not give out your name or any identifying information about specific users to any third party. Nor will we use any email address you provide for any third-party solicitations without your permission. Subject to court order, we will release any information as required by law.

**European Safe Harbors**  
FormSite complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. FormSite has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Policy of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.

FormSite may send you email messages on a regular basis to keep you apprised of your membership status and inform you of new services available to you. Included in each of these messages are simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these mailings if you do not wish to receive them in the future.

You can elect to terminate your membership with FormSite by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact.html). Be sure to include your Username in the body of your message, so that we can easily identify your account. Upon termination, your account information will not necessarily be removed entirely from FormSiteâ€”this is to reserve your identity so that no one else can create a new account with your Username or Email Address, and also allows you the privilege of reactivating your account at a later date if you wish to use FormSite again.

The systems containing the FormSite data are password protected and well administered. If our server is in some way compromised, the data may be revealed. Such an event is extremely unlikely.
