# Privacy Policy | ForeSee

ForeSee helps our clients identify the most meaningful improvements to their websites, stores, and service centers. These improvements let you enjoy a better experience each time you visit ForeSee's clients.

You may see two different ForeSee logos on surveys because we recently updated our logo. We are still the same company — still concerned about your privacy and security — and we still give our clients your valuable feedback, so they know how to better meet your needs. 

ForeSee Results, Inc. Privacy Statement Effective date: 11/4/2010

ForeSee Results is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors (at [www.foreseeresults.com](http://www.foreseeresults.com/)) as well as its offline visitors by maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality and security for all data collected from survey participants as well as visitors to our publicly available website.  This privacy notice describes how we collect information and how it is used.

## Categories of Individual Data Subjects

In general, ForeSee Results may obtain Personal data about several different types of individuals, including ****_(i) ForeSee Results’ own website Visitors, (ii) ForeSee Results clients, (iii) ForeSee Results clients’ consumers, and (iii) ForeSee Results clients’ website Visitors.   _ForeSee Results practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below. 

##  ForeSee Results' website Visitors

If you visit our website located at [www.foreseeresults.com](http://www.foreseeresults.com/), you may provide certain personal information about yourself if you choose to download information or contact us.  We use this information to respond to your inquiry and, if necessary, to correspond with you.  The types of information we collect on our site include name, email address, and mailing address. 

## Clients

ForeSee Results provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business clients ("Clients") including surveys (both online and offline) and clickstream data collection directed to individuals ("Data Subjects").  In some instances, ForeSee Results may obtain access to Personal Data about such Data Subjects in the course of providing the services and solutions.  In other instances, Foresee Results may also obtain access to Personal Data about our Clients' consumers and website visitors (collectively "End Users") in the course of providing support services to the Clients.  Such data may include email addresses and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.  


ForeSee Results may obtain various types of Personal Data about Data Subjects and End Users.  Such data typically includes anonymous demographic information such as age and gender, but may also include personal contact information in certain instances, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.  We do not collect any information from children under 13 year of age, and we require a parent or guardian’s permission to collect any information from a minor age 13-18.   


ForeSee Results may use these types of Personal Data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services to our Clients; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide customer feedback to our clients as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.  


Our Clients or End Users may contact us if any of their Personal Data changes, they wish to have inaccurate data deleted, or if they would like to access and correct Personal Data that we maintain about them.  They may contact us by sending an email to [privacypolicy@foreseeresults.com](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@foreseeresults.com), or by using the information at the end of this privacy statement.  Also, to the extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications from ForeSee Results, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications, they can contact us at [privacypolicy@foreseeresults.com](mailto:privacypolicy@foreseeresults.com).  We will respond to your request to access and/or correct your Personal Data within 30 days.   


Wherever we obtain access to Personal Data about Data Subjects who are End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.  If you are a an End User with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to Personal Data that we may maintain about you.  Moreover, if you would like to access and review your Personal Data, you should contact our Client with any such requests.  We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses.  


## Our Clients’ Customers and Website Visitors 

ForeSee Results collects customer satisfaction data on behalf of our clients from our Clients’ Web Users and other customers.  ForeSee Results collects this data through online and offline (in store) customer satisfaction surveys.  


ForeSee Results uses the information collected from the online and offline surveys to compile reports on customer satisfaction for our customers.  Due to the sensitive nature of research data, any information that is collected is treated with the utmost confidentiality.  The customer satisfaction data we collect from our Clients’ Web Users and other customers is shared only with the Client or as otherwise directed by the Client.  


## Other Necessary Disclosures

ForeSee Results will not sell any personal information gathered from individual respondents.  Furthermore, personal data is never shared with any third parties unless our Client has specifically authorized such.  All company-specific information (including receipt codes, etc) gathered through our online survey tool will be the property of the Client.  Our Clients are encouraged to participate in privacy initiatives to protect the privacy and security of the data collected.  However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of our Clients, we cannot be responsible for their actions.  We recommend that you always review the privacy policies of the website for which you have been presented a survey before you provide any personal information.   


ForeSee Results may disclose Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors as necessary in connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need.  ForeSee Results may also disclose Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business.  In these situations, ForeSee Results will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the Personal Data is appropriately protected.  ForeSee Results may also disclose Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where ForeSee Results believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.  


ForeSee Results’ surveys and website are not designed or intended to for use by children under 13, although the sites we survey may offer children’s products for purchase by adults.  If you are under 18, you should not participate in our survey or use our site without the permission and in the presence of a parent or guardian.  Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information for a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it immediately. Children over 13 should only provide us with personally identifiable information if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian.  


## Emails to Our Clients

If you are a current ForeSee Results Client, we will send you service-related emails on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.   
**Customer Service**  
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.  We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. We will occasionally send you information on products or services we think may be of interest to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.  You may opt-out from these types of communications by following the instructions included in each communication. 

## Cookies on our Site

Many websites use "cookies" to help personalize a respondent's online experience.  A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard drive of a computer by a web page server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services or websites you visit.  We use session level cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  A session level cookie expires when you close your browser.     


## Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our tracking utility company uses session level cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to track how many pages a particular visitor has passed over.   


## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.   


## Cookies In Our Surveys

Session level cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session.  ForeSee Results’ survey mechanism places a session level cookie on respondents' browser to track such non-personal information as:  how many pages a particular visitor has passed over; what page the visitor was viewing when the survey appeared; what language, browser and operating system a visitor is using; the referring website (i.e. Google); and any search terms that brought the visitor to the website.  We use this technique to gather the data described above, to ensure that a visitor has sufficiently browsed the site in order to adequately answer the survey, and to prevent an individual from getting a survey multiple times in a single session.  Persistent cookies are automatically deleted on a set expiration date.  We will only place a persistent cookie if the company employing ForeSee Results allows for this type of cookie to be utilized.  This persistent cookie will only be used to track that a particular respondent has seen the survey and has completed or denied the survey so as not to be bothered with it again within a reasonable amount of time.  In no way will ForeSee Results collect any personal information with this persistent cookie.  Nor will we track any visitor once they have left the given site.  


## Data Security and Integrity

ForeSee Results has global hosting centers that store and process Personal Data in various locations in the United States.  ForeSee Results takes reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Data in these centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  ForeSee Results also makes reasonable efforts to keep all Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete.  


While no system is completely foolproof, ForeSee Results takes security of the data collected very seriously.  We use secure server hosting locations with 24x7 security monitoring, firewall protection, controlled access, and encryption technology to protect your data.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  


If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at [privacypolicy@foreseeresults.com](mailto:privacypolicy@foreseeresults.com). ****  


## Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the ForeSee Results site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.  Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Foresee Results.  We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.  If you visit a third party website that is linked to a ForeSee Results site, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.  


## Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.  


## Aggregated Research Data

ForeSee Results compiles data collected from its online surveys to produce benchmark reports for its customers as well as media and other interested parties.  Such information is based on aggregated, anonymous information and does not include any personally identifiable information about individuals.
