# Forrester Research

Forrester respects your privacy. The ways we collect and use data from use of our Web site and certain other interactions with our clients are listed below: 

  1. Forrester may collect certain information when an individual (a) registers for use of this Site, (b) purchases certain products or services from us or (c) registers for one of our events.  We may also collect information from users seeking employment opportunities or when a user wishes to obtain more information about our products and services. 
  2. Forrester does not sell lists, accept advertising, or generate any third-party revenue from the data that is generated from this site.   
  3. Forrester may disclose certain data to third parties who perform services on our behalf and have a need to access the data in connection with those services.
  4. Forrester collects contact information of event attendees at the time of registration. An attendee’s name, job title, company and country of origin may be transferred to sponsors of the event and will be available during the event to attendees.
  5. Event attendees are provided with badges having barcodes that may be scanned at sponsored activities or sponsor booths.  Attendee contact information is transferred to any sponsor that scans the badge.  You should not let anyone scan a barcode unless you want that sponsor to have your contact information. 
  6. We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us. 
  7. Site administrators at client companies have access to usage data for their employees who are granted online access to Forrester's research, in order to manage access to that research. 
  8. Forrester regularly analyzes data pertaining to visitor trends, research consumption, and research grading in order to improve our research, plan site enhancements, and measure overall site effectiveness. We consider this data to be confidential information. 
  9. Forrester account managers, analysts, and other members of the research staff can place research documents into a client's Research Bookmarks. To prevent duplicate placement of research, research and account management employees can review the contents in this area. Internal employee education around our Privacy Policy includes discussion of Research Bookmarks review privileges and stresses the confidentiality of clients' data. 
  10. To encourage analysts to respond to client feedback, names and email addresses of clients that use the "Give Feedback" feature are forwarded to the analyst who wrote that report and to Forrester management. 
  11. You may receive periodic promotional emails and special offers from Forrester. You may unsubscribe to these emails at any time. 
  12. Forrester complies with the European Parliament and Council of the European Union directive regarding unsolicited email. For more information about legislation on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, see [The Directive for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy in the E-Communications Sector -2002/58/EC](http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=en&numdoc=32002L0058&model=guichett).
