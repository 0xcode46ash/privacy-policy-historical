Protecting the privacy and safeguarding the personal and financial information of our clients and website visitors is one of our highest priorities. The following Privacy Statement explains how GAIN Capital Group collects and protects your personal information. References to "GAIN Capital Group" in this Privacy Statement include all GAIN Capital Group companies and divisions, including FOREX.com.

By opening a GAIN Capital Group account or by using GAIN Capital Group Web sites, you give your consent to the collection and use of personal information by GAIN Capital Group as explained in this privacy statement.

Collection of personal information  
We collect information required to open an account, to transact business effectively and to safeguard your privacy. To do this, we gather information to help us assess your needs and preferences.

The information we collect directly from you includes information required to communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address. In addition, we collect information required by law to identify who you are, including your Social Security number, Passport number or Tax Identification number. We also collect demographic information when you open an account, including gender, birth date, occupation and employment status. Our regulatory bodies also require us to assess your trading experience, your approximate annual income, approximate net worth, and available risk capital, all to assess your financial position.

You directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do this by completing the account application and related documentation, by placing a trade, by sending us an e-mail, or by submitting information in response to a promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain information are by (1) observing your usage of the Web site, and (2) providing products and services to you. This information enables us to offer you products and services that should be of interest to you.

The information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet protocol ("IP") address, browser type, operating system, Internet service provider (ISP), time stamps, transactions placed, and banner ads you click. We do this through the use of cookies, which are small text files sent from the Web server and may be stored on your computer.

GAIN Capital Group affiliates and partners  
GAIN Capital Group may share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested or to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. GAIN Capital Group also forges partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, GAIN Capital Group may share some personal information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand the offers that are most relevant and useful.

Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.
