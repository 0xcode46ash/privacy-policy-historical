**Information We Collect and How It's Used**

**Information You Explicitly Provide**

**via Order Form:**  
To process your order, we require your name, billing address, phone number, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information. We use this information solely to process your order and, if any questions should arise, to contact you about your order. In general, we will try to contact you first by e-mail and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by phone. We process your orders ourselves, in house, and thus the sharing of this information is usually non-existent with any third parties. However, when we have to share this information, it will only be that information which is absolutely necessary, with those third parties that may be involved in the processing of your order in the future. For example, the financial institution that issued your credit card and the shipping carrier that delivers your order. Any sharing of personal information will be only with service providers (such as banks, credit card verifiers, etc.) in processing orders. When making a payment via the Paypal option be aware that you will be entering your personal and financial information on the Paypal website even though the Forzieri logo frames the top of the page. This for ease of navigation back to the Forzieri site. For information provided on the Paypal web site please refer to Paypal’s Privacy Policy. None of the information provided by the user to Paypal is shared back to the Forzieri site as all necessary information to process the order are already provided by the user to Forzieri before the payment. Paypal simply communicates to Forzieri the approval or not to accept the purchase. 

**via "Contact Us" E-mails**  
Should you decide to contact us through one of our e-mail addresses for a suggestion or problem via the Contact US form, you will be supplying your name and e-mail address and we will only use that information to send you a prompt reply.  
Service related or confirmation emails disclosure: because these emails are related to the service and are not promotional in nature, generally there is not opt-out or unsubscribe provided. Example is sending user name and password when a user registers for the first time.

**via Forzieri Privileges Club**  
If you sign up to become a member of our Forzieri Privileges Club, we will send an e-mail newsletter with our announcements and special offers from time to time until you decide to unsubscribe. Subscription to our newsletter is optional and requires your consent via our [Forzieri Privileges Club Page](http://www.forzieri.com/usa/privclub.asp?l=usa&c=usa) or by visiting our store in person and signing up. In order to unsubscribe from our newsletter, please [send us an email](http://www.forzieri.com/usa/help/help_webform.asp?l=usa&c=usa&areaInfo=M) with UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject.

**via Sweepstakes Entry Form**  
To enter our Sweepstakes, we require your name, mailing address, e-mail address and we require you to maintain a subscription to our free e-mail newsletter. The sweepstakes rules state that you give us permission, should you be a winner, to publish your name, city, state and country on our web site. Should you be a winner, we will notify you via e-mail and prize redemption instructions will be sent via postal mail to the address you gave us with your entry form. We will not use your personal information for any other purpose and you will not receive any additional mailings. Please be advised that sweepstakes will only occur from time to time.

**via Affiliate Program**  
To sign up for the Affiliate Program, you must fill out the general information form which includes your name, title, e-mail, phone, fax, address and then submit this form to: LinkShare, (this link is located directly on our web site) an independent 3rd party company that produces and manages affiliate tracking systems - they provide an independent accounting of all transactions and real-time, online reporting. Please be advised that all the information collected on the general information form stays with LinkShare not Forzieri.com. We can only contact you via LinkShare. You simply have to place a text link, a banner, or a graphic button (we will provide them) on your Web site, e-mail or newsletter. If you want to be deleted from this program just contact LinkShare directly at [www.linkshare.com](http://www.linkshare.com/). 

**via Wish List set-up**  
By creating a Wish List on the Forzieri Site you are required to provide your name and e-mail address. We use this information solely to make the wish list accessible to your person. Optionally, in case you wish to make your Wish List searchable by others, you can choose to provide some unique facts about your person, date of birth (please note that only month and day are asked for, not year of birth) and gift giving event type so to make it easier for your friends to recognize your list in our public list database. Also, optionally, you can provide your shipping address so that friends can buy direct from your Wish List and have items shipped direct to you. To protect your privacy, when choosing to make your list searchable, Forzieri DOES NOT display your full shipping address (only City and State) or e-mail address. We will not use Wish List data for additional mailings or marketing purposes. Shipping address only, in case provided, will be used to process orders -- see the "via Order Form" paragraph above.

**via Catalog Requests from**  
When requesting a catalog via our web form, you are required to provide your full name , shipping address and phone number. This information will not be shared or sold to third parties and you will not receive additional mailings other than the Forzieri catalogs. To opt-out from your catalog subscription please [contact us via e-mail](http://www.forzieri.com/usa/help/help_webform.asp?l=usa&c=usa&areaInfo=O)

**via Live Chat** (LivePerson)  
If you have questions about the Forzieri products, you have the option to use our "live chat" support service. This service asks you for a user name (you can use your real name or you can use an alias). Your individual chat session runs on a program by LivePerson. The chat transcript is saved in a secure location along with your IP address. This not only protects our customer care representatives against inappropriate chat content on the part of unscrupulous users, but it also allows us to pull up your previous chat session if you come back later and chat again. The LivePerson feature makes use of cookies on our website to facilitate one on one dialogue and to provide us insight into how our users navigate our website. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies. 

**via Tell-A-Friend**  
Forzieri discloses that when using the Tell-A-Friend service the user will be asked for the friends’ name and email addresses. These information are used exclusively for a one time invitation email and are not stored for future use.

**Information We Automatically Collect**

**Shopper ID**  
Upon visiting our site, we assign you a unique Shopper ID and attempt to store that onto your computer in the form of a cookie. This is used to keep track of your shopping basket during your visit and between visits. Cookies used by Forzieri.com are not tied to personally identifiable information. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of being assigned a Shopper ID, we recommend disabling cookie support in your browser (please see your browser documentation for specific procedures). You may still place an order by phone, fax or postal mail. Disabling cookie support will disable the shopping basket feature of our site.

**IP Address**  
We record IP addresses in the aggregate for monitoring the level of activity on our site, but we do not link this to your Shopper ID.

**Affiliate ID**  
If you entered our site by clicking a link on one of our affiliate web sites, we will attempt to store the ID of the affiliate as a cookie. We do this to ensure the affiliate receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. Your personally identifiable information will not be shared with any affiliates.

**Sharing of Information**

It is our privacy policy here at Forzieri to respect the privacy of our visitors to the utmost of our ability. We do not share your personally identifiable information with any other entities other than the necessary third parties in the normal processing of your orders. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Security**

We utilize industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. In addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when transferring your credit card data to our internal fulfillment system. To further enhance our security measures, our fulfillment system is not accessible via the Internet and we delete from our web site database all credit card information within 24 hours of receipt.

**Links**

We may include links to other sites and if you decide to follow those links, although we choose a site to which we may link very carefully based on their integrity and quality, we can't be responsible for the privacy policies and content of those sites. Generally, we will let you know when a link goes to another site.

**Changes in Privacy Statement/Information**

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

  
**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

**Glossary of Terms**

**Cookies**  
Cookies (we're not sure how they got this gastronomic name) are pieces of information that a web site stores in your computer. Temporary cookies only last as long as your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk (they take up very little space). Sites often use cookies to identify repeat visitors and offer them personalized service.

**IP Address**  
When you are connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique Internet ID called an IP address. Most people that connect through a dial-up service, such as America Online, get a different IP address each time they login. Others might have a permanently assigned IP address, called a static IP address. It is difficult or impossible for a web site to collect personal information about you (i.e., your name, e-mail address, etc.) from your IP address alone, though a static IP address makes this easier.

**Shopper ID**  
A unique ID assigned to each shopper that visits an online store with a shopping basket system. Each store you visit will assign you a different ID. Many stores use a cookie to save your Shopper ID for re-use when you return to that same store. Some shoppers find this convenient and others find it objectionable.

**SSL Encryption**  
A method by which information transmitted across the Internet is scrambled to the point where it's virtually indecipherable by anyone who should intercept the data before it reaches its destination. Most reputable online stores make use of SSL encryption to request credit card information and other sensitive data from their customers. Web pages where SSL encryption is activated are typically identified by a lock or key symbol displayed somewhere in your browser. Refer to your browser's documentation for the specific symbol and location.
