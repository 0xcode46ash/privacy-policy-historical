## ForeScout Technologies : Privacy Statement

We recognize and respect your need for privacy and security as you visit our site. When you visit our site to view any pages or read product information, you do so without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. While we do not collect identifying information about visitors to our site, we do use standard software to collect information for the strict purpose of tracking activity on our site. This allows us to better understand how many people use our site and which pages and features are most popular. The only information we normally collect and store is: 

  * The name of your Internet service provider. 
  * The web site that referred you to us (if any). 
  * The date and time the pages were accessed. 
  * The page or pages you requested. 

  
There are instances where you may elect to provide us with personal information. If you fill out one of our contract or registration forms or send us email, you are transmitting the information that appears to you in the form or the message. This will typically include information like your name, company, title, mailing address, email address, the kind of request you are making, and any other information necessary to fulfill your request. You never transmit personally identifying information that you do not enter yourself. And this is always your option; this information cannot be collected unless you specifically elect to send it to us. This information is used internally only for the purpose of fulfilling the request or for contacting you directly and is not given or sold to any other organization. 

We hope you find our website useful and informative and are always willing to answer questions and receive suggestions. If you have either, please e-mail the [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@forescout.com). 

* Effective February 2006. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy. A revised policy statement will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 30 days prior to its effective date.
