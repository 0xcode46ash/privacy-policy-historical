**OUR PRIVACY POLICY**   
Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited ("Ford") is committed to responsible privacy practices, to complying with the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and all other applicable legislation governing privacy. Where appropriate, Ford will handle personal information relying on the related bodies corporate exemption and the employee records exemption in the Privacy Act and any other applicable exmptions in other legislation. 

Our respect for our customers' privacy is paramount. We have policies and procedures to ensure that all personal information is handled in accordance with the National Privacy Principles. 

This Privacy Policy sets out our policies on the management of personal information - that is, how we collect personal information, the purposes for which we use this information, and to whom this information is disclosed.   


**What is personal information?**   
Personal information is information that could identify you. Examples of personal information include your name, address, telephone number and email address.   


**How do we collect and use your personal information?**   
One of the main ways in which Ford collects personal information is from Authorised Ford Dealers. For example, when you purchase a new Ford product, we collect personal information about you from your Authorised Ford Dealer in order to: 

  * ensure your purchase of a Ford vehicle is recorded and maintained for warranty purposes; 
  * ensure your purchase of a "Ford Solutions" product is recorded and maintained for administration purposes. 
  * inform you in the event of a field service action, including a recall, affecting your Ford vehicle; 
  * facilitate the provision of roadside assistance services; and 
  * contact you to obtain your feedback and to find out your level of satisfaction with our products, services and Dealers through surveys. 



If you consent, we may also use your information in order to keep you up to date with information about us and our products and services or to provide you with special offers. 

We may also collect personal information from you through transactions you have with us directly, such as through our contact centres, e.g. our Customer Relationship Centre, or online through our website and e-newsletters. Where we do this, we will endeavour to inform you why we are collecting your personal information, how we use that information and to whom we intend to disclose it.   


**What happens if you don't provide personal information?**   
Generally, you have no obligation to provide any personal information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold requested personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the products and services that depend on the collection of that information. As an example, if you did not provide the personal information requested on your new vehicle purchase, we would be unable to notify you directly of a product recall affecting your vehicle.   


**To whom do we disclose personal information?**   
We engage third party service providers to perform functions for Ford. Such functions include mailing, delivery of purchases, credit card payment authorisation, trend analysis, market research and promotions. 

For our service providers to perform those functions, it is sometimes necessary for us to disclose your personal information to those suppliers. Where disclosures take place, we work with our suppliers to ensure that all personal information we provide to them is kept secure, is only used to perform the task for which we have engaged them and is handled by them in accordance with the National Privacy Principles. 

From time to time, we provide statistical information about sales to industry bodies. This may comprise data collected about you and other customers to form aggregate results. However, we will not provide any information that identifies you as our customer.   


**How do we protect personal information?**   
At all times, we take great care to ensure your personal information is protected from unauthorised access, use, disclosure or alteration. 

We endeavour to ensure that our employees are aware of, and comply with, their obligations in relation to the handling of personal information. Only properly authorised employees are permitted to see or use personal information held by Ford and, even then, only to the extent that it is relevant to their roles and responsibilities. 

Your personal information will not be sold to any other organisation for that organisation's unrelated independent use. Further, we will not share your personal information with any organisations, other than those engaged by us to assist us in the provision of our products and services (as described above).   


**What about information you provide in job applications?**   
If you submit a job application to Ford, we will use the information provided by you to assess your application. Ford may disclose the information contained in your application to contracted service providers for purposes such as screening, aptitude testing, medical testing and human resources management activities. 

As part of the application process, you may be required to complete a pre-employment health questionnaire. In certain circumstances, you may also be asked to undergo a pre-employment medical assessment. In that case, you will be asked to give specific consent for Ford to disclose your questionnaire to its service providers for the purposes of arranging the medical assessment and for the relevant service providers to disclose the results of the assessment to Ford. 

If you refuse to provide any of the information requested by Ford, or to consent to the disclosure of the results of your medical assessment to Ford, we may be unable to consider your application. 

Ford may also ask you whether you agree to your personal information being provided to appropriate Ford suppliers so that you may be considered for positions with those suppliers which are relevant to your qualifications and experience.   


**Is the personal information we hold accurate?**   
We endeavour to maintain your personal information as accurately as reasonably possible. However, we rely on the accuracy of personal information as provided to us both directly and indirectly. We encourage you to contact us if the personal information we hold about you is incorrect or to notify us of a change in your personal information. Our contact details are set out below.   


**How can you access or correct the personal information we hold about you?**   
Wherever possible and appropriate, we will let you see the personal information we hold about you and correct it if it is wrong. If we do not allow you access to any part of the personal information we hold about you, we will tell you why. 

If you wish to obtain access to your personal information held by us, or to request us to correct any errors in that information, please contact us by: 

  * phoning the Ford Customer Relationship Centre on 13FORD (13 36 73); 
  * faxing the Ford Customer Relationship Centre on (03) 9929 3075; 
  * emailing us at customers@fordcrc.com.au; or 
  * writing to our Privacy Officer at Private Mail Bag 6, Campbellfield VIC 3061. 



**Who should you contact if you have concerns about our handling of personal information?**   
If you have any queries or concerns about the manner in which we have handled your personal information, please write to: 

**Privacy Officer**   
Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited   
Private Mail Bag 6   
Campbellfield VIC 3061 

We will send you written acknowledgement of your correspondence. We will investigate your query or concern and will advise you of the steps we have taken to answer or resolve it.   


**Changes to our Privacy Policy**   
We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time at our discretion and without notice. At any time, the latest version is available from our website at www.ford.com.au or our Customer Relationship Centre.
