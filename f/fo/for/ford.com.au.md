Where appropriate, Ford will handle personal information relying on the related bodies corporate exemption and the employee records exemption in the Privacy Act and any other applicable exemptions in other legislation. 

Our respect for our customers' privacy is paramount. We have policies and procedures to ensure that all personal information is handled in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

###  What is personal information?

Personal information is information that could identify you. Examples of personal information include your name, address, telephone number and email address. 

Back To Top

###  How do we collect and use your personal information?

One of the main ways in which Ford collects personal information is from Authorised Ford Dealers. For example, when you purchase a new Ford product, we collect personal information about you from your Authorised Ford Dealer in order to: 

  * ensure your purchase of a Ford vehicle is recorded and maintained for warranty purposes;
  * ensure your purchase of a "Ford Solutions" product is recorded and maintained for administration purposes.
  * inform you in the event of a field service action, including a recall, affecting your Ford vehicle;
  * facilitate the provision of roadside assistance services; and
  * contact you (directly or through its marketing research agencies) to obtain your feedback and to find out your level of satisfaction with our products, services and Dealers through surveys.



If you consent, we may also use your information in order to keep you up to date with information about us and our products and services or to provide you with special offers. 

We may also collect personal information from you through transactions you have with us directly, such as through our contact centres, e.g. our Customer Relationship Centre, promotional activities such as competitions, or online through our website, e-newsletters and interactive advertising banners. Where we do this, we will endeavour to inform you why we are collecting your personal information, how we use that information and to whom we intend to disclose it.

### What happens if you don't provide personal information?

Generally, you have no obligation to provide any personal information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold requested personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the products and services that depend on the collection of that information. As an example, if you did not provide the personal information requested on your new vehicle purchase, we would be unable to notify you directly of a product recall affecting your vehicle.

### To whom do we disclose personal information?

We engage third party service providers (including related companies of Ford which may be located outside Australia) to perform functions for Ford. Such functions include mailing, delivery of purchases, credit card payment authorisation, trend analysis, external audits, market research, facilitating electronic direct mailing, promotions and the provision of statistical sales information to industry bodies. 

For our service providers to perform those functions, it is sometimes necessary for us to disclose your personal information to those suppliers. Where disclosures take place, we work with these third parties to ensure that all personal information we provide to them is kept secure, is only used to perform the task for which we have engaged them and is handled by them in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

### How do we protect personal information?

At all times, we take great care to ensure your personal information is protected from unauthorised access, use, disclosure or alteration. 

We endeavour to ensure that our employees are aware of, and comply with, their obligations in relation to the handling of personal information. Only properly authorised employees are permitted to see or use personal information held by Ford and, even then, only to the extent that it is relevant to their roles and responsibilities. 

Your personal information will not be sold to any other organisation for that organisation's unrelated independent use. Further, we will not share your personal information with any organisations, other than those engaged by us to assist us in the provision of our products and services (as described above).

### What about information you provide in job applications?

If you submit a job application to Ford, we will use the information provided by you to assess your application. Ford may disclose the information contained in your application to contracted service providers for purposes such as screening, aptitude testing, medical testing and human resources management activities. 

As part of the application process, you may be required to complete a pre-employment health questionnaire. In certain circumstances, you may also be asked to undergo a pre-employment medical assessment. In that case, you will be asked to give specific consent for Ford to disclose your questionnaire to its service providers for the purposes of arranging the medical assessment and for the relevant service providers to disclose the results of the assessment to Ford. 

If you refuse to provide any of the information requested by Ford, or to consent to the disclosure of the results of your medical assessment to Ford, we may be unable to consider your application. 

Ford may also ask you whether you agree to your personal information being provided to appropriate Ford suppliers so that you may be considered for positions with those suppliers which are relevant to your qualifications and experience.

### Is the personal information we hold accurate?
