# ForeFlight - Privacy

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the [ForeFlight End User License Agreement](https://foreflight.com/eula) (“EULA”). The terms “ **ForeFlight** ,” “ **we** ,” and “ **us** ” include ForeFlight, LLC and our affiliates and subsidiaries. The Privacy Policy explains how ForeFlight may collect, use, and disclose information we obtain through the “Service.” Any capitalized terms used and not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to them in the EULA.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : By accessing or using the Service, you expressly consent to ForeFlight’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the EULA.

In general, “Personal Information” is information that can be used to readily identify, contact or locate you. Under U.S. privacy laws, “ **Personal Information** ” includes information such as: first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone number, fax number, email address or other online identifier, Social Security number or other third-party issued identifier, health information, credit card or other financial information (including bank account information), IP address and cookie information, or any other device-specific number or identifier. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

At ForeFlight, the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. Except for the limited purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not share or sell your personal information to third parties.
