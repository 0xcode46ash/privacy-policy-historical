# ForeFlight - Privacy Policy

### ForeFlight Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is critically important to us. At ForeFlight we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

ForeFlight, LLC. (“ForeFlight”) operates ForeFlight.com and produces ForeFlight Mobile, an iOS application available for download from iTunes App Store. It is ForeFlight’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites or apps.

**Website Visitors and App Customers**

Like most website or app operators, ForeFlight collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ForeFlight’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ForeFlight’s visitors use its website.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to ForeFlight’s websites choose to interact with ForeFlight in ways that require ForeFlight to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ForeFlight gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for the ForeFlight newsletter to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with ForeFlight – by purchasing access to ForeFlight Mobile from ForeFlight.com, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ForeFlight collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the customer’s interaction with ForeFlight or its apps. ForeFlight does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Aggregated Statistics**

ForeFlight may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites or use of its apps. ForeFlight does not display this information publicly or provide it to others.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

ForeFlight discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ForeFlight’s behalf or to provide services available at ForeFlight’s websites or its apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. ForeFlight will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ForeFlight discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ForeFlight believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ForeFlight, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a ForeFlight app and have supplied your email address, ForeFlight may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ForeFlight and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ForeFlight takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifyinginformation.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ForeFlight uses cookies to help ForeFlight identify and track visitors, their usage of ForeFlight website, and their website access preferences. ForeFlight visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ForeFlight’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ForeFlight’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Business Transfers**

If ForeFlight, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ForeFlight goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ForeFlight may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Ads**

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ForeFlight and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Comments**

Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, ForeFlight may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in ForeFlight’s sole discretion. ForeFlight encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site or apps after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. We will notify you in the event our privacy policy changes.
