Fortrade Limited (“Fortrade”) ensures its clients’ personal data is protected at all times.
We have put in place state-of-the-art security procedures and controls to provide you a safe and
secure trading environment. The collection of personal data (your name, address, phone number,
email, and ID details) is required for Compliance and Regulatory purposes when you submit a
request via our online applications. This information is required in order for us to be able to
communicate with you, and, as required by law, to identify who you are. We will contact you by
email to either: request further information from you; let you know of your account status; make
you aware any financial market developments that might affect you; and inform you of any offers
that we may be running.
Fortrade does not sell, lease or disclose personal data to third party affiliates or non-affiliates,
except for the reasons described below:
           In order to occasionally provide you with information on products and services you have
            requested, or
           To offer you an opportunity to participate in the products and services our reputable
            affiliates offer, in which case we may share your information with them.
Fortrade also reserves the right to disclose personal information to non-affiliated third parties for
regulatory or reporting purposes as required by law, to protect our rights or property.
You can unsubscribe from all communications by simply clicking on the unsubscribe link placed
in the end of every email communication we send.
When we consider information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify
you or we will securely destroy the records.
We endeavour to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate and up-to-date. We
realise that this information changes frequently with changes of address and other personal
circumstances. We can generally update your customer information over the telephone.
