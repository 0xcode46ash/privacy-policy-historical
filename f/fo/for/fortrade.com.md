further information from you; let you know of your account status; make you aware any
financial market developments that might affect you; and inform you of any offers that
we may be running.

       have requested, or
•      To offer you an opportunity to participate in the products and services our
       reputable affiliates offer, in which case we may share your information with them.
Fortrade also reserves the right to disclose personal information to non-affiliated third
parties for regulatory or reporting purposes as required by law, to protect our rights or
property.
