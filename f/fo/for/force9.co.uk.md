Privacy Policy statement**

Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Below is a summary of our policy. 

**What personal information do we collect?**

In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. 

However, Some of our sites require registration to access. 

There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. 

  
**Protecting your privacy**

We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. 

We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Force9 uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you.) 

Our websites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, you are responsible for reviewing and abiding by the privacy policies of these third party sites. 

  
**Use of cookies**

Force9 websites use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the website are of interest to our visitors. These cookies do not track individual information. Force9 also uses cookies when you register for one of our web programs. In this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our website to remember you when you return to visit us. Cookies from Force9 websites can only be read by Force9 websites. 

**  
Data storage**

Many of our websites that collect information will store and process that information in databases. 

_How can you update the personal information you have provided to Force9?_  
You can help Force9 maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying Force9 of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. You may do this online or through customer support by following the instructions on the "manage my account" pages.

  
**Questions?**

Force9 welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this section.
