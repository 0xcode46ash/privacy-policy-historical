# Ford Vehicles: Help - Privacy

**We value your trust**   
The cornerstone of every relationship is built on trust. When you consider purchasing one of our vehicles and visit our web site to conduct your research, that to us, is the beginning of a relationship. We want you to feel comfortable while you're conducting that research. We want you to feel confident that the information we collect, and that you choose to share, will be treated with care. The first step in helping you to achieve that level of comfort and confidence is by explaining (in plain English) exactly what types of information we collect and why we collect it. It is our sincere hope that by being forthright in this communication of our Privacy Policy that the relationship we establish is a long-lasting one. 

**Our Pledge**

  * We will never share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties.  
When we refer to **non-affiliated third parties** we mean organizations outside of Ford Motor Company with whom we do not have an association. For example, many of our promotions for sweepstakes and giveaways are made possible by marketing partnerships and alliances with companies whose customers have like interests as those customers who drive Ford vehicles. Our partnerships with Harley-Davidson® and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum are examples of **"affiliated" third parties** with whom we may share information, but only if we have your permission to do so, and only with that specific sponsor. Local Ford dealers are another example of "affiliated" third parties we may share your data with. Finally, we may share your data with companies who provide data handling or other services to us, but such companies will be contractually bound not to use your information except for the purposes of our contract with them. 


  * We will never knowingly collect data from persons under 13 years or age.

**Normal Web Site Usage**   
During a normal visit to our site, no personally identifiable information about you is collected. All information about our vehicles is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide us with any personal information. Your visit does however generate a session log. 

**Session Logs: What they are and how we use them.**   
When you visit any web site, the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." The logs are used by the owners of the sites to track the pages you visit or request. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which by the way, contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. 

We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. 

**Cookies: What they are and how we use them.**   
Another method of tracking web site visitors is through the use of "Cookies." Cookies are small bits of data that also help web site owners and web servers identify you and remember you when you return. By doing this, the web site owner and web server can provide you with information that is most valuable to you, based on your last visit. 

Important Cookie Facts: 

  * Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a Web site, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine your name or e-mail address unless you choose to enter it into a pre-existing input box. 
  * Allowing a Web site to create a cookie does not give that site or any other site access to the rest of your computer. 
  * Cookies cannot roam around inside your computer and collect personal information. 
  * Only the site that created the cookie can read it. 



There are two types of cookies: 

  * The first type, a session cookie, only stays in your computer during the time you are logged into a particular site. When you leave the site, the cookie automatically deletes itself. 
  * The other type, called a persistent cookie, can have an indefinite shelf life or have a predetermined expiration date built in. These types of cookies are primarily used to remember you for a specified period of time. For instance, if you sign up for membership in a club, or enter a sweepstakes that requires you to participate over a length of time, persistent cookies are used to remember you. Another example is with web sites that offer the ability to personalize the way the page is displayed. 



**Ford Division Cookie Examples:**   
Password Protected Areas: 

  * In the Ford Division web site, we use both types of cookies. For instance, if an area of our site is password protected, and you select a check box asking us to "remember" your password, that information is stored in cookie form on your hard drive. If you don't select the checkbox no cookie is created and you would have to log in to the password protected area the next time you visited. So in this case, cookies help us serve information to you faster. 



**How to Prevent Cookies**   
If you are concerned about being identified or about having your web browsing traced through the use of a cookie, you can prevent them from being deposited in your computer. You can also set your browser to warn you whenever a cookie is being deposited. 

Remember though that the majority of web sites use cookies and that blocking all cookies will prevent some online services from working. An e-commerce or shopping site, for example, likely uses cookies in their shopping process. Also, setting your browser to warn you can also become quite annoying. 

We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to this Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. To learn more about our third party ad serving partner, cookies, and how to "opt-out" of the ad serving cookie, please [click here.](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/)

**Detecting Your System's Performance Level**   
Sometimes, prior to serving a web page, a web server will use a simple html program to check the speed of your Internet connection or the existence of certain plug-ins or software. An example would be to detect which version of a particular browser you are using or which version of the Macromedia Flash plug-in you have. Once identified, the server delivers the page or Flash movie to match the performance level or version of the software or plug-in in your system. The benefit is that you always see the content in its optimum state. 

Not all web site owners do this simply because it means having to build multiple versions of content. In fact, most simply offer a statement on their homepage to the effect that "This site is best viewed using Microsoft IE 4.0 and/or Netscape 4.0 etc." 

In the fordvehicles.com web site, we sometimes check your Internet connection speed in order to deliver multi-media content such as streaming video or audio at its optimum viewing level. 

**Personal Information: What it is and how we use it.**   
Before we get into how and why we gather information about you, be assured of two things: One, we will never share your personal information with any non-affiliated third party (Please see earlier explanation of "non-affiliated".). And Two, we will never send you unsolicited e-mail based on your interaction with this site. Of course you may have provided your e-mail address to Ford in some other situation in which case you may receive e-mail stemming with that interaction. 

Personal information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and in some cases your phone number is collected to respond to your requests for future contact. There are obvious areas within our site where collecting personal information is unavoidable. For instance, when you request a brochure or enter a contest. Some of the information we ask for is mandatory and required to fulfill the request. Other information we ask for is optional and we use that to help us better understand you and better define how we market and sell our vehicles or design our communications. 

Required information is always indicated by an asterisk next to the input box. 

**Secure Socket Layers (SSL): What it is and how we use them.**   
Reputable sites that collect sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers that you use for purchasing products and services over the internet pass your information through what is called "Secure Socket Layers" or SSL. This is encryption technology that helps safeguard your personal information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. 

All information we collect from you that contains personally identifiable information is passed through SSL. 

**Protecting Your Children's Privacy**   
We will never knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that any personally identifiable information collected is from a person under 13 years of age, that information will be deleted from our database. More information can be found online at the FTC's [Children's Privacy Web site](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm). 

**Outside Links: What they are and how we use them.**   
An outside link refers to any link that takes you to a site not controlled by Ford Division. Many of our contests and sweepstakes are conducted in conjunction with media partners such as magazine publishers. Many times as part of the promotional agreement, we provide links to that partner's Web site. 

If you have a concern about that Web site's practices, you should carefully read their Privacy Policy before submitting any personal information. 

**Downloadable files: What they are and how we use them.**   
Downloading files refers to the act of choosing to receive a file or program from a web site. Examples are a web browser, a sound file, movie file or screensaver. Downloadable files are usually executables. Meaning that once they are downloaded, clicking on them launches or installs a program or deposits files on your computer. Whenever you download a file from a web site, you will always be given the choice of where you would like to save the file. Unless you explicitly trust the site delivering the downloadable, it is a good idea to save the file to disk before opening or activating it. 

We use downloadable files to deliver things like screensavers, wallpaper and electronic brochures. If information on our site requires a particular piece of software to view it, we will provide a link for you to acquire that software. Examples are plug-ins for your browser that allow you to view files like Macromedia Flash or Shockwave, Adobe Acrobat, the Quick Time player or Real Player. We rarely, if ever, will require you to download an uncommon piece of software or program to view our information. 

**Requests from Law Enforcement Agencies**   
Ford Division reserves the right to share information collected from our web site with law enforcement agencies who are in the process of conducting lawful investigations. 

**Scope of Content:**   
The Ford Division Web site (www.fordvehicles.com), contains information that is intended solely for the United States. The Ford Division products and promotional programs mentioned in our Web site are subject to availability in your area. Any prices given as Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price ("MSRP") are in U.S. dollars and do not include extra costs such as title, taxes or registration. When you build and price a vehicle you may be shown invoice and the Ford Direct Price. Total Invoice is the amount that Ford Motor Company charges its dealer for a vehicle. Total Invoice may not represent the actual dealer cost, as there are holdbacks, floor plan financing, assistance, dealer advertising fund fees, shipping, and charges for gasoline that may be included in the total invoice. The Ford Direct Price includes the base price for the selected vehicle, factory options, and destination charges. The Ford Direct Price does not include tax, title, and license fees established at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition, the Ford Direct Price does not include dealer documentation fees charged to the consumer, or items that may have been added while the vehicle is in inventory.
