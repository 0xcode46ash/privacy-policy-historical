# Privacy Policy

Formica Group ("Formica") respects the privacy of visitors to its websites and other individuals about whom we collect personal information. In this policy “we” means Formica Limited which manages the personal data collected either by us or by the companies listed in the “[about us](http://www.formica.com/en/uk/about-formica-group)” section of the Formica website. Formica Group is a collective term for those entities displayed on the ‘about us’ section of the website via the link above, along with all subsidiaries, affiliates and companies sharing ownership with Fletcher Building Limited.

We are the data controller in respect of your personal information that we collect and process as further described in this Privacy Policy. As described below, we may share your personal information with other organizations that may receive and process your personal information as a data controller in their own right. 

We provide this "Privacy Policy," to demonstrate our commitment to protect your privacy. We reserve the right to update the Privacy Policy at any time, without notice. We encourage you to visit this page periodically and review the then current terms.

This Privacy Policy discloses the current privacy practices of Formica and by using our website, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of this information in the manner described. When personal information is collected, other than through the website, it will be explained to you how that information will be used, but it will always be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, or would like us to delete your personal information from our records, you should contact us, Formica Limited at [website.eu@formica.com](mailto:website.eu@formica.com).

### The Information Collected by Formica Group

We may collect and store personal information, such as your name, e-mail address and phone number to respond to questions, and to process or fill orders or requests. We may use this information to provide goods and services that you request and to let you know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested. We also use this information to customize your experience using our website.

We may also retain transaction and experience information, such as information about your transactions with us, as well as information about our communications with you. Examples include your account history, requests for information and our responses. We may match user information we collect with other data available from other sources in order to carry out our business and to provide our goods and services and to conduct advertising and promotions more effectively.

For product or service orders, Formica may need additional information in order to process or to fulfill your order or request. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Formica will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission, except as otherwise necessary to (i) process or fulfill your order, (ii) respond to your request or answer your enquiries, (iii) comply with any applicable law, court order or other judicial process.

Formica may use one or more third-party payment processors to facilitate product ordering and payment. Formica may not gather your personal information when you arrange payment through one of these processors. Rather, that information is gathered, stored and processed by the third-party payment processor. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any third party payment processors protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will disclose on the website when you are using a third party payment provider’s services.

We may ask you for personally-identifying information at other times, such as if and when you communicate with us, or request that we communicate with you.

In addition, we may automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased and the like, but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this information in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use our website (or parts thereof) so we can improve our website. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission.

As part of our service, we may use "cookies" to store and, at times, track information about you. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to reenter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users, research visiting patterns, and help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners track visits and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, retail partners and advertisers that may from time to time appear on our website may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. Please consult your specific browser instructions to learn more about these features. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to reenter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable.

### The Way Formica Uses and Disclose Information

We do not sell or rent personal information without your permission. We may, however, transfer your information in the event that we transfer ownership of all or a significant part of Formica's stock, assets or business to a third party.

If you place a request for products or services, we use information to ship your order; if the products or services are from a retail partner, we may provide your relevant information to that retailer for purposes of the transaction.

We rely upon third parties for important elements of our operations so we will provide your personal information, such as your name, address, and account information to these third parties so that they can do their job, such as service providers, financial service providers, marketing companies that help us market our products. We will take appropriate steps to protect your information in these circumstances. These third parties also may have their own privacy policies but are not permitted to use the data for their own purposes.

We may also share the information it collects about you with third parties including retailers, credit card issuers and processors, banks and other financial institutions and government agencies.

During the normal course of doing business, Formica may share your information within the Formica Group as necessary in order to service your accounts or orders you place with us and for the other purposes set out above.

We may use your personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize the content, layout and services of our website.

We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests. We may ask you to voluntarily provide additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests, which we may use to customize our service for you.

We may use your e-mail address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to our products and services. If you do not wish to receive these communications, please contact us as indicated above in this Privacy Policy.

We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use or purchase agreements. At times, we may review status or activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever it is believed, in good faith, that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our web site and to enhance our web site based on the usage pattern data we receive. 

### Security

We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information.

If you establish an account with us through this website, your account information and profile will be password-protected. It is recommended that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online--for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas--that information can be collected and used by others. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

### How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information

You can access the information that we collect online and maintain through normal updating methods. To update, correct or delete this information, you can contact [website.eu@formica.com](mailto:website.eu@formica.com).

Your account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so may result in your not being able to access or receive certain services. 

### Children

Our web site is not intended for children and we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our web site, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information.

### Third Party Practices

The privacy policy of an advertiser, payment processor or service provider you may contact through our site may differ from the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read that policy before responding to the offer or dealing with that party.

### Sending Personally Identifying Information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)

As Formica is multi-national group of companies, there are occasions where your personal information may be transmitted or shared outside of the EEA. Your personal information may be transmitted or shared outside of the EEA for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, the purposes set out above.

Where personal information is sent, by Formica, outside of the EEA Formica shall take reasonable steps to ensure the transfer of such personal information is secure; and that adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure that it is processed securely when held outside of the EEA.
