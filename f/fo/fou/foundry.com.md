## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is made available to you in order to make you aware of how Foundry Networks, Inc. ("Foundry") collects and uses personal information you provide to us or collected via your visit to the Foundry website.

By accessing the Foundry website, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to Foundry's processing of Personal Information for the purposes given below, as well as those that may appear on the web pages where you provide your Personal Information to us. For additional restrictions on your use of the website, please see our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-use.html) and our [Trademarks and Logo Usage Policy](https://web.archive.org/trademark-policy.html).

#### 1\. Personal Information

Your "Personal Information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name and mailing address.

#### 2\. Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Foundry to remember your login and password or you expressly provide Personal Information to us. Foundry may record information about your website visit, such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed.

Foundry collects Personal Information when you register with Foundry for a Foundry account, when you use certain Foundry products or services, when you register to attend a training session or class, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, when you request information about Foundry products or services, or when you submit your information to Foundry for any other reason. 

Foundry may use information you provide to us to contact you or your company for marketing purposes. If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the website, we may transfer that information within Foundry or to Foundry's third party service providers, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

#### 3\. Your Control over Your Personal Information

New registrants may choose to limit use of their Personal Information. We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

When you sign up for an email list, you will be given instructions at that time on how to remove yourself from that list.

The use of those webpages and the information or programs downloadable from those pages are governed by a written agreement between your employer and/or Foundry and the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-use.html).
