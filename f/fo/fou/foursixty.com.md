### Last Updated: February 18, 2014

This is the Privacy Policy of the Foursixty website (the “Site”), operated by Foursixty Inc. (together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, “Foursixty”, “we”, “us”, “our” and terms of similar meaning) and our related products and services. It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use and disclose this information. 

By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration or by visiting and using the Site, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/460/terms_conditions). 

In this Privacy Policy, we use the term “User” to describe different types of visitors to our Site, including registered users of our Site and casual browsers. 

### How We Use Your Information

We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to provide to you the services offered by the Site; resolve service and billing disputes; troubleshoot problems; bill any amounts due from you; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, events and updates; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your interests, such as product news; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use; provide you with system or administrative messages, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. On occasion we use email address or other contact information to contact our Users to ask them for their input on our services. 

We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site. 

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe in the email. If you wish to no longer receive our newsletters you may update the settings in your account, follow the instructions located in the email, or you may contact us at [help@foursixty.com](mailto:help@foursixty.com). 

### What Information Do We Collect?

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you become a User, we require you to provide various contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site (which vary, depending on what kind of User you are), and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. 

In addition, as you use the Site, you can from time to time enter or send to us personal information. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being collected. 

We use cookies and log data in various ways, as described below. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we use “persistent” cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site. Second, we use “session ID” cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and close your browser. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site. 

When you use our Site, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends (“log data”). This log data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Site’s technical administration, to increase the Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. 

We may also use other third-party services to assist us in using and analyzing these tools and the data they provide, and in monitoring your use of the Site. 

Following your registration on the Site, you can review and change your information in your account area. If you disclose personal information in any posting in our forum or blog and wish to have it removed, please contact us at the support contact information listed below, and posted on the Site. 

### Our Disclosure of Your Information

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services: 

Anonymized Aggregated Data. We aggregate and anonymize Site use information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to Users and others. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally. 

Public Display or Display to other Users. If you post on our forum or blog your username and other information you include is displayed in your postings or comments, and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities in the public areas of the forum will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published content. When you register through the Site and submit personal information to create a User profile or a collection, other users will see your name. If you choose to provide additional personal information in your profile, other users will see that additional personal information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location, website and biography. Providing additional personal information is voluntary. We recommend that you avoid disclosing any information you consider sensitive and confidential. 

Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers. We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Site, and may disclose personal information to them in the course of our use of their services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

Legal Requests and Business Transitions; Emergencies. Foursixty may disclose any of your personal information in our possession if we believe it necessary or appropriate to do so (a) to respond to any governmental authority as part of an investigation to determine our compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation (including privacy laws, rules, and regulations), (b) in response to a court order, subpoena, discovery request or other lawful request, or judicial or administrative proceeding, (c) as otherwise required under any applicable law, rule, or regulation, (d) to protect or defend the rights or property of Foursixty and other users, or (e) if Foursixty is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets (you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information). 

### Controlling Your Information

Your friend may contact us at [help@foursixty.com](mailto:help@foursixty.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

### Security

The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once Foursixty receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Site and in our Terms of Use. 

### Other Information Collectors

To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Site, different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

### Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information

To review, delete and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, you may login into your account to make the changes, or you may contact us at privacy@Foursixty.com.

### Additional Policy Information

Invitations: You have the opportunity to invite others to work with you through your Foursixty account. To do that, Foursixty asks you to import or to manually enter your contacts’ email addresses. As you direct, we then send them an invitation on your behalf or other notices reflecting changes you make to their status in your account. 

If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will leave the Foursixty site and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third-party product or service in conjunction with Foursixty, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Foursixty. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a Foursixty site, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at [help@foursixty.com](mailto:help@foursixty.com).
