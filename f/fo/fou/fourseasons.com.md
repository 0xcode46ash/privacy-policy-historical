Privacy Policy Statement For www.fourseasons.com 

* * *

In addition to reviewing this Statement, please read our Legal Notice. Your use of www.fourseasons.com constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in the Notice. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts takes seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy on-line. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to better familiarize you with our information gathering and dissemination practices for the web site www.fourseasons.com, so that you will understand our practices regarding this matter, and how they pertain to you as you make full use of our offerings.

What information is collected about you and how do we use it? 

* * *

**A) Initially Upon Contact With Our Web Site**  
When you visit our web site, you are initially given a "cookie", and your computer is assigned an ID number. A cookie is a commonly used device which stores information placed by a web site in a storage place on your own computer. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. We use cookies to track your computer's usage patterns on our site, and to enhance your visit to the site. We also use cookies to collect and maintain aggregate web site data (such as the number of visitors to a particular site) which helps us see which areas are popular with our users and which are not. Among other things, this helps us improve and update the site, based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. If you don't like cookies, your web browser likely includes an option that allows you not to accept them. We don't recommend using this option, however, as it makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience because the site is not able to recognize you and your preferences for information.

Once you have visited our web site and accepted our cookie, your ID number is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf our web site. Despite the fact that you remain anonymous until you enter personal information in the web site, the ID number allows us to log your session, so that we may better assist you should you need some individualized service or support. Once you enter personal information in the web site, we associate your ID number with your contact information so we can recognize you on a future visit. We also use it to keep track of your "hot buttons" (information that appears to be of personal interest to you).

**B) While Browsing Our Web Site**  
While in the process of browsing our web site, you also provide us with information which doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of destination you're seeking information about, for example. We use this aggregated, anonymous data mainly for editorial purposes, but we don't connect it to any name, address, or other identifying information.

While you explore our web site for the information that interests you, you may wish to put in a specific "Information Request" about one of our hotels or resorts, or you may wish to participate in one of our on-line surveys or promotions. To respond to this request or to participate in our various programs , we may ask you for your name, zip/postal code, e-mail address, and phone number. In the event you choose to provide us with this information, we will only use it for the purpose we have specified to you, unless you request otherwise. Further, we will only e-mail you if you want us to - you can choose a number of methods by which to receive a reply to a request. Transmittal of your personal data shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Statement. And if you don't want to give us this information over the internet, that's fine too \- you can always call our Worldwide Reservations Office for more details.

If you wish, you may also submit your e-mail address in order to be placed on a subscription list or to receive other information. You will be placed on these lists unless you indicate your desire not to be included. In deciding whether or not to join such lists, please note that they are only used for internal purposes - we do not sell or rent our lists to anyone. In the event you choose to join one of our lists, you may request to be removed from the list at any time.

**C) To Make A Reservation**  
If you decide you want to make a reservation at any of our hotels or resorts, you will be linked to our reservation service site. Although it appears to be part of our site, the reservation site is in fact provided by someone else. We pass your computer ID number on to them, but they are unfamiliar with you. You can search for rates and availability at our hotels and resorts without providing any personal information.

Once you have determined that your requested reservation is available, you will be asked to give personal information including your name, address and contact information, as well as certain guarantee and deposit information to secure your reservation, including your credit card number. Transmittal of your personal data shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Statement. This site is secure. No one else is able to read the information you provide to the reservation site. Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence, but we do not authorize any payments at this point. Once your reservation is confirmed, Four Seasons will be sent all of the reservation information. From this point the information is sent to the selected hotel in exactly the same way as if you called us directly or if your travel agent made the reservation. We also receive a copy of the reservation at our web site except for your credit card number connected to your ID number. We will then use that information to create a log in our web site database. We also occasionally use it in aggregate for marketing services. However, we will not use it to market to you without your express permission.

We will never share any of your personally identifying data with any other party without your express permission, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes.

* * *

What Information Is Secure And What Isn't? 

* * *

We always take the utmost care to ensure that the data we obtain from you is not used in a way that you may be unaware of or not agreeable to. For example, due to the personal nature of the information you give when making a reservation, the reservation system is secure, such that your credit card number is protected. However, there are a few special cases worth noting when you are contemplating giving personal information to us.

It is important to note that any e-mail communication to and from our site is not secure. This is a risk inherent in the use of e-mail. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms to us by e-mail (from the Contact Us section of the site). We recommend that you do not include any confidential information when using the e-mail forms in the site (for example do not provide credit card numbers here). For your protection, our e-mail responses to you will not include any confidential information.

Finally, Four Seasons cannot expressly warrant the operation of the reservation web site and/or matters relating to its security once you log on, as it is not our site. To be prudent, please be sure to always log off when you are done using the reservation site. Although the site will log off automatically after 15 minutes, it is best to log off immediately upon completion, since while you are logged on it is easier for someone to attempt to get access to your profile.
