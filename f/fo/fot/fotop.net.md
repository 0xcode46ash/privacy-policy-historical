**Privacy**

fotop.net is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. However, sometimes we do need information to provide services, and this privacy policy explains data collection and use in those situations.

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. Information collected by fotop.net is limited to your name and e-mail address. We will not give out your information or sell it to others. Further, we will not send you unsolicited email or "spam."

Your email address is collected in order to have an address to send you lost password notifications. Your email address is never displayed publicly. We will only send you mail once when you create your account, and when there's someone signed your guestbook or comment on your photos.
