Privacy Policy   
Your privacy is important to Fotor. Our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. As you use our services, we want our policies to be clear and to assist you with protecting your privacy. Whether you are new to Fotor or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices. 

Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

We may collect non-personal information, such as data that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. Non-personal data is collected, used, transferred, and disclosed for a number of purposes, including for the use of cookies and other technologies to improve our services and better understand the needs of our users. A "cookie" is a small data file that is transferred to your device. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. We use information collected from cookies to improve user experience and the overall quality of our services.

Transparency and choice

You may set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services. However, it's important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. You can also control which social websites you upload images to. The images you upload to Fotor.com are not public and no one will have access to your images without your permission. 

Third party account

Fotor does not store your Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr passwords. Your accounts are not divulged to Fotor and you are free to repeal your social website connection with Fotor at any time.

Enforcement

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self-regulatory practices. If we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who has made the complaint and follow up with appropriate actions. 

Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change occasionally. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without providing excplicit, advanced notice. We will also post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
