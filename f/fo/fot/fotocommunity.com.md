## INFOnline/IVW

INFOnline/IVW data protection declaration on the use of scalable central measurement procedure.

Our Website uses the “scalable central measurement process” provided by INFOnline GmbH to collect statistical data on how our service is being utilised. This process gathers anonymous measurements. The range of scalable measurement which is undertaken is used to recognise computer systems and in this process, a cookie labelled “ivwbox.de” is used, or alternatively a signature is created out of various pieces of information which are automatically generated by your computer. IP addresses are not stored during this procedure and they are evaluated in anonymised form. The range of scalable measurement was developed with data protection requirements in mind. The purpose of this measurement process is to produce statistics showing how intensively a website is being used, and how may users there are. At no point are any individual users identified. Your identity is always protected. You will not receive any advertising through this system. All internet services which are members of the IVW organisation (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.), or which participate in the “internet facts” study conducted by AGOF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung), user statistics are published monthly by AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. (ag.ma), and by IVW and these can be viewed at: http://www.agof.de/, https://www.agma-mmc.de/ und http://www.ivw.eu/ at any time. Besides publishing the measurement data, the IVW also monitors the scalable measurement process to check that it meets the requirements of the relevant data protection laws. You can find more information on the scalable measurement process on the INFOnline website (https://www.infonline.de/), which is the company undertaking the measurement, and also the data protection pages located at AGOF (http://www.agof.de/datenschutz-mobile/) and the data protection pages at IVW (http://www.ivw.eu/). You can opt out of the scalable measurement process via the following link: http://optout.ivwbox.de/
