* **WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO OTHERS**

We may disclose Personal Information in limited situations to our affiliated companies, agents and contracted parties such as service providers for the purpose of processing such information on behalf of Fold3. iArchives is responsible for the management of the jointly used personal information.  In addition, as our business continues to evolve, in the event that Fold3 is acquired by or merged into a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer and assign the information we have collected from our Users, in whole or in part, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale or other change of control. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other equitable or legal action involving creditor's rights, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used, and you hereby consent to such transfers. 

We require where necessary that these parties process the information in compliance with our Privacy Statement. We use reasonable efforts to make sure such information is secure and to limit others' use of such information.  See "Data Security" section below for more information.  Despite the steps that we take, we cannot guarantee that in all instances Personal Information will not be disclosed. We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information under the following circumstances:

  * When required to do so by law or court order, or to comply with a discovery request, subpoena or search warrant. For example (and without limitation), we may disclose Personal Information in connection with investigations by law enforcement personnel or tax officials or in connection with inquiries by government administrative officials or regulators.
  * With your knowledge and/or any relevant consents.
  * When we conclude, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations, to protect the security or integrity of the Fold3 Website, and to protect the rights, property or safety of Fold3 and its Users or any other person. 


* **NON PERSONAL INFORMATION, IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES**

 **Aggregate Information:** Through our contracts with third-party service providers, we use technology that lets us know what type of browser you are using, the website from which you enter the Fold3 Website, and the pages you view as you visit Fold3. This technology helps us compile aggregated statistics about our Users and their use of the Fold3 Website. We use these statistics to improve the design and content of Fold3 and to prepare and deliver our marketing programs. We also aggregate Personal Information to provide non-personally identifiable information for sale to other businesses. This "Aggregate Information" does not contain any personally identifiable information and is used for demographic studies, benchmarking, and other advertising and marketing purposes. Aggregate Information cannot be traced back to specific users by third parties other than third parties who are acting as our agents, in which case those agents will have in place privacy policies that comply with the principles and objectives of this Privacy Statement. 

**"Cookies":** Through our contracts with third-party service providers, we use technology such as "cookies" and "web beacons" on the Fold3 Website to help us analyze the use of our Website. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that allow us to monitor the web traffic patterns on our Website and to compile data for various reports. Cookies also allow your computer to remember certain information that you have already entered so that you do not have to reenter it. We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. Session cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website. Persistent cookies remain in your cookie file for a much longer period of time, depending on the lifetime of the specific cookie. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies—you should check the "Help" menu on your browser to learn about setting your cookie preferences. However, some features on the Fold3 Website are only available through the use of cookies. We use web beacons—a small image that accesses our cookies—to tell us, for example, whether a User opened an email from us or opened an advertisement placed on our site. Please note that Fold3 allows third-party advertisers that are presenting advertisements on our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. These advertisers may also use their own web beacons. The advertisers' use of cookies and web beacons is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Statement. 

You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain Fold3 services may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please click [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://web.archive.org/external.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.allaboutcookies.org%2F).

Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use such non-personal information for any purpose.  In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personal information, with other third parties, for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).  If we do combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information, as long as it is combined, and its use by us will be subject to this Privacy Statement.

**_"IP Addresses"_** We have to use your IP address to deliver the Website and our service to you and to help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.

* **A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS**

Fold3 obtains large collections of historical documents from various sources and converts the documents into a digital format so that Users may see a facsimile of the original. Fold3 and its affiliates and agents take reasonable steps to assure that the documents do not include sensitive, Personal Information about living individuals. If you believe that a document published by Fold3 violates your privacy rights, please contact us [**here**](https://web.archive.org/contact/) **** and we will attempt to resolve the matter quickly.

Fold3 also permits its Members and All-Access Members to post their own historical documents, to annotate historical documents and to post commentary on Memorial Pages and on historical documents. Although in our Terms of Service we prohibit Users from posting content that violates the privacy rights of others (see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/termsandconditions/)) for more information), we do not edit or approve User Provided Content. It is possible that a Member or All-Access Member will post your private information. If you believe that a User has posted Personal Information about you that violate your rights please contact us [**here**](https://web.archive.org/contact/) **** and we will attempt to resolve the matter quickly. 

* **THIRD PARTY LINKS**

The Fold3 Website may contain links to other sites. When you click on one of those links, you are accessing a website that is not owned, operated, or controlled by Fold3 or any of its affiliates. The operator of such site may have its own privacy Statement (which we encourage you to read carefully), and that Statement will govern the collection and use of your data on that site. Fold3 does not share your Personal Information with these parties and is not responsible for their privacy practices.

* **ONGOING TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The Personal Information that you provide to us may be transferred across state or national borders for the purposes of data storage, consolidation, retrieval, analysis or the effective management of customer information. Before Fold3 begins to transfer Personal Information to any third party acting as our agent, we will confirm that they have adopted, are subject to, or are contractually obligated to comply with the principles and objectives of this Privacy Statement.

* **ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT DETAILS**

To manage you privacy settings on Fold3 go to the Account Details section of the Website and review your Account Details.

* **REPORTING, CHANGING OR DELETING INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF**

Fold3 will maintain procedures consistent with applicable law for individuals to gain access to their collected Personal Information and, when appropriate, correct or delete their Personal Information. Members and All-Access Members may update, correct or delete their profiles online. If you have other concerns about your Personal Information, you may email us at support@fold3.com.

* **DATA SECURITY**

We will take reasonable precautions in line with industry practice to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use Secure Sockets Layer software, which encrypts information you submit so that it cannot be read during transmission. However, these measures, standing alone, are not sufficient to ensure the security of your Personal Information. It is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your passwords and the unauthorized use of your computer.

* **CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS  
**

We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our Websites in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. The participant's contact information is also used to contact him or her when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions. 

* **PRIVACY STATEMENT COMPLIANCE**

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations governing the collection and use of Personal Information. From time to time, Fold3 will review its Personal Information collection, use, and disclosure practices in order to assure that we are complying with our Privacy Statement and all applicable laws and regulations. 

Your use of the Fold3 Website and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Service. If you have any concerns about the privacy or security of your Personal Information, please contact us at support@fold3.com. We will attempt to resolve your inquiry in a timely manner.

* **WE RETAIN THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THIS STATEMENT  **

From time to time, we may make changes to this Statement. If we make changes, we will post the new Privacy Statement on this page and indicate clearly the effective date of this Privacy Statement and the date on which this Privacy Statement was last updated.

* **EFFECTIVE DATES**

This Privacy Statement is effective immediately for all new Users on or after August 18, 2011 and as of September 19, 2011 for all Users already registered or a paying Member to the Website prior to August 18, 2011.
