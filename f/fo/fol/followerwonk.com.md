# Follower Wonk: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

We keep your information confidential, except for limited circumstances where we share that information with third-parties to better service you, or as required by law.

Indeed, when you use Follower Wonk, we may collect personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, billing address, your IP address, credit card or other payment information, pages visited on our site, your Twitter OAuth login details, and details about your Twitter account.

We use cookies to maintain session state for each page you visit. We use third-party cookies, such as Google Analytics, to anonymously track visits to our site to better optimize the overall site experience.

We use Twitter OAuth as the exclusive means to create an account and login to that account on Follower Wonk. This is a good thing: it means that your Twitter username and password are not stored on our servers. As well, you do not need to maintain a separate username and password to access our service.

We may ask for your email address: when we do, we will send you a confirmation email to verify that you indeed requested to add your email address to our system. Save for subsequent confirmation emails, if you do not opt-in via said confirmation email, you won't hear from us again. As well, each outgoing email we send you will include a clear opt-out link at the bottom of the message. If you choose to opt-out of promotional, system alert, account notices, or any other type of email that we send in a bulk or automated fashion, you shall not receive emails of that type again. Except for third-parties that we may use to send you email and ensure deliverability of said email, we shall not share your email address with others.

Since we are a Twitter-based application, we may perform certain Twitter actions on your behalf. These actions may include tweeting, following, unfollowing, and more. We will not perform these actions on your behalf unless you explicitly grant us permission to do so. Said permission may be in the form of clicking on a button, leaving checkboxes checked, checking checkboxes, or other non-surprising form submissions.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please email us at support(at)followerwonk.com
