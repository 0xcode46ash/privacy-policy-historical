### Last Updated 01-06-2014

Folica, Inc. ("Folica") owns and operates this web site, Folica.com ("Web Site"). Folica recognizes and respects the importance of maintaining the privacy of our customers, registered members ("Members") and users, and has established this Privacy Policy as a result. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of: the personal information we may collect from you when you visit our Web Site, respond to our emails, place orders via mail or fax, or otherwise contact us via telephone, email, fax or mail.

Note: You must be 18 years or older to use, subscribe or register as a member of Folica.com. The Web Site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect, maintain or disclose personal information from or about children under the age of 13. If Folica becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information and terminate the respective account.

### Why do we gather information?

Folica.com gathers personal information to help improve our products and customer service, to communicate with you, to process your orders, to provide you with an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience, and to inform you of special offers and discounts from us and selected third parties.

### What information do we gather?

We collect information through our Web Site, emails, mail, fax, and telephone, including when you:

  * place an order,
  * participate in our forums, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, and membership registrations, and
  * engage in other activities, services, products and resources we make accessible to our customers, members or users.



Depending on how you interact with us, we collect some or all of the following types of information:

  * your name, address, telephone number, email address,
  * billing information (credit/debit card number, expiration date, alternate or additional billing information and billing address),
  * gender and birth date, if you choose, or are otherwise required to, enter such information,
  * products purchased

  * other information you provide to us.

Information you provide may be collected by us even if an order, registration, or other process is started but not completed or otherwise cancelled. Members may also add to their Address Book the name, address and telephone number of friends or other persons to whom they may wish to send orders. Other Members do not have the right to view and edit your Address Book entries.

Upon completing a purchase with Folica, a customer is automatically opted in for e-mails. To opt out, please e-mail: unsubscribe@folica.com.

When you use the Ratings & Reviews or the Question & Answer services you will become a registered user (if you arenâ€™t already one) and any personal information you submit will become part of your profile, as maintained by Folica.

### Social Media

Folica invites you to socialize and share your hair care finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Folica com. Folica does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. For more information about Facebook Social Plugins and other social media tools, click this [link](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/). 

We may allow you to sign in to your Folica.com account using your social media account. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within your account allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from Folica.com . Folica.com will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with terms and conditions regarding use of your social media profile information. 

### How we use "Cookies" and "Action Tags".

A "cookie" is a small data file sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer, user or Member and to provide certain features to you. Most web browsers allow you to instruct the browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of Folica.com Web Site, such as the cart, may not function properly.

We have relationships with third parties who may receive non-personal information directly from the cookies placed by our Web Site on your computer to assist in analyzing our business and customers.

Our Web Site also uses a common web technology called "action tags" (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to anonymously track purchase, usage and other web activity information. Action tags (including third party tags) may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. However, our Web Site does not currently use action tags to collect or transfer personal information.

### Interest-based advertising

### Other websites

Advertisements for our products and services may appear on third party websites around the Internet. Some websites and services deliver these advertisements based upon data that has been previously collected about your past behavior online. For example, if you have viewed websites about hair care, these websites or services may display to you an advertisement for our hair care products. This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. It is generally not based upon your personal information, but rather, upon your online activities.

We do not control such third party websites or services on which these advertisements appear. Further, we do not control how they collect and use data about your online activities. However, you may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process.

### Our Web Site

In addition, from time-to-time, our Web Site may also carry advertisements from other companies. Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based, for example, on commercial interests you have expressed during your online activities. You may opt-out of receiving this type of targeted advertising by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp to learn more about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from interest-based advertising ads served by some or all participating companies. Once again, if you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out. This process relies upon an opt-out cookie, so if you delete your cookies or use a different computer, you will have to repeat this process.

### How we use the information we collect

We use information we collect to communicate with you, to process your orders, to provide you with an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience, to inform you and of offers and discounts from Folica.com, and to enable you to receive credits for purchases under loyalty or buying programs which you have joined. We may engage email and other service providers in connection with the foregoing, and you consent to having the information we collect transferred to them for that purpose. Our service providers have agreed to treat such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may make such information (except for credit/debit card number and expiration date, unless you consent otherwise), including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including, but not limited to, those who share or rent information for direct marketing purposes.

Otherwise, without your consent, we do not make your email addresses, available to "third parties" (as that term is defined and limited below). For example, we may make your postal address available to third parties for marketing purposes; however, we would not share your email address without your consent. In addition, you may instruct that other personal information about you to us not be shared with third parties by following the instructions in How to Limit the Use of Personal Information, below.

Our Affiliates, subcontractors, service providers and agents, and any successors or assignees to our business (if we ever sell, lease, license or assign some or all of our business), are not considered to be third parties under this Privacy Policy.

However, in connection with information collected under this Privacy Policy, they are required to comply with this Privacy Policy. "Affiliates" are persons or entities directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Folica.com

We may combine information we receive from you via our Web Site, emails, mail, fax, and telephone with information from our Affiliates and third parties. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us and to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to disclose information you provide to us as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests and as necessary or appropriate, in our view, to operate the Web Site, process orders or registrations, to conduct promotions, contests, and sweepstakes you participate in, and to protect the rights or property of the Company, its Affiliates, users, customers, recipients, Members, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, Merchants and Associates.

Please note that all information (including personal information) that you reveal or post on one of our public forums such as a message board, chat room, discussion group, folder, survey, contest, sweepstakes, user review and rate forum, and all User Submissions, are not protected by this Privacy Policy and may be collected, shared and used by us (and third parties) without restriction or your permission. Information you give out or post on our public forums is disclosed at your own risk.

Folica may also transfer any and all information it collects for the Web Site (including personal information, registration data, e-mail addresses, purchase histories, traffic data and information from public forums) to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets related to the Web Site.
