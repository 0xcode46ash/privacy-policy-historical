### SHARING OF INFORMATION

_Personally-Identifiable Information_ — We may share information among our various businesses and brands within The Folger Coffee Company and its subsidiaries. We may provide your personal information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill for goods. We use other third parties to provide promotions, contests, newsletters and hosting for our site. These service providers may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us. These service providers are not authorized to use, share, retain or store your personally-identifiable information for any other purpose. We may conduct joint promotions with other companies, and may share with these promotional partners (and their service providers) personally-identifiable information necessary to conduct the promotion. We may also use and disclose personally-identifiable information where we think it is necessary to investigate or prevent actual or expected fraud, or criminal activity or injury or damage to us or others, including when requested or required by law enforcement or government officials. We will not share personally-identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties. For California residents, please see Opting Out, below. 

_Aggregate Information (non-personally-identifiable)_ — We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers who perform services on our behalf. This information does not identify individual users. We do this for online data analysis and research purposes to help provide our users with relevant tool and features. We do not link aggregate user data with personally-identifiable information. 

### OPTING OUT
