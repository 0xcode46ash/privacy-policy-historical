# Privacy policy

To make your experience on this website and our email lists more convenient, we gather information from you. We maintain the privacy of your information using security technologies and adhere to policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information.

### What personal information do we collect, and how is it used?

We collect personal information from visitors when they register to join our organization, subscribe to a newsletter or email list, or take action on an issue using our service. The personal information we collect is always voluntarily submitted by you. This information is used by us to communicate with you in the future, and to understand your interests and activities. We keep confidential all personal information entered during registration. If you would like to review any personal information we have collected or request corrections, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about-us/contact "Contact Us").

If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from any or all of our email lists, you can unsubscribe by simply visiting the subscription management page on our website and clicking the unsubscribe button, or you can opt out of future emails by simply stating this desire in a reply to any email we send you.

We may also monitor and track information such as visitor usage patterns of our website. We compile this information into a statistical aggregate that we use for internal purposes including improving our web service and our client service.

### Protecting Your Privacy

As part of our commitment to ensuring the privacy of our visitors and email subscribers, we do not sell or exchange names or any other personally identifiable information about our online visitors and activists with, for example, mass marketers.

We may provide personal information to third parties on a completely confidential basis to enable such third parties to perform certain tasks, such as maintain a membership database or send email alerts and/or newsletters, on our behalf. These third party providers are committed to protecting the privacy of our members and subscribers, and will utilize your information only to provide the services for which we contract. We may share aggregate information about website usage and traffic patterns, stripped of any personally identifiable information, to third parties to comply with various reporting obligations and for business or marketing purposes.

### Data Security

The data we gather from our supporters is stored on servers at a third-party site, Salsa Labs. Salsa's servers utilize industry-standard methods to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information. Access to Friends of the Earthâ€™s data is restricted within the company, and all employees are aware that this data is private. If you have any further questions about privacy or security, please contact Salsa by sending an email to: info@salsalabs.com. You can also read its privacy policy [here](https://www.salsalabs.com/privacy-policy).

### Donor Privacy Policy

Friends of the Earth will never share donor giving information with other organizations. However, like many other groups, Friends of the Earth may exchange or rent its donor mailing list with like-minded organizations -- many of which we work with in our environmental advocacy work. If you do not want your name and address shared with other organizations, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about-us/contact "Contact Us") and we will remove you from any shared lists.

### Use of Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that are stored on your computer and that can be used to help identify you when you visit our website. We use cookies to make visiting and using our website easier -- first, so that you don't have to continually re-enter information and second, so that we can tailor your visit to your expressed preferences.

### Links to Other Sites

This website provides links to several other third party websites. While we make efforts to choose our links carefully, we cannot take any responsibility for the content of linked websites, or for the privacy policies of websites we link to. Our Take Action pages often provide links in order for you submit comments to federal agencies. Usually those agencies collect contact information and frequently they publish the contact information along with the comments submitted. Since we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party websites prior to any use.

### Privacy Policy Changes

We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. We maintain the option to change this Privacy Statement at any time by electronic notice posted on our website. Your continued use of our website after the date that such notices are posted will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
