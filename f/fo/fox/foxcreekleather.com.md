This privacy statement covers the site www.foxcreekleather.com.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact customer service at Fox Creek Leather by e-mail at [customerservice@foxcreekleather.com](mailto:%20customerservice@foxcreekleather.com) or by phone at 1-800-766-4165. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php> .

**Overview**

Fox Creek Leather will not spam you. Your personal information will not be used for any purpose other than to process your order. If requested we will add your e-mail address to our newsletter mailing list. We will never share, sell, or rent our mailing list.

**Personal Information**

When you place an order with us we will ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. You may choose to provide your credit card information to make a payment or you may send us a check, bank wire transfer, or pay via paypal instead. Your information will only be used to process your order and will be used for no other purpose.

**Shipping and Credit Card Processing**

We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by emailing customer service at [customerservice@foxcreekleather.com](mailto:customerservice@foxcreekleather.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use persistent cookies to enable shopping cart and to track Web site use. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may find more information about cookies at <http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/>.

**Clear Gifs**

Our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

**Choice/Opt-out**

We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your e-mail address added to our newsletter mailing list. When placing an order or recommending a product you can choose to uncheck the box requesting that your e-mail address be added to our mailing list. If you are a newsletter subscriber and no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at .

You will be notified if your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. All information entered throughout the checkout process is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Our SSL certificate is issued by [Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/). At no point in time do we transfer your information over a non encrypted connection.

Additional measures we take to secure your information include protecting our server by placing it behind a hardware firewall, partnering with [ScanAlert](http://www.scanalert.com/) to proactively monitor our Web site for security flaws, and a daily audit of our server for intrusion.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [customerservice@foxcreekleather.com](mailto:%20customerservice@foxcreekleather.com).

**Business Transitions**

In the event Fox Creek Leather goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
