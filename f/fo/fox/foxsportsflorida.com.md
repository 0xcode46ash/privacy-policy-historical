Third-parties that support the Fox Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content, purchase Site Products or post to the forums or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info/consumers.     ](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers.%20%20%20%20%20%5bAdd) 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through Fox Services.
