A "persistent" cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across site visits. Also, if you log in to your FoxyTunes account, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you visit the FoxyTunes Web site. 

Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that many features of the FoxyTunes Web site may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.

The FoxyTunes server records certain information it automatically receives from the browser, such as the Web request, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed and the order of those pages. This information is used to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make the site more useful and to customize the site and personalize its content for you. 

## Statistical information

By analyzing the Web site usage as explained above, we may compile certain statistical information, such as most popular music or most visited FoxyTunes pages. This aggregate statistical information is not linked to any personal information. We may share such non-personal statistical information with our partners. 

When you use the FoxyTunes product via a web browser or a plug-in, certain statistical information may be gathered about your usage of the product and used for diagnostic purposes and improving FoxyTunes.
