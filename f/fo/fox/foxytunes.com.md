# Privacy Policy - FoxyTunes

Your privacy is very important to us and we are strongly committed to protecting it. 

Our privacy policy is clear - we do not collect, sell or rent your personal information without your explicit permission. 

## Personal information

FoxyTunes does not collect personal information about you when you visit our Web site, use our Web services or our client applications, unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

In order to make your FoxyTunes experience more personal, you might choose to create a FoxyTunes account, in which case you will be asked to provide your email address. The email address will help you recover lost or forgotten passwords, and might be used to send periodic updates about FoxyTunes. We will never use your email to send spam and will always provide a clear way for you to opt out of receiving email messages. 

If you choose to share any personal information (such as your email address) with us, we will not share this information with third parties or other FoxyTunes users without your explicit permission, except when required by law, subpoena or court order. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser by a Web site. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating Web site when this visitor returns. 

FoxyTunes Web site uses cookies to help personalize your FoxyTunes experience. 

A "persistent" cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across site visits. Also, if you log in to your FoxyTunes account, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you visit the FoxyTunes Web site. 

Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that many features of the FoxyTunes Web site may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed. 

## Web Site Visits

Like most Web sites on the Internet, the FoxyTunes server records certain information it automatically receives from the browser, such as the Web request, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed and the order of those pages. This information is used to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make the site more useful and to customize the site and personalize its content for you. 

## Statistical information

By analyzing the Web site usage as explained above, we may compile certain statistical information, such as most popular music or most visited FoxyTunes pages. This aggregate statistical data cannot be not linked to any personal information. We may share such non-personal statistical information with our partners. 

## Third Party Web Sites

We may display links to 3rd party sites and some of our site pages (artist pages for example) display information from 3rd parties (such as Amazon, YouTube or Flickr). We cannot be held responsible for any 3rd party Web sites and accessing their content will be subject to their own privacy policies, which we advise you to check. 

## Changes

FoxyTunes may update this Privacy Policy from time to time - we encourage you to review it periodically. 

## Comments and Questions

If you have any comments or questions about our privacy policy please [contact us](http://www.foxytunes.com/feedback.html).
