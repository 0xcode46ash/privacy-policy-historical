# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us and we are strongly committed to protecting it. 

Our privacy policy is clear - we do not collect, sell or rent your personal information without your explicit permission. 

### Personal information

FoxyTunes does not collect personal information about you when you visit our Web site, use our Web services or our client applications, unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

If you choose to share any personal information with us, we will not share this information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, subpoena or court order. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor's browser by a Web site. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating Web site when this visitor returns. 

The FoxyTunes Web site may use cookies to provide a better interactive experience on certain portions of our Web site - without storing your personal information or compromising your privacy and security. 

Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent. Please note that some features of the FoxyTunes Web site may not function properly when cookies are disabled. 

### Web Site Visits

Like most Web sites on the Internet, the FoxyTunes site may collect non-personal information it automatically receives from the browser, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, language preference and referring site. This information is used to help diagnose problems with our servers and to make the site more useful for you. 

### Changes

FoxyTunes may update this Privacy Policy from time to time - we encourage you to review it periodically.
