FOXTEL also collects information regarding activity on its website, such as the number of visitors to the website, the date and time of those visits, the number of pages viewed and navigation patterns. This information does not personally identify you. It is obtained using 'cookies' which are frequently used by websites to identify users' computers.

This information is collected on FOXTEL's behalf by Red Sheriff, located at <http://www.redsheriff.com/>. 

**How we use your information**

We will disclose your personal information:

 **Direct marketing**

Unless you ask us not to, we will use your personal information to provide information to you about other goods or services which we or any of our Related Companies may offer to you.

Unless you ask us to tell them not to, our Related Companies, Suppliers, Authorised Providers and our Business Partners will use your personal information to provide information to you about goods and services they offer.

You can contact us at any time about this even if you have been our customer for some time and you had previously given us your consent.

 **Access**

We will provide you with access to most personal information that we have about you, but sometimes that will not be possible, in which case we will tell you why.  If you want to find out what information we have about you contact us on 131 999.  We will ask you to put your request for access in writing and provide proof of your identity.  You may be charged an administration fee when we provide you with the requested information to cover our time and postage and handling costs.

If you think that any personal information we hold about you is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, you may ask us to correct that information.  We will take reasonable steps to correct such personal information unless we disagree with you about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

 **Credit reporting**

The Privacy Act allows us to give a credit reporting agency certain personal information about you.  The information we disclose to a credit reporting agency includes:  
• permitted information which will allow you to be identified,  
• the fact that you have applied for credit and the amount,  
• the fact that we are a current credit provider to you;  
• payments that are more than 60 days overdue and for which debt collection action has started;  
• information that in our opinion you have committed a serious credit infringement (that is, acted fraudulently or shown an intention not to comply with your credit obligations); and  
• cheques drawn by you for $100 or more which have been dishonoured more than once.

 **If we report your default to a credit reporting agency your credit rating may be affected and you may have difficulty obtaining credit in the future.**

The section on Payments in [FOXTEL’s Residential Digital Subscription Agreement](http://www.foxtel.com.au/files/residentialagreement.pdf) tells you more about when we will be a credit provider to you.
