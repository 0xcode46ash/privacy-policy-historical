**_ Effective as of January 8, 2007_** ** **

** PRIVACY POLICY**

Fox Filmed Entertainment ( **"Fox FE"** ) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of _[ Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html)_ applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.  Fox FE has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ( **"PII"** ) we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.

_ Children's Privacy Policy_:

Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13.  In those instances, we provide additional privacy protections.  To read about our protections for children under 13[ click here](http://foxus.rsys1.net/servlet/website/ResponseForm?MQNlE1zwkpOHJRwhspJR#child#child).

From time to time Fox FE may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our web sites or industry initiatives.  Those revisions will be reflected in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy.  Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.  If Fox FE materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.

**1.     _COLLECTION \- COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FOX FE_ :**

(a) _General_ :  Fox FE collects personally identifiable information ( **"PII"** \-- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.  When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information.  We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.  

(b) _Cookies_ :  Cookies are small bits of information that the Fox FE web sites place on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and enable Fox FE to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable.  For example, cookies can store your password for easy log-on to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.  Information about your activities on Fox FE sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on Fox FE sites also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers.  Fox FE does not control these cookies and visitors to our web sites should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how it uses cookies. (See the “Notice” section below for more information on third party advertisements).

Fox FE may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party.  For example, if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on Fox FE’s web site(s) may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.  However, if Fox FE wishes to coordinate your personal and web site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.  

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.  However, without cookies you won't have access to certain features on Fox FE's web site(s), such as personalization of site content.

**2.     _NOTICE \- FOX FE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES_ :**

When you voluntarily provide PII to Fox FE, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Fox FE will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, Fox FE will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information, provided you have given Fox FE permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form.  Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

Fox FE's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.  Fox FE is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of a third party.  Once you've left a Fox FE site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

Fox FE's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Fox FE (i.e., that are part of the News America Group).  Although all News America Group entities adhere to the Group’s _[ Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html)_, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on Fox FE web sites are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as 24/7 Real Media, Inc.  These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites, including information about the banner ads they display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address.  To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit their web site at:

[ http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html](http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html) or

[ http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp)

**3.     _CHOICE \- FOX FE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII_ :**

Fox FE will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Fox FE (i.e., not a part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.

**4.     _USE \- FOX FE'S USE OF PII_ :**

Fox FE will use your PII provided under this Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.  If Fox FE obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy. 

Fox FE may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, part of the News America Group of companies.  Provided you have given us permission, Fox FE may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Fox FE, but would like to send you information about their products and services.  However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties at the time of collection. 

Fox FE employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.  Fox Fe may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use PII to provide Fox FE with a specific service and not for any other purpose.  Fox FE uses a third party vendor to distribute e-mails and to collect and store consumer registration information. [ Click Here](http://www.rsvp0.net/) to see the vendor's Services Permission Policy. 

There may be instances when Fox FE may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Fox FE, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Fox FE sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Fox FE may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

Fox FE may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Fox FE to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our web sites.  Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our _s_ ites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished.  These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose.  Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Fox FE's advertisers and business partners.

**5.     _SECURITY \- FOX FE PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_ :**

Fox FE uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  In addition, Fox FE uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.  Passwords and other sensitive information stored by Fox FE are encrypted both in transit and when stored within Fox FE’s online databases.

**6.     _ACCESS \- HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII_ :**

Visitors may review or delete personal information from our records.  If you would like to review your personal information in our records, or change any PII or user preferences  previously submitted, please go to[ Member Center](http://foxus.rsys1.net/servlet/website/ResponseForm?MQNlEyLjNLlmf9epgr.40hkt).  If you would like your personal information deleted, please contact us at _feedbackus@fox.com_.  We will delete your information from our database.  However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain PII.  This residual information will not be given to any other third party or used for any commercial purpose.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY**

[ http://foxus.rsys1.net/servlet/website/child](http://foxus.rsys1.net/servlet/website/child)

 1.    ** _KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY_ :**

Fox Filmed Entertainment ( **"Fox FE"** ) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of _Privacy Principles_ applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.  Fox FE has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ( **"PII"** ) we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.

We at Fox FE understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards and other forms of interactivity.  Fox FE also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information collected from children at the Foxmovies.com website ( **"Site"** ).  Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ( **"COPPA"** ).  Fox FE encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible.  However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on the Internet.  That's why Fox FE has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their children and kids will find informative, educational and fun!  Because there's always room for improvement, Fox FE welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place to visit.

**2.     _COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13_ :**

When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Fox FE does not require the disclosure of more PII than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation.

Fox FE may use different types of PII submitted to this Site by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below.  In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.

**(a)     _Use of a Child's Information by Fox FE_ :**

**(i)     We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a sweepstakes winner).  This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over.  Parental consent is obtained before we send the winner a prize.**

**(ii)     We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request.  For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from Fox FE.  In these instances Fox FE will also obtain a parent's email address along with the child's.  Before any further contact with the child, Fox FE will send an email to the parent (A) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc.; (B) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (C) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within one (1) week, Fox FE may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted.  Under no circumstances will the child be allowed to participate without giving a parent's email address.**

**(iii)     We may collect a child's PII (including name, email address, mailing address and phone number) for such activities as chats, forums, surveys, games, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional information.  In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the email address of the child's parent.  Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (A) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's PII and need the parent's consent to do so, and (B) provides the parent with a link to access this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA.  Fox FE will ask the parent to provide consent by return email.  Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email.  Fox FE will only use the child's PII for internal purposes and will not share it with any third party.**

**(iv)     We may collect a child's name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect against liability or as required or permitted by law.  Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose.**

**(b)     _Sharing Children's Personal Information with Third Parties_ :  Parents must affirmatively consent to the disclosure of their child's PII to any third party, including Fox-affiliated companies that are not part of Fox FE.  Parents may consent to Fox FE's collection and use of a child's PII without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.  **

**3.     _LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES_ :**

This Site may link directly to sites operated by Fox FE's advertisers, business partners and affiliated companies.  Those sites, which are not controlled by Fox FE, may collect PII from your child.  Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses children's PII.  Fox FE will not receive any personal information obtained by another site from a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA.

**4.     _REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PII COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER  13_:**

Parents of children under age 13 may review or delete personal information about their children from our records at any time.  If you would like your child's personal information deleted, please contact us at _[ feedbackus@fox.com](mailto:feedbackus@fox.com)_.  We will delete your child's information from our database if you so request.

If you would like to review the personal information in our records submitted by your child, or change any PII previously submitted by your child, please go to[ Member Center](http://foxus.rsys1.net/servlet/website/ResponseForm?MQNlEyLjNLlmf9epgr.40hkt) and follow the instructions.
