Your privacy is important to Vividas USA, Inc. The privacy policy set forth herein (the Vividas Privacy Policy) explains how Vividas treats Personal Information that Vividas collects and receives, including Personal Information related to your use of the Vividas Service. This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information collected or submitted through the Vividas website, e-mail communications between you and Vividas or other means. This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 17, 2007.

For purposes of the Terms, including this Privacy Policy, the term ÓPersonal InformationÓ means information about an individual that is personally identifiable and not publicly available, such as one's name, contact details, and credit card information, as well as the products and Service in which one expresses an interest and/or which one purchases. 

Collection of Personal Information

In order to create an account with Vividas and/or order and access the Service, you are required to provide certain Personal Information requested by the online registration feature, ordering feature and/or other pages or functions within the Service. This information may include your legal name, personal address, personal phone number, personal e-mail address, subscriber name or "screen name" and password used to access the Service. Vividas reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of any of the materials, goods or services available in connection with the Service.  Once a user name is created for you, Vividas stores such information in order to enable you to use the Service and to customize your experience. 

If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you will not be able to register with Vividas, use or subscribe to the Service, make any purchases or other transactions through the Service, or obtain other services or benefits that require such disclosure.

Vividas receives and stores information on its website.  When the registration and order form asks for sensitive Personal Information, Vividas works to protect your information during transmission with information encryption software, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 

Use of Personal Information

Except as set forth herein, Vividas shall not provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals without your permission, unless required by law or for other legal purposes consistent with the Vividas Privacy Policy. VividasÕ third party service providers have access to this information to process credit card payments but may not use it for other purposes. Vividas shall make best efforts to ensure that these third party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on VividasÕs behalf. 

Some of the Personal Information provided by you will be shared with Fox Soccer ChannelÑsuch as name, address, email and other information from the registration process, but Vividas will not release full credit card details to further protect consumers.

Vividas will not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information to any unrelated third party. Vividas may use your Personal Information for the following purposes: 

· To verify your user status, including, without limitation, by confirming that you are a Vividas subscriber, that you have paid for particular content that requires payment or that you satisfy other conditions concerning particular content (e.g., geographic or time restrictions); 

· To process your transactions, including, without limitation, for billing purposes and for delivery of the Service to you; 

· To provide to third party subcontractors only that Personal Information necessary to process payment, deliver goods or services to you or to perform any other service related to your access to or use of the Service.

· To confirm your subscription to or cancellation from the Service, or any particular purchases or licenses offered through the Service;

Security and Confidentiality of Personal Information 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of Personal Information, Vividas has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures which Vividas regards as appropriate to safeguard and secure the Personal Information Vividas collects online. 

Vividas uses encryption technology to protect the security of the information collected and transmitted through its website and the Service. When Vividas' registration and order forms ask users to enter sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and transmitted to a secure database server using Secured Socket Layer encryption technology. 

In addition, your Vividas Account Information is password-protected for your protection.  After a successful login, you can change your password at your discretion. Vividas recommends that you choose a password that would be difficult to guess, that you change your password periodically and that you keep your password secret (including by not allowing friends or family members to use your account and password). You acknowledge that you are responsible for selecting a password and maintaining its secrecy. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL VIVIDAS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR YOUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE SECRECY OF YOUR PASSWORD.

No information should be submitted to Vividas or through the Service by children under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. Vividas does not allow children under 13 to open an account or to receive direct marketing communications arising from their use of the Service and, therefore, Vividas does not provide any personally identifiable information from children under 13 to any third party.
