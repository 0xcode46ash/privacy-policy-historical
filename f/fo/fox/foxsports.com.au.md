# Privacy Policy | National & World Sports News & Video | Fox Sports

**FOX SPORTS Australia Pty Limited** (FOX SPORTS) is the owner and operator of [www.foxsports.com.au](http://www.foxsports.com.au/) (FOX SPORTS Website) and various FOX SPORTS applications (APPS).  FOX SPORTS recognises the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to the FOX SPORTS Website, users of FOX SPORTS APPS and persons who utilise various services on the FOX SPORTS Website and APPS such as fantasy and tipping competitions. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the words ‘customers’, ‘you’ and ‘your’ include visitors to, subscribers to and users of the FOX SPORTS Website, APPS and their various services and references to 'we', 'our' or 'us' include FOX SPORTS.

We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in relation to the handling of personal information. Where appropriate we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption (but complying with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards), related bodies corporate exemption and the employee exemption in the Privacy Act.

**Personal Information**

We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we will tell you why we are collecting information and how we plan to use it at the time of collecting it, or these things will be obvious when we collect the information. We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.

**Use of Information**

We usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it. We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication. We may also use your demographic information (e.g. age, gender and state) to personalise the content and advertisements that we show you. 

We may share your information with other companies which are related to us, within Australia. We or they may also use your personally identifiable information to assist us in improving our products and services and any of us might be in touch to let you know about goods, services, or promotions which may interest you.

**Use by Third Parties**

When you access certain features of APPs (such as “checking in” to a venue), certain information about you (such as your username and profile photo) may be shared with other users of the APPs. Facebook’s privacy policy and terms of use apply to your use of Facebook. 

  
We may disclose your information to our service providers and contractors from time to time to help us to provide and market our goods and services to you (by way of example, our fantasy and tipping competitions), some of which may be located outside of Australia. FOX SPORTS has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred outside of Australia will not be held, used or disclosed by the overseas service provider inconsistently with the National Privacy Principles. We may also share your information with third parties who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers. If we do this we generally require these parties to protect your information in the same way we do.

**Use of Aggregate Data**

We may collect certain non-personal information to optimise our goods and services including our web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites.

We may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services including our websites and make them more responsive to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by FOX SPORTS or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

**Security**

FOX SPORTS strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information of our customers. FOX SPORTS uses a variety of physical and electronic security measures including restricting physical access to our offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or unauthorised use or disclosure.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure.

FOX SPORTS requires at least the same security, integrity and privacy measures of third parties that may require access to your personal information as part of you visiting or in providing the various services available on the FOX SPORTS Website.

**Access to Personal Information**

You have a right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we deny access in some circumstances we will tell you why. To request access, please contact our privacy officers as set out at the end of this document.

**Public Information**

Any information posted on bulletin boards, blogs and/or communicated in chat areas or any other areas of the FOX SPORTS Website become public information. While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in such areas.

**Cookies**

Cookies are data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions or registered services.

**Online Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites**

We may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to the FOX SPORTS Website to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. Please ensure you read the privacy policy relating to those sites.

We are not responsible for the content or practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by us of the content, policies or practices of those third party sites. Once you have left the FOX SPORTS Website via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.

**What else you should know about privacy on the Internet**

Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet, remember that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet.

**For further information**

Please contact FOX SPORTS via mail or email as set out below to ask for access to your information, if you have a complaint concerning your personal information including questions regarding SPAM or if you would like more information about our approach to privacy.
