**MyFOXDC.com’s Privacy Policy  
Effective as of November 4, 2010**

MyFOXDC operates the Internet web site located at MyFoxDC.com (the “MyFoxDC Web site” or the “Site”). MyFOXDC is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles available at [ **http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html**](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. MyFoxDC has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) such as your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or credit card number we obtain from users of our Site. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by MyFoxDC, including the Site, FoxHiLites, the MyFoxDC mobile services and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by MyFoxDC in connection with the Site (collectively, the “Services”).

The MyFoxDC Web site is a general audience site and MyFoxDC does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

From time to time MyFoxDC may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Services, or technology. Your continued use of the Services after MyFoxDC posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If MyFoxDC materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY MYFOX DC

General. When MyFoxDC collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the PII to us in order to register for the MyFoxDC Web site. MyFoxDC may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in MyFoxDC’s activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, and surveys or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to MyFoxDC for review. Registration PII required includes email address along with screen name and password. Other information including birth date, gender, country and zip code are optional. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

In addition, MyFoxDC collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the Services, track usage, and for security and monitoring purposes.

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that MyFoxDC places on your computer. MyFoxDC uses the cookies to identify your Internet browser, store users’ preferences, and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Services.

Third-party advertisements displayed on the Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. MyFoxDC does not control these cookies and users of the Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section below for more information on third party advertising.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Services

NOTICE: MYFOXDC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to MyFoxDC, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses MyFoxDC will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, MyFoxDC will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, MyFoxDC will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given MyFoxDC permission to do so (See “Use” below).

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us.

The Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third- party sites may be co-branded with the MyFoxDC logo or an affiliated entity, even though they are not operated or maintained by MyFoxDC (for example, co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). The MyFoxDC Web site may also carry advertisements from other companies. MyFoxDC is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Services or for the privacy practices of third parties or Internet advertising companies. Once you’ve left the Services via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

The Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with MyFoxDC (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group’s Privacy Principles located at http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on MyFoxDC are delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to or use of our Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

CHOICE: MYFOXDC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, MyFoxDC will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with MyFoxDC (i.e., not part of the News America Group), without your permission.

USE: MYFOX DC’S USE OF PII

MyFoxDC will only use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If MyFoxDC obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy.

If you have consented to receive promotional materials from MyFoxDC, MyFoxDC may periodically use your email address to send you notifications related to the Services. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from MyFoxDC, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each promotional email.

MyFoxDC may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, MyFoxDC may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with MyFoxDC, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, some of the companies who supply prizes for MyFoxDC’s contests may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to users of the MyFoxDC Web site. We will not share your PII with third parties without your permission.

We will not share your credit card information with third parties except those MyFoxDC uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through MyFoxDC. MyFoxDC employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. MyFoxDC may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., message boards, sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contest, promotions, and sweepstakes. These outside contractors, agents, or sponsors may only use your PII to provide MyFoxDC with a specific service and not for any other purpose without your consent. MyFoxDC may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII.

As described in the “Notice” section above, MyFoxDC may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. MyFoxDC prohibits these companies from sharing your information with any third party or from using it for any purpose other than targeting advertising.

MyFoxDC may aggregate PII and use it anonymously. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by web beacons, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with MyFoxDC’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when MyFoxDC may access or disclose any data or content provided by you (including, without limitation, PII and non-PII) without providing you with a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights of MyFoxDC, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if MyFoxDC sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, MyFoxDC may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY: MYFOXDC PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

MyFoxDC uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII and credit card information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, MyFoxDC uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
