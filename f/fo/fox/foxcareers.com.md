#### Activity Information Collection: Cookies and Similar Technologies

When you access and interact with the Careers Site, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Careers Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Careers Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other transactional information for that device. Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. Our websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Careers Site, such as pages you have visited. 

Third parties that support the Careers Site by providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Careers Site or third-party services. Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Careers Site. 

**Do Not Track Signals.** At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted. 

#### Access and Correction

If you register on the Careers Site, you may access, review, and change your personal information stored therein by logging into the Careers Site and updating your account information. Please note that if you change or correct information after submitting it through the Careers Site, such changes will be visible to Fox. The updated profile will be used as the default the next time you apply for a job using your account online. To change personal information that you have already submitted for consideration for a specific position, please update your profile. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. 

Apart from information contained in your profile, you may request access to personal information we collect, or its modification or suppression, where permitted by applicable law. Please contact us by email or mail using the details in the _“Contact Us”_ section below with any such requests. In your request, please make clear what personal information you would like to access or have changed, whether you would like to have personal information that you have provided to us suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that certain personal information may be exempt from such access, correction, or suppression rights pursuant to local data protection laws. 

#### Security

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below. 

Do not send sensitive information to us via email. It is your sole responsibility to use the appropriate level of care whenever you communicate with us. 

Fox hereby disclaims, as far as permitted by local laws, any liability for itself and its affiliates and contractors for any personal information we collect in connection with your application that is lost, misused, illegally accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed or not timely delivered to our Careers Site. 

#### Links to Third-Party Websites

The Careers Site may contain links to other websites. This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Careers Site links.
