## Who is responsible for your personal information?

The Careers Sites allow you to apply for jobs at Fox worldwide, as a benefit of Fox’s global recruitment function. This means that personal information you submit to Fox will be used by Fox’s global recruitment functions located in the United States, as well as by Fox affiliates across the world, depending on the position you apply for. Therefore, this Statement refers to the collection and use of your personal data performed by **Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Fox Entertainment Group, LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, and Fox Networks Group, with offices at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036 and 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Los Angeles, California, 90067 (in their capacity as “joint controllers”) -** where Fox’s global recruiting function resides and from where Career Sites are managed - as well as by **any other relevant Fox affiliate, that may need to access the information, depending on the position you are applying for. The complete list of Fox affiliates** that may process your information in their capacity of data controllers is available [here](http://www.21cf.com/). As a potential employer, the relevant Fox affiliate will handle your personal information in accordance with this Statement. Any subsequent hiring or other employment-related decisions will be made by the Fox hiring affiliate in accordance with the laws of the country where the job will be located and a separate employee privacy policy will be provided, if required by applicable data protection law. 

For any information regarding this Statement and the use of your personal information by Fox (including any relevant Fox affiliate), you may contact us at [FoxCareersPrivacy@fox.com](mailto:FoxCareersPrivacy@fox.com). 

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

We may collect the following information from you in connection with your application:

  * Name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other contact information;
  * Username and password;
  * Work authorization status;
  * CV, résumé, cover letter, previous work experience and education information;
  * Skills;
  * Professional and other work-related licenses, permits and certifications held;
  * Information relating to references;
  * Any other information you elect to provide to us (e.g., employment preferences, willingness to relocate, desired salary, awards or professional memberships).



Any information you submit through the Careers Sites must be true, complete and not misleading. Submitting inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information may lead to a rejection of your application during the application process or disciplinary action including immediate termination of employment. In addition, it is your responsibility to ensure that information you submit does not violate any third party’s rights. 

If you provide us with personal information of a reference or any other individual as part of your application, it is your responsibility to obtain consent from that individual prior to providing the information to us. 

### Information from Other Sources

Fox may obtain information about you from other sources, such as from your references in connection with your application, as permitted by applicable law, or other information such as background checks, as permitted by applicable law. 

### SENSITIVE INFORMATION

**Please do not submit any information that could be considered “sensitive personal data.”** Sensitive personal data includes personal data regarding your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature; whether you are a member of a trade union; data regarding your physical or mental health or condition; your sexual orientation; and data regarding the commission or alleged commission of any criminal offense. 

Only for certain limited positions and/or in selected jurisdictions, you may be asked to provide certain sensitive personal data, such as identification of veteran status or information relating to convictions of a criminal offense, to the extent provided and authorized by the applicable law. 

## Use of Information

The information that you submit on the Careers Sites will be used **to consider your application for the specific position you applied for** and in particular to: (a) process your application; (b) to assess your capabilities and qualifications for a job; and (c) to respond to your inquiries and communicate with you about your application. 

If we hire you, personal information we collect in connection with your application also may be used to pre-populate some fields in our human resources system. Any such information may become part of your employee file and will be subject to Fox's privacy statement for employees, if required under applicable data protection laws. You will be allowed to amend this information at any time. 

We will use your information as permitted by local law, **to protect our rights** including to: (a) enforce this Statement; (b) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (c) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. 

Where required, we will use such information to: 

  * **comply with or monitor compliance with any applicable law or regulation; and to**
  * **respond to requests from public and government authorities,** including public and government authorities outside your country of residence. 



Providing personal information to us through the Careers Sites is necessary for us to fulfill all of the purposes listed above. If you fail to provide sufficient information, Fox may be unable to consider your employment application. 

Please note, that your personal information also will be **used for Fox’s global personnel recruiting function, should your profile be suitable for positions other than the one for which you applied.** In such case, the information about you will be added to Fox’s international candidate database and may be used to consider you for opportunities at Fox and its affiliates other than the one(s) for which you applied. Such additional processing will be carried out with your consent, if such consent is required by applicable law, or on the basis of Fox’s legitimate interest in maintaining applicants’ records to facilitate recruiting within its global operations; such legitimate interest is adequately balanced with your interest in being considered for other positions that may suit and interest you. If you no longer wish to be considered for other positions within Fox, contact us by email or mail using the details in the “Contact Us” section below. In particular, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can withdraw your consent or object at any time to this activity as described in the “Your Rights under GDPR” section of this Statement. 

Finally, your personal data may be used by Fox to complete a corporate transaction, such as a proposed or actual reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Fox businesses, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). Such activity also is performed on the basis of the legitimate interest of Fox and its possible counterparties to perform such economic activities (corporate transactions). That interest is adequately balanced with your interest, since the data processing is performed within the limits strictly necessary to perform such economic activities. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, this data processing activity is not mandatory and you can object at any time, as described in the section of this Statement titled “Your Rights under GDPR”. 

##  Disclosure of Personal Information 

Fox may share personal information with its **Fox affiliates** that are involved in evaluating candidates for a given position. Fox will make the information available to personnel with a business need to know the information, including personnel in the recruiting, human resources and information technology departments, and in the department responsible for the position(s) for which you are applying or for which you are being considered. The complete list of Fox affiliates is available [ here](http://21cf.com/). 

Fox may share personal information with **our third-party service providers,** who provide services such as hosting and operating the Careers Sites, recruiting assistance, background checks, processing and similar services. Such third party service providers and professional advisors may process personal information if they have a written contract with Fox and are expected to comply with applicable data protection law and to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information. 

To the extent necessary, Fox may transfer your personal information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our businesses, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). 

## Data Retention

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Statement and in accordance with our records retention policies, which is currently **three years** for the EEA countries. After this period, your personal information will be deleted from our systems, except for: (i) longer periods where the retention of information is necessary due to litigation or other legal proceedings, requests from competent government authorities, or in compliance with applicable laws; or (ii) shorter periods where required by applicable law.

## Data Transfers and Applicable Job Application Law

The Careers Sites allow you to apply for jobs at Fox world-wide, as a benefit of Fox’s global recruitment function. This means that personal information you submit to Fox may be available to Fox personnel and departments located in other countries. The Careers Sites are hosted in the United States. Fox uses third party service providers in connection with the Career Sites. Accordingly, you acknowledge that any personal information you submit to us through the Careers Sites will be transferred to the United States and other countries in or outside the European Economic Area. The level of protection of personal data in these countries may be different from the protection offered in the country where you reside. Please note that we have adopted appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information regardless of where it resides, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, in case of personal data referring to residents of the European Economic Area. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have the right at any time to request a copy of such safeguards, according to the “Your rights under GDPR” section below.

  * b) request the deletion, anonymization or restriction of the processing of your personal data processed in breach of the applicable law; 
  * c) request that Fox limit the processing of your personal data where:

  * d) withdraw your consent to the processing of personal data, if such processing is based on your consent; 
  * e) object to the processing of your personal data, when the processing is based on the legitimate interest of Fox. Upon your objection, Fox shall no longer process the personal data unless Fox demonstrates (i) compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or (ii) that the processing of the data is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; 
  * f) restrict Fox’s processing of your personal data when that processing is based on Fox’s legitimate interests and where you have objected to the processing on those grounds pending verification as to whether Fox has compelling legitimate grounds to continue the processing; 
  * g) request the erasure of your personal data without undue delay; 
  * h) “data portability”, namely to receive an electronic copy of your personal data that you have provided to us when (i) that data is being processed by automatic means, and (ii) the processing is either based upon your consent or necessary for the performance of a contract with you;
