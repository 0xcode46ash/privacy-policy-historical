**Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC Privacy Policy  
Effective as of January 28, 2009** _  
_  
Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC. ("FSIM") operates, and Fox Interactive Media ("FIM") owns, the Internet Web site located at [www.foxsports.com](http://www.foxsports.com/) (the "FSIM Web Site" or the "Site"). FSIM is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles available at <http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html> applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. FSIM has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII"-- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or credit card number) we obtain from users of our Site. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by FSIM, including the FSIM Web site, the FSIM mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by FSIM in connection with the FSIM Web site (collectively, the "Services").

The FSIM Web Site is a general audience site, and FSIM does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

From time to time FSIM may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Services, or technology. Your continued use of the Services after FSIM posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If FSIM materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change. 

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY FSIM. 

General. When FSIM collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the PII to us in order to register for the FSIM Web site. FSIM may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in FSIM's activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, and surveys, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to FSIM for review. Required registration PII includes first name, last name, email address, screen name, country, zip and date of birth. Phone number and mailing address are optional ** _._ **We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 

In addition, FSIM collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the Services, track usage, and for security and monitoring purposes. 

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that FSIM places on your computer. FSIM uses the cookies to identify your Internet browser, store users' preferences, and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Services. 

Third party advertisements displayed on the Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. FSIM does not control these cookies and users of the Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertising. FSIM may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Site to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the FSIM Web site may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if FSIM wishes to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent ****

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies, or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Services.

NOTICE: FSIM WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES 

When you voluntarily provide PII to FSIM, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FSIM will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, FSIM will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII. (See "Choice" below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, FSIM will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given FSIM permission to do so. (See "Use" below). 

The Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with the FSIM logo or an affiliated entity, even though they are not operated or maintained by FSIM (for example, co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). The Site may also carry advertisements from other companies. FSIM is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Services or for the privacy practices of third parties or Internet advertising companies. Once you've left the Services via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

The Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with FSIM (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's Privacy Principles located at http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on the Site are delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to or use of our Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address.

CHOICE: FSIM WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII 

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, FSIM will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with FSIM (i.e., not part of the News America Group) without your permission. 

USE: FSIM'S USE OF PII 

FSIM will only use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If FSIM obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy.

These outside contractors may only use your PII to provide FSIM with a specific service and not for any other purpose without your consent.

As described in the "Notice" section above, FSIM may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. FSIM prohibits these companies from sharing your information with any third party or from using it for any other purpose other than targeting advertising on the Site.

FSIM may aggregate PII and use it anonymously. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by web beacons, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with FSIM's advertisers and business partners. 

There may be instances when FSIM may access or disclose PII or non-PII without providing you with a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights of FSIM, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the Services or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if FSIM sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FSIM may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

SECURITY: FSIM PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII 

FSIM uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.
