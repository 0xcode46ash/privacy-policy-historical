Greetings from Focus on the Family and welcome to our site! We extend the following information to assure you, our guest, that we are concerned about and respect your privacy while visiting our Web site. Focus on the Family will never sell, lease or rent your confidential information. We will always endeavor to take steps to assure that any information you provide to us will remain secure. We want you to feel safe in your online experience while visiting our site. We, therefore, request that you take a moment to review the following valuable information.

**Collection of Information**  
Focus on the Family does not collect personal information without your knowledge during your visit to our Web sites.

However, Focus on the Family does at times ask that you provide us with personal information while online. The type of information we collect typically, but not always, corresponds directly with the service you request. For instance, you can make donations, when requested you can offer your thoughts, opinions, prayers, concerns, ideas, personal experiences, questions and/or suggestions to our resources, contests, or radio broadcasts, or you can request that a resource be sent to you directly from our Online Resource Center. As a visitor, the personal information you provide may also be used to improve the useability of, and information available on, our sites. In other words, at times we will ask you for more information, beyond just your name and contact information, than is needed to facilitate our response to your specific request. Your provision of such additional information is your acknowledgement that you consent to our use of such information to better serve you, our visitor, and others coming to our sites. As always, your name and address will never be shared with third parties. We also have a [**_Privacy Policy for Children_**](http://www.whitsend.org/library/privacy.cfm) that parents may be interested in reviewing.

You are able to see when the SSL encryption is active either by the "padlock" icon at the bottom of your browser's window or by a blue line around the window. In certain areas, password protection is used to protect your privacy and security.
