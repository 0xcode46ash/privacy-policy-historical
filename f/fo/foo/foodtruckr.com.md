2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES

2.1. WHAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY

COLLECT?

(a) CATEGORIES OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. We may

collect personally identifiable information from you in one of two manners. The first is if

you provide us with your name and email address while signing up for the free eBooks

to receive email communications from us. The second is if you write a comment to a

post and list your name, email address and domain.

privacy policy, we will post a notice on the Site. You will have 30 days from the posting

to consider whether you wish to continue accessing and using the Site pursuant to the

updates to the policy. The modifications or updates will not be effective until the 30 day

period has passed. After 30 days, your continued use of the Site shall act as an

affirmative acceptance of the new privacy policy, with the updates and modifications

becoming binding upon you.

(c) MODIFICATION OR REMOVAL PROCESS. If you wish to remove or modify any

(g) California Eraser Law. We comply with the California Eraser Law. If you are under

18 and wish to remove anything you have uploaded to the website, please contact us

using the contact function on FoodTruckr.com. Please note the removal of content does

not mean that it can’t be found elsewhere on the web. Archive sites and search engines,

for example, may have copies of the content.

2.2. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?

(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain

names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). No

personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather

anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful

for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.

(b) COOKIES. From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major

browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer

about your visit to our Site. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Site are useful and

which areas need improvement.

(c) SPONSORS AND ADVERTISERS. We may decide to accept sponsorship and

advertisements on the Site. Should this occur, you should assume said sponsors and

advertisers will be given access to the impressions and click data on their marketing

pieces. Your personally identifiable information will not be revealed.

3\. USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

(a) PERSONAL INFORMATION. We will not share your personal information with any

third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services

offered by us or to comply with the law. Your personally identifiable information is not

given to third parties that will market to you.

(b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to analyze our

Site traffic. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose

problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to

your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business

partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.

(c) USE OF COOKIES. We may use cookies to gather information on where you

move about the Site. The purpose of this is to analyze how the Site is performing and

the type of information visitors prefer and do not prefer. We do not use cookies for the

purpose personalizing our own advertising to you or to allow third party advertisers and

partners to do so.

(d) DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may disclose personal

information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is

necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on

Company or its parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the

rights or property of Company or the users of the Site, or (3) act under exigent

circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site.

(e) SALE OF INFORMATION. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we

may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the

information collected through this Site. If Company or substantially all of its assets are

acquired by a third party, your personally identifiable information will be one of the

assets transferred to the acquirer.

(f) DMCA CLAIM DISCLOSURES. We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright

Act of 1998, better known as the “DMCA”. Should we receive a claim of copyright

infringement, we will comply with the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA. Part of

that compliance may require the disclosure of your identity if you are either the allegedly

infringing party or the party filing the copyright infringement complaint.

4\. SECURITY

The Site has reasonable security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and

alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about

our ability to prevent any such loss to you or to any third party arising out of any such

loss, misuse, or alteration.
