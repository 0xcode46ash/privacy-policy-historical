_Children’s Privacy Policy – Information Collected Online in Contests and Sweepstakes_  
Some of our sites directed in whole or in part to children under the age of thirteen occasionally offer contests and/or sweepstakes. Our contests and sweepstakes are designed in such a manner that a child under the age of thirteen is not required to provide any personally-identifiable information about him/herself online (other than a parent’s e-mail address) prior to being selected as a winner. To participate in these contests or sweepstakes online, however, we may require the child to provide a screen name and a parent’s email address. We send an email to the parent notifying the parent that his/her child wishes to participate in the contest or sweepstakes. The parent has the option to withhold his/her consent to the child’s online participation in the contest or sweepstakes. If the parent does not withhold his/her consent and the child is a potential winner of a prize in the sweepstakes or contest, the parent must complete a form providing the information necessary to award the prize (such as the child’s name, age, address, social security number, and other personally identifiable information) and consenting to the disclosure of the child’s name, age, and other specified information that may be used in advertising and promotional activities related to the contest or sweepstakes. The parent is required to sign this form and return it to us, prior to any disclosure of the child’s personal information to third parties or the awarding of any prize.

The parental email address collected from each child is used solely to obtain parental consent, and it is not provided to any third party except those third parties we have engaged to assist us in running the contest or sweepstakes. These third parties are required to maintain the parental email in confidence and may use it only in connection with the services they are providing to us.

The information collected from winners may be (i) used in advertising and promotional activities relating to our contest and/or sweepstakes, which may include making certain of this information publicly available, and (ii) passed on to third parties for the purpose of awarding prizes, and, depending on the type of prize, these third parties may not be prohibited from using the information for purposes other than awarding the prize (such as marketing or advertising). Again, please note that personally identifiable information (other than a parent’s address) is collected only from the parents of children under the age of thirteen who have potentially won a prize, and only after the parent consents to the award of the prize and the disclosure of the information.
