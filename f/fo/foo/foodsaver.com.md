# FoodSaverÂ®, America's #1 Selling Brand of Home Vacuum Packaging Systems

Foodsaver.com and VillaWare.com are the website for Tilia Direct, Inc. ("Tilia"), a marketplace for Tilia FoodSaver products and VillaWare products distributed by Tilia. Because Tilia understands that your privacy is important to you, Tilia has established this privacy policy to explain what information is collected on foodsaver.com and villaware.com (the "Sites") and how it is used. 

**Information Gathered by Tilia**

For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical information, such as your IP address and the kind of browser you are using. If you choose to register with us, Tilia may ask you to provide personal information, such as your name and email address, or information about the Tilia products you own. If you choose to shop on the Sites, we also collect your financial information, such as your credit card number, along with billing, shipping and other transactional information. You may decline to share your information with us by choosing not to register on the Sites. However, your information might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of our services.

We may collect other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or if you contact us offline, such as through our call center. We may also correlate information collected on the Sites with data collected offline.

Tilia uses cookies to administer the Sites and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example, we may use cookies to record session information, such as items that customers add to their shopping cart, to alert users to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to the Sites, to record past activity in order to provide better service when users return, and to customize Web page content based on users' browser type or other information that the user sends. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but without our cookie you will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain features of the Sites.

Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded email messages. We use pixel tags to gather information about emails sent our users. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's email address, and other standard logging information. These pixel tags may also read cookies.

**Tilia's Use of Information**

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to provide our Sites and services to you. For example, we may use your information to fulfil your order, to send you information about our company and services or to contact you when necessary. We may also send email to users who have requested to receive it. In addition, we look at technical information to analyze traffic to the Sites, to enhance our offerings and to provide our service to you. For example, we may use traffic information to see which portions of the Sites are more frequently accessed and to gather broad demographic information.

We may share personally identifiable information about our users with third parties, including: (1) with your consent or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement; (2) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (3) where required by law; or (4) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public, or to protect the rights or property of Tilia or any third party. In addition, if you opt-in to receive message from our selected partners through the "My Account" page, Tilia may share personally identifiable information with third parties who we believe may have products or services of interest to our users. In addition, we may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with third parties.

In the event of a change of ownership or a direct merger with or acquisition by another entity, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

**Send to a Friend**

When you email a product to a friend, you and your friend's name and email addresses are required. This ensures that your friend will know you have requested that Tilia send them an email. Any email address obtained for the Send to a Friend service will only be used for this purpose.

**Surveys and Contests**

At various times we may offer surveys or contests to users. Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other demographic or personally identifiable information in order to determine eligibility. Tilia uses information collected from surveys and contests to improve its service and to notify and contact winners of various contests. From time to time, a contest may ask users to provide content, such as recipes or tips that make the most of their FoodSaver machine, which may be provided to the public.

**Third Parties**

The Sites may contain links to related sites and organizations. Tilia is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited.

If you request to have your information removed, Tilia will remove it from its active database, though it may continue to persist on back-up media.
