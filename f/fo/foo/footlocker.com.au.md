As you navigate through the Website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) through various technologies, such as cookies, internet tags or web beacons and navigational data collection.

The Website may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better services to Website visitors, customise the Website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the Website for your use.

####  **3\. Children**

Foot Locker does not sell products for purchase by children.  We sell children’s products for purchase by adults.  If you are under the age of sixteen (16), you need to get permission from your parent or guardian before providing any personal information to us or signing up to The Locker rewards program.

Foot Locker encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet, and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet.  

####  **4\. Use of personal information**

The personal information we collect from you may be used by us (and our employees, officers, agents and contractors) and our related companies within the Foot Locker group of companies for the following purposes:

In addition, you can opt-in to receive information about sales, promotions, and products from Foot Locker and its family of companies, including by way of email and SMS.  By checking the opt-in box, you consent to receiving our marketing materials, including by way of commercial electronic messages, for any of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  You may also opt-in to receive marketing materials from our carefully selected third party partners.  You have the right to unsubscribe to marketing materials at any time.

  * other companies within the Foot Locker family of companies worldwide (but only where those companies agree to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy);
  * to third parties appointed by Foot Locker, including our website hosting partner and advertising partner, who assist us to perform services (in which case Foot Locker requires these contractors to keep your personal information confidential and not to use or disclose it for any purpose other than the purpose of performing those services);
  * where you have expressly consented, to carefully selected third party partners, so that they may inform you of offers, promotions and services;
  * in the unlikely event that Foot Locker or its assets are acquired by a third party, the information may be provided to that third party;
