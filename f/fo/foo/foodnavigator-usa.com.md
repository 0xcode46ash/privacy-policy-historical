## Information We Collect and How We Collect It

**_General_**

We require you to provide us with certain information about yourself when you register for our newsletter service and when you request products and services. We also collect information from you when you participate in surveys and when you respond to requests for feedback;  
The information we collect may include information from which you may be personally identified (“ ** _Personally Identifiable Information_** ”), such as name, postal address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, and also may include certain business information, such as employer name, occupation, job function, job title and buying information (e.g., preferences or history). We also will collect credit card and related information when you request a product or service for which there is a charge. The Sites only collect Personally Identifiable Information with your knowledge. 

## Automatic Data Collection

When you visit the Sites, we may collect the IP address of your computer.  
We also automatically record other information that identifies your computer to the Sites and tracks your behavior on the Sites. For example, we may record how many times you visit the Sites and your navigation within the Sites. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information in this manner; however, if you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. 

Methods used to collect this information may include "cookies" and "clear GIFs" (also known as "pixel tags" or "web beacons"). 

Every browser (the vehicle by which a computer accesses the Internet) is assigned an ID number. That ID number is held in a file called a cookie. That number is not attached to a name, just a number. Site Publishers such as Decision News Media use cookies to enhance the user's Web viewing experience. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. A cookie is a small file of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers allow Users to block the receipt of cookies, but doing so may compromise your ability to use certain features of the Sites. A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message. 

A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We also use specific individual identifiers on e-mails which allows us to monitors which e-mails are successfully delivered and remove obsolete addresses from our database. For internal analytical purposes we sometimes link this individual identifier to the clear GIFs to allow us to see the general open rates and activity generated from newsletters. Information retrieved this way is used for statistical purposes only. It is never released to third parties and is part of our on-going efforts to improve the relevancy and quality of our products.

## Our Disclosure of Your Information

We will not disclose your information to anyone outside Decision News Media, except as described in this section.  
We may disclose aggregated anonymous statistics about many Users to advertisers, content and service providers and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies. 

We sometimes engage third parties to perform services for us, including in connection with the Sites that require us to disclose Users’ Personally Identifiable Information to them. If we make any such disclosure, we will require such parties to keep the information confidential and to use it only to perform the services. 

We also will disclose your information to third parties that market products or services using the Product Presentations and Company Profiles when you fill out an enquiry form. The information you supply on that form, and only that information, will be forwarded to the advertiser so they can provide you with the information you have requested.
