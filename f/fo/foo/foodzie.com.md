# Foodzie | Privacy Policy

This privacy policy covers the use of the Foodzie web site at [www.foodzie.com]() including how Foodzie treats personal information that Foodzie collects and receives. Pursuant to Foodzieâ€™s Terms of Use, you must be 18 years and older to use this site or have permission from a legal guardian.

What types of information is collected? And how do we use it?

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. Foodzie will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. Your information may be combined with information Foodzie collects from other companies and used to improve and personalize services, content and advertising.

Announcement for Account Users

Foodzie will send you a welcome/confirmation email when you sign up for Foodzie's services. Receipt of this email is required for using Foodzie's services. Foodzie will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by emailing [support@Foodzie.com](mailto:support@foodzie.com) from the email address you signed up with.

Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Foodzie products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Foodzie service. Foodzie uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Foodzie's services; display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Foodzie; estimate and report Foodzie's total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve Foodzie's content and services.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foodzie, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Foodzie user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to Foodzie's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Foodzie-related communications or for Foodzie-facilitated transactions. Foodzie has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Foodzie user to your email or physical mail list.

Forums 

If you use a form or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Foodzie is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Foodzie collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Foodzie does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Foodzie encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration Foodzie encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Foodzie follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Foodzie receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Foodzie strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Foodzie cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Foodzie's Web site, you can email Foodzie at support@Foodzie.com.
