**Privacy Policy**

_Cookies - What are these?_

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. Cookies are used to identify which areas of websites you have visited or customised, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Members who log on to Football-Data will have a cookie stored on their hard drive to recall the member's username and password up to 24 hours after they have logged on. After this time, a member will need to log on again to access the members' area. 

_Information Collected on Registering_

Access to Football-Data's results/odds data files and tipsters' analyses requires registration. Football-Data may use your contact e-mail to send information about the website from time to time, but no more than once monthly. Football-Data will, however, never share this e-mail with any other third person except as may be required by law. 

_Information Collected on Paying_

When you purchase membership at registration via debit/credit card using Nochex, Paypal or Clickbank, your information is directly transmitted to the credit card issuing/authorising bank network without Football-Data ever knowing or recording your debit/credit card number or information related to it. The only information Football-Data receives is your name, e-mail address and the amount paid by you. The link through which you enter you credit card number is secured using industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Further information about the methods of secure payment Football-Data utilises may be obtained through [Nochex](http://www.nochex.com/), [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/) and [Clickbank](http://www.clickbank.com/).
