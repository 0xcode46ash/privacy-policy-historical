We do not purchase bulk e-mail addresses nor do we use the services of bulk e-mail companies for promoting our service.

We always use industry standard encryption technologies, such as 128 bit SSL encryption, when transferring and receiving private consumer data on our site. This information can only be translated once it's received by our secure servers. These secure servers help to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you through our Web site.

If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
