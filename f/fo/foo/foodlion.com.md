**Privacy Policy** **Our Commitment To Privacy**  
At Food Lion, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this page explaining our online information practices. Since Internet technologies continue to evolve and Internet business models are not fully established, this policy is subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. **The Information We Collect**  
Food Lion monitors the non-personal information collected in our server log files. This information includes number of visitors to the site, most popular pages, operating system (for example, Macintosh or Windows), and browser type (for example, Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer). We use this information to help us improve our website and enhance your viewing experience. The server log files do not collect email addresses or other personally identifiable information. **Cookies**  
Occasionally our website may use temporary Cookie information to personalize your viewing experience. For example, we may store your zip code so we can display the stores closest to you. We do not, under any circumstances, correlate Cookie information with any identifiable information such as name or email address. **The Information You Provide**  
When you sign up for a promotion or request information, we may require your name, email address and mailing address to administer the promotion or provide you with the information you requested. We do not share this information with outside parties except where necessary to complete your request. **How to Change or Delete Your Information**  
If you have submitted personally identifiable information through our website and would like to change or delete that information, please email us at [flinfo@foodlion.com](mailto:flinfo@foodlion.com). In your email, please tell us which page or form on the website you used to submit your information. **Our Commitment to Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you. **Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
We believe protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18. From time to time we may display information that is specifically aimed at children, for example coloring pages. However, registration is never required to access these pages. **Surveys**  
The information we gather from online surveys is for Food Lion use only. We never request identifiable information such as name or email address. If we publish the results of a survey online, the information is in a collective, non-personally identifiable form. **Restrictions**  
If information received is harmful, obscene, threatening, criminal or has criminal implications, we reserve the right to use, disseminate, or store this information as we deem appropriate in our sole and absolute discretion. **Your Consent**  
By using our website, you agree to the conditions of this privacy policy. If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page to keep you informed of the information we collect, how we use this information, and whether the information is shared with other parties. **How to Contact Us**  
Should you have other questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please call us at 1-800-210-9569.
