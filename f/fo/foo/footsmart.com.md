At FootSmart we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Any questions regarding this privacy policy should be sent via email to [privacy@footsmart.com](mailto:privacy@footsmart.com)

  1. **Collection of Personal Information**
    1. **What information we collect**  
The only personal information that FootSmart collects is information voluntarily supplied by site visitors. This information is personally identifiable information such as name, address, email and phone number.

The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. To learn more about our marketing partner, click here.

If you prefer we do not share the personal information you have provided us and information about your order with marketing partners, please email us at [privacy@footsmart.com](mailto:privacy@footsmart.com).

If you agreed to receive email from our marketing partners by checking the box on the Checkout page and/or the Catalog Request page, we will share with them your email address and the information described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. Additionally, each email our partners send you will include a description of a simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving further email.

In addition to personal information, we collect site usage information to help in our efforts to continually improve our site. This information is IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged into, whether you responded to a particular ad, and/or what pages you are visiting on the website. We can only review this information in aggregate for all of our customers.

    2. **Where we collect the information**  
There are three areas on our site where we collect the personal information:   
\- the Check Out page   
\- the Catalog Request page   
\- the Online Newsletter and Promotional Email List subscription.
    3. **What we do with the information**  
Once we have collected the above information, it is used to process orders, to communicate with you about your order, and to provide future notification to you of special offers or promotions. We also use it to perform statistical analysis to improve our website.

We may provide statistical information about buying patterns and traffic patterns to others, but this data does not include any personally identifiable information.

    4. **Use of Cookies**  
This web site uses "session cookies" to keep track of your order in your shopping cart. The "cookie" that our server requests to set on your browser (if you have cookie warnings turned on in your browser preferences) is simply a 5- or 6- digit customer number used to identify you each time you add an item to your shopping cart, display your cart, or check out. The "cookie" is programmed so that it will not remain on your computer once you have closed your browser -- it is only active for your current "session."
  2. **Receiving Information From FootSmart**
    1. **Email**  
FootSmart periodically sends email to our customers to help keep you informed of FootSmart's new products, features and/or special promotions. In every email that we distribute, we include instructions on how to remove (unsubscribe) your email address from the distribution list. This is located at <http://www.footsmart.com/mail> or you may simply email us at [customerservice@footsmart.com](mailto:customerservice@footsmart.com) and request to be removed from the mailing list. 
    2. **Catalog**  
In addition to shopping on our website, FootSmart distributes a full-product catalog. We send these catalogs throughout the year to our registered users and customers. If you would like to receive the most current catalog, go to: http://www.footsmart.com/catalog. If you no longer wish to receive our catalog, please email us at [customerservice@footsmart.com](mailto:customerservice@footsmart.com).
  3. **Changing Personal Information (Effective w/ Ecometry)**  
If you need to make any changes to your personally stored information, it is possible to update your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number and email address in two areas on our site:   
\- In My Account   
\- During checkout, when you modify your account information. 
  4. **Online policy for individuals 17 years old and under**  
This site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and no information should be submitted through the website by individuals 17 years of age and under without their parent's or guardian's permission. 
  5. **Secure Credit Card Transaction Processing**  
Our web site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit your credit card information from a secure web page to a secure application on our server. Once on our server, your credit card number is saved only long enough for us to process and approve the transaction.

During the final stages of ordering online, you will see an unbroken key or locked padlock at the bottom of your browser window and https:// in the location window at the top of your browser. Both of these indicate that the page you are on is secured using SSL encryption to communicate with our secure web server.

Because SSL encryption slows down a web site, it is only used in the final stage of ordering, before and after you enter your credit card information. You will not see these security indicators until you begin the checkout process and indicate that you prefer to order online with a credit card. 

  6. **Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions**   
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FootSmart. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of our policies. 
  7. **Contact FootSmart with questions**
    1. **Phone - 1.800.230.4077**
    2. **Email**
