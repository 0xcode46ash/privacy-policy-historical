Privacy Policy  
  
---  
At FootSmart we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Any questions regarding this privacy policy should be sent via email to [ privacy@footsmart.com](mailto:privacy@footsmart.com)  
1.  Collection of Personal Information  
a. What information we collect  
| 

The only personal information that FootSmart collects is information voluntarily supplied by site visitors. This information is personally identifiable information such as name, address, email and phone number. The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. 

If you prefer we do not share the personal information you have provided us and information about your order with marketing partners, please email us at [ privacy@footsmart.com](mailto:privacy@footsmart.com) . 

In addition to personal information, we collect site usage information to help in our efforts to continually improve our site. This information is IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged into, whether you responded to a particular ad, and/or what pages you are visiting on the website. We can only review this information in aggregate for all of our customers. Our site is tracked by WebTrends Live. You should refer to the WebTrends Live Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find WebTrends Live's privacy policy here: [ http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.html](http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.html).  
  
b. Where we collect the information  
| There are four areas on our site where we collect the personal information:   
\- the Check Out page   
\- the Create Account page   
\- the Catalog Request page   
\- Promotional Email subscription.  
  
c. What we do with the information  
| 

Once we have collected the above information, it is used to process orders, to communicate with you about your order, and to provide future notification to you of special offers or promotions. We also use it to perform statistical analysis to improve our website. We may provide statistical information about buying patterns and traffic patterns to others, but this data does not include any personally identifiable information.  
  
  
d. Use of Cookies  
| 

Cookies are small files of identifying information stored in your Internet browser. To provide our customers with personalization and convenience, FootSmart.com is programmed to use cookies in two scenarios. 

First, if you have voluntarily chosen to setup an online customer account, we, in turn, can personally welcome you each time you visit our site. We can provide easy access to your order history and a personalized shopping experience. If you begin shopping and wish to come back at a later time to complete the checkout process, we are able to retrieve your shopping bag upon your return. 

Second, if you are a first time visitor and/or do not have an existing customer account, we do keep track of your items in your shopping bag within a single visit. The cookie is programmed so that it will not remain on your computer once you have closed your browser -- it is only active for your current session. 

Cookies do allow our customers to benefit from timesaving customer service features, but at anytime, you can control your cookie settings by updating your browser preferences.  
  
2.  Receiving Information From FootSmart  
a. Email  
| 

FootSmart periodically sends email to our customers to help keep you informed of FootSmart's new products, features and/or special promotions. In every email that we distribute, we include instructions on how to remove [unsubscribe] your email address from the distribution list or you may simply email us with our [ Customer Service Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20031001165407id_/http%3A//footsmart.com/ContactUs.aspx) and request to be removed from the mailing list.  
  
  
b. Catalog  
| 

In addition to shopping on our website, FootSmart distributes a full-product catalog. We send these catalogs throughout the year to our registered users and customers. If you would like to receive the most current catalog, go to: [ Catalog Request](https://web.archive.org/web/20031001165407id_/http%3A//footsmart.com/CatalogRequest.aspx).  If you no longer wish to receive our catalog, please email us with our [Customer Service Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20031001165407id_/http%3A//footsmart.com/ContactUs.aspx).  
  
3.  Changing Personal Information  
  
If you need to make any changes to your personally stored information it is possible to update your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number and email address by clicking on "Access Your Account" or during checkout, when you modify your account information.  
  
4.  Online policy for individuals 17 years old and under  
  
This site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and no information should be submitted through the website by individuals 17 years of age and under without their parent's or guardian's permission.  
  
5.  Secure Credit Card Transaction Processing  
  
Our web site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit your credit card information from a secure web page to a secure application on our server. Once on our server, your credit card number is saved only long enough for us to process and approve the transaction. **FootSmart.com does not store your credit card information as part of your online customer account profile.**

During the final stages of ordering online, you will see an unbroken key or locked padlock at the bottom of your browser window and https:// in the location window at the top of your browser. Both of these indicate that the page you are on is secured using SSL encryption to communicate with our secure web server. Because SSL encryption slows down a web site, it is only used in the final stage of ordering, before and after you enter your credit card information. You will not see these security indicators until you begin the checkout process and indicate that you prefer to order online with a credit card.  
  
6.  Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions  
  
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FootSmart. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of our policies.
