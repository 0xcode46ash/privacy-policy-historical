**Information About All eDine.com Visitors**   
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how eDine.com users, collectively, use our site. 

**Information About You Specifically**   
In some instances, such as on the registration page, the "My eDine" pages and others, we may need more specific information about you. This information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and etc.  This information will be used to advise restaurants where and when you would like orders processed, was well as how you wish to pay for them.  We may use that information to contact you regarding a contest you have entered, to make you aware of additional products and services that you may find of interest, or to contact you regarding site updates and enhancements. Of course you may choose to  opt out of these services  (see opt out below).  We may also ask you for other information such as your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, and the types of foods you are interested in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.

While we request some personal information, we limit those requests to those items necessary to use the service. All user information is proprietary to eDine.com unless otherwise noted. You must consent for the sharing of your personal information if you want to use eDine.com.  In the cases of back office services, such as [Passport](http://www.passport.com/), registering with a service submits your registration form to that company directly. Please visit our business partners' websites for information on their privacy policies or request them directly from our partners in the event their policies are not readily available. 

**General Information Disclosure**   
eDine.com will not disclose information about your individual visits to our website or any of the personal information that you provide such as your name, address, telephone number, or credit card to any outside parties except when we believe the law requires. However, we may record and share aggregated information with our business partners. Additionally, any information that you enter on a co-branded registration page becomes the property of both eDine.com and the co-branded partner. In that instance, eDine.com is not responsible for any of the information received by our partner company. Again, registration forms for back office services may be transmitted to our partner's domain. In some instances personal information may be passed from eDine.com to our partners in order to automatically "log you in" to their websites.  While we make all efforts to protect your privacy when negotiating our partnerships, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information. To that end, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of our partners, or request them directly from our partners in the event they are not readily available. 

**Cookies**   
We use cookies on certain pages of our site. Many of our features are only available through the use of a cookie. Among other reasons why we use cookies, cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session, keep track of your preferences and aid in the user experience. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. The majority of our cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use most of the features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. 

**Log Files**   
eDine.com captures industry standard information solely for the purposes of analysis. Information contained in log files is intended for internal use only and will not be disclosed to our partners. The aggregate logged information is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**Opt Out**   
eDine.com is set up so that after registration you automatically receive subsequent deliveries of critical information, such as notice of new member restaurants in your area, site upgrades and enhancements, new features, user tips, and additional information on products and services. Should you desire to "opt out" from receiving this information, please visit the "My eDine" section of the site or email [optout@edine.com](mailto:optout@edine.com) with your request. 

**Correcting, Updating or Reviewing Your Personal Information**   
Please visit the "My eDine" section of the site to correct, update or review your personal information. Alternatively, you can also send email to [support@edine.com](mailto:support@edine.com) with the information that you want changed, or to request your record be deleted from our database. If updating your information, please be specific. Changes may take up to a few business days. 

**Security**   
eDine.com adheres to industry standards in protecting the confidentiality of your personal and identifiable information from outside sources. eDine.com's servers are hosted within password protected servers. While eDine.com maintains all reasonable efforts in protecting your personal information, absolute security does not exist on the Internet.

eDine.com addresses internal security by making it a part of all new employee orientations at eDine.com. In the event our privacy policy changes, those changes are distributed internally to all eDine.com employees (and of course to all our members). 

**Feedback**   
Please submit any feedback to [feedback@edine.com](mailto:feedback@edine.com). Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of eDine.com. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site. 

**Privacy Commitment Changes**   
If at some point in the future, there is a change to our information usage practices that affects your personal information, we will notify you by email of the relevant changes. At the time of this message, you will be able to opt out of this information usage by sending a message to the following email: [optout@edine.com](mailto:optout@edine.com). You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.

Please feel free to contact us at eDine.com, 2820 Tennis Club Dr. #405 West Palm Beach, FL 33417, or send email to [privacy@edine.com](mailto:privacy@edine.com) iif, at any time, you have questions, comments or concerns about eDine.com's privacy commitment.
