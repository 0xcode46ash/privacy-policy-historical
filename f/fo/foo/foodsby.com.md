# Foodsby - Terms Of Use

Your privacy is important to Foodsby LLC (“Foodsby”), and we go to great lengths to protect it. This Privacy Policy applies to the online collection of personal information via software and Internet services and is incorporated into any applicable user agreement and service terms and any general terms of use for the website found at [www.foodsby.com](http://www.foodsby.com/) (“Site”; collectively, “Services”). This Policy does not apply to information collected in any other way. The Services may contain links to sites maintained by others. This Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of those sites. By using the above Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to Foodsby’s processing of personal information and non-personal information for the purposes provided in the Privacy Policy. You further consent to reviewing the Privacy Policy from time to time to view any updates. 

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FOODSBY COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?**

We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web server logs, and through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or when you authorize us to (for example, to our restaurant partners from whom you may order and receive food delivery). 

_User-Supplied Information_

When you register for our services or order products via our site, we ask you to provide some personal information, for example, your name, address, phone number, email address, payment card information, and/or certain additional categories of information resulting from use of our websites and services. Other than payment card information, we keep this information in a contact database for future reference, as needed. We do not store any payment card information. Only our payment card processor has access to that information. We may use your email address you provide to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, via our newsletter. If you don't wish to receive such offers, you may opt out (unsubscribe) via the link provided in these newsletters. 

If you contact us for customer support, we may ask you to provide information about your computer or about the issues you are trying to resolve. This information is necessary to help us answer your questions. We may record your requests and our responses for quality control purposes. 

Foodsby may make websites available to you for chat rooms, forums, message boards, or news groups. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is public. You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these areas. Don't disclose information in these public forums that might be considered confidential. 

We may track information about your visit to the Site and store that information in web or mobile server logs, which are records of the activities on the Site. Our servers automatically capture and save the information electronically. Examples of the information we may collect include: 

Your unique Internet protocol address 

The name of your unique Internet service provider 

The city, state, and country from which you access the Services 

The kind of browser or computer you use 

The number of links you click within the Site 

The date and time of your visit 

The web page from which you arrived to our site 

The pages you viewed on the Site 

Certain searches/queries that you conducted via our website(s) 

The information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the Site, analyze its usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience. 

_Cookies_

In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to reenter them each time you visit. 

The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies. 

_Third Party Services_

We may use services hosted by third parties, such as Google® Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors. Please see "Cookies" in the section above for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer. 

_Children’s Privacy_

Services are not structured nor intended for users under 18 years of age. Accordingly, Foodsby will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from persons that Foodsby knows to be under the age of 18. 

**HOW DOES FOODSBY PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?**

We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Also, we store the information about you in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures. 

Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this policy. 

**WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other customer data to others, and we will not make your personal information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as follows: 

· To restaurant partners, agents and/or contractors who may use it on in connection with their relationship with us (for example, restaurants will use your personal information to deliver food orders you placed on the Site). 

· As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property. 

· We may rely on affiliates for support of the products and services we offer. If so, our affiliates would be required to preserve the confidentiality of any personal information they may access. 

· We will not disclose any information about your unique usage to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, including their ability to offer products and services, or as required by law. 

· As noted above, we may use statistics or other data regarding your usage of the Services for product development or other business analytic purposes, but only in anonymized aggregate form. We may make such data and statistics available to third parties, such as potential or existing customers, for business development, marketing or sales purposes. 

Your access to some of Services and content may be password protected. We recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

**HOW MAY I CORRECT, AMEND, OR DELETE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR UPDATE MY PREFERENCES?**

You may cancel your registration or update your preferences at any time. If you don't want to receive information about our products or services, please update your account preferences (where available), check the appropriate box when registering, and/or utilize the "unsubscribe" mechanism within the communications that you receive from us.
