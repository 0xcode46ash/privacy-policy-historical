This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.

If you are a user with general public and anonymous access, the Food Standards Agency website does not capture or store personal information about you but simply logs your IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web server. This is known as a 'log file' which we use to compile site usage statistics.

We do not use cookies for collecting personal user information and we will not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of our web server and reporting site usage.

This privacy statement only covers Food Standards Agency websites. It does not cover links within Food Standards Agency sites to other websites.

The system will record your email address and other information if volunteered to us by you. This shall be treated as proprietary and confidential. It may be used for internal review and to notify you about updates to Food Standards Agency websites.
