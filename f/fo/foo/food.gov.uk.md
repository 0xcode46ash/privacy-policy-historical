# Privacy policy | Food Standards Agency

## How we handle your personal data

The Food Standards Agency is what is known as the ‘Controller’ of the personal data we collect from you or which is provided to us.

When we collect your personal information, we will:

  * make sure you know why we need it and why we are legally allowed to hold it
  * only ask for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant information
  * protect it and make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
  * let you know if we share it with other organisations
  * make sure we don’t keep it longer than necessary



All the personal data we process is located on servers within the European union. Our cloud based services have been procured through the government framework agreements and these services have been assessed against the national cyber security centre cloud security principles.
