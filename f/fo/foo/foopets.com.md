This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") explains how personal information is safely handled by www.FooPets.com and all other FooMojo, Inc. web sites, applications and portals. FooPets.com provides a fun and safe virtual experience for people of all ages. 

FooMojo, Inc. ("FooMojo") is committed to protecting all personal information collected from our site visitors, community members, contributors, and partners. We’ve taken precautions and measures to help keep our visitors’ identities and personal information safe and private and ensure that our “Policy” and our information collection and storage practices follow the U.S. Department of Commerce and European Commission’s "Safe Harbor" Framework. 

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information specifically identifies an individual with a name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, passwords, credit card or other account number—and may include information about that individual's FooPet? activities and account. Personal information also includes demographic data, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when linked to other personal information that identifies an individual. 

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data collected about a group or category of products, services or customers from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. 

### Personal Information We Collect

We currently do not accept registrations from children under 13 years old. FooPets provides a realistic and educational pet adoption experience that should be shared with an adult, just like real pet ownership. If you are under the age of 13, please have your parent or guardian register and assign you a FooPet, then together share the daily experience of pet ownership. 

For those 13 years and older, we will collect and protect the following personal information:

  * Name
  * Password
  * Email
  * Date Of Birth
  * Gender



When completing a financial transaction from FooPets.com, we will collect and protect the following information:

  * Credit card number, expiration, cvs code
  * Billing name, address, city, state, zip/postal code, country



Important Note: In our public communications areas (blog and wiki), you have the option of telling the FooPet? community how you wish to be identified in connection with your information, comments, passwords, etc. If you choose to use your real name (or include any personally identifying information as part of your "nickname") that information will be publicly displayed on our site. Therefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified on the site. 

We do not collect "sensitive data" that pertains to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or health or sex life. 

We enable you to invite your gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Hotmail, LinkedIn, and other contacts to join FooPets.com. We will display your contacts from any address book(s) of your choice. You can also text input addresses. We will send out the invitations on your behalf. However, we do not store these email addresses in any database or repository. 

### Why We Collect Personal Information

FooPets is an interactive gaming and social networking application and requires a valid email address correlated with the user name(s) in order to become a FooPet owner. We use this information to send notifications and links that can be used to activate your account and update you on our latest offerings, promotions and news. You can also opt-in to receive messages on your FooPets status. 

We authenticate with email addresses and passwords to enable proper access to users' accounts. We also monitor usage to make sure FooPets owners are following the Terms and Conditions of our site. Monitoring in this manner is intended to protect our community members and preserve a safe, fair, and positive experience for everyone. We may use an email address to temporarily or permanently ban a person from playing on FooPets if inappropriate and disruptive conduct ensues. 

As mentioned above, we request additional personally identifiable information from members wanting to complete financial transactions for added features and services that we may offer. 

We may also use information in an aggregate form to analyze site patterns and usage to assist in creating new features, products, programs or services. For some of our activities (polls or surveys), we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable (e.g. favorite animal, top dog breeds, etc.) 

We may request user name and email address a form is submitted through our ‘contact us’ page, blogs, forums or wiki area of our website. This ensures that we provide respond in a timely manner, or track and monitor correspondence that may be deemed inappropriate or disturbing to the community. 

We may passively collect certain non-personally identifiable computer information such as the type of operating system (Windows XP, Mac OS), the user’s IP address, type of web browser (Internet Explorer, Firebox, Safari) and information regarding the Internet service provider used, and possibly link this information to the user account and personal information. If we do this, we will secure this data. 

Lastly, we collect financial or payment information used for no other purpose than processing payments to FooMojo, Inc. The financial information entered to acquire a membership is not stored by FooMojo, but is instead retained by our payments processing vendor Cybersource specifically to securely manage credit card payments made to FooMojo, Inc. 

If personal information is not provided but necessary to create an account, then FooMojo, Inc. may not agree to membership and may not be able to provide access to certain areas and functionality on the FooPet website(s), application(s), or portal(s) or provide information, products, or services that may be requested. 

In case of a merger or business transfer, a sale or transfer of our assets, or if we sell all or part of our business, we may transfer personal information to a third party as part of that business transaction to the extent permitted by law. 

### How We Collect and Process Your Information

All personal information is processed fairly and lawfully. We ask for consent before collecting personal information, and disclose when it is collected and how the data will be used. We do not ask for information that is out of scope of the purpose for which it is collected. In addition, the use of personal information is not used beyond what has been disclosed. Participants that provide personal information can later view, change any inaccuracies, or delete their data at any time. 

### What We Don’t Do

We know how intrusive it is to get spam, unsolicited phone calls, and 'junk' mail. This is why we will not contact you unless specifically request to be contacted. The log in area is designed to provide visitors with FooPet and company information that requires email verification and proper internal approval within FooMojo. We do not share, rent, or sell this information with any person, business, or organization. 

Other areas of our website, specifically our applications, enable visitors to experience the fun, convenience, and excitement of FooPets. Information entered in these sections will not be permanently stored and/or used, nor will it be exposed or exploited through FooMojo or any third party affiliate or otherwise. This information will not be shared, sold, or rented to any person, business organization. 

### Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell, rent, or share personal information to any person, business, or organization without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. 

We will disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant, or court order) or at the request of law enforcement authorities or as a result of the unlawful use of our site. If we reasonably believe that an emergency involving danger of serious physical injury or death to any person(s) requires disclosure of communications or records, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to disclose this information promptly. In addition, information about our customers including personally identifiable information may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets. 

### Information Shared With Other Users

Your account information is displayed to other users in your FooPet profile. This information may also be available through automated script calls and application program interfaces. This information includes your username, FooPet(s) name(s), FooDollars and FooKarma information (quantities). We do not display your address, credit card number, or bank account numbers. 

You may choose to disclose your own personal information in our online forums, or wikis. Please be aware that this information is public and therefore not held confidential or private in these settings.
