### Information Collection and Use

A special note about children: FEARnet does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, except for the limited circumstances described below, and does not wish to collect any such information. Federal law requires website operators who collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen to first get parental consent. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. In the event a child under the age of 13 submits a question to us on the Website and identifies his or her age, we may use the child's e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding to the child's question on a one-time-only basis. However, we will not use the child's e-mail address to re-contact the child and we will delete it from our records once we have responded. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.

### What categories of personally identifiable information do we collect?

The information collected by FEARnet falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to and users of the Website and (2) tracking information recorded as visitors and users navigate through the Website. Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. 

To make use of some features on our Website visitors and users need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may ask, for example, for your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code. We might also request information about your computer, for example, in order to provide you with services and features. In addition, we may ask you for information about your interests in television viewing and the like. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, complete the function of the Website, and tailor our Website to your interests to make it more useful to you. Our systems will remember some of this information the next time you log in and use our Website, but you can always review and change your information by following the instructions below under Changes to Information in this privacy statement. 

Completing the registration process and supplying information to us through the Website is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to register and supply the requested information, we may be unable to provide you with the products and services we make available to other registered users, such as the ability to order and purchase products and services, or participate in contests, sweepstakes and other promotions through the Website. 

When you submit any personally identifiable information through this Website, FEARnet (i) will use the information for the purposes described at the time you submit it (for example, your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address provided while ordering one of our products or services will be used in connection with the processing and fulfillment of your order) and (ii) may also use the information to contact you to make you aware of other products and services of interest. You may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the opt-out procedures set forth below. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the publicly available content on our Website without registration. 

### What categories of persons or entities do we share personally identifiable information with?

We consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential. We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties who perform certain services on our behalf. For example, when you use certain functions on this Website you may notice that the website actually collecting or processing the information may be other than this Website. We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties in order to provide you with special offers and opportunities that we think may be of interest to you. Note that although we advise everyone who receives personally identifiable information from us as to the proper use of such information, we do not control, nor can we be responsible for, their information-handling practices. We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary in order to: (i) fulfill a government request; (ii) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served on us; (iii) to protect or defend our legal rights or property, the Website, or other users of the Website; or (iv) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of the Website's users or the general public.

As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of this Website will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.

### What do we do to personalize your use of this Website?

To help make our Website more responsive to the needs of our users and visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." We use cookies to help us tailor our Website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service, and to remember certain choices you've made so you don't have to re-enter them. 

We use two kinds of cookies: (i) temporary or "session"-based cookies that contain certain information about a user's or visitor's use of our Website at a particular time and (ii) "persistent" cookies that contain certain account-related information about a registered user's use of our Website. Session-based cookies are automatically disabled or deleted when a user of or visitor to our Website closes his or her browser software at the end of session. Persistent cookies remain stored on a registered user's computer system until he or she disables or deletes them. You may read about enabling, disabling, and deleting cookies at www.FEARnet.com at any time by visiting the About Cookies page or by searching for "cookie" and clicking on the link for the topic you wish to read. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to and users of our Website. 

The cookies we use don't directly identify visitors to or users of our Website as particular persons. Rather, they contain information sufficient to simplify and improve a visitor's or user's experience on our Website. For example, we may use session-based cookies to track the pages on our Website visited by our users. We can build a better website if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Or, we may use persistent cookies to simplify access to a user's account information over our Website, for example. 

In connection with the standard operation of FEARnet's systems, certain non-personally identifiable information about visitors to this Website is recorded. This information is used primarily to tailor and enhance visitors' experience using the Website. We may use this information in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to, among other things, measure the use of our Website and determine which products and services are the most popular with our Website visitors. 

Ads appearing on this Website may be delivered to users by this Website or a third party advertising partner. These partners may set cookies, which may allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you (or others who are using your computer) saw their advertisements and determine click-through rates and history on such ads. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of more interest to you than advertising selected randomly or by other means. This privacy statement covers only the use of cookies by this Website and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers, who may have their own, differing policies.

### Where do we permit visitors and users to opt in or out of FEARnet promotional e-mail?

If you are a registered member of FEARnet.com, you may choose to receive, or not receive, promotional e-mails about FEARnet's services by going to the Internet web page located at http://www.fearnet.com/CommunityMemberPreferences.aspx and following the instructions there. If you have otherwise provided your e-mail address to FEARnet, or FEARnet has already obtained it, then FEARnet may have already contacted you about receiving promotional e-mails separately.

Other Websites 

To make our Website more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Our Website may also include links to other websites whose privacy policies and practices we don't control. Once you leave our Website by linking to another one (you can tell where you are by checking the address --known as a URL-- in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the website directly for more information. 

### Security

All information gathered on our Website is stored within a FEARnet-controlled database accessible only to FEARnet and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by FEARnet may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. If you don't want us to know any particular information about you, don't include it in anything that you submit or post to this Website or send to us in e-mail. 

### Changes to Information

You may review and change information that you provide to us through this Website by returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information directly. 

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

Please return to this Website and review this privacy statement from time to time as it may be modified without notice. The most current version of this privacy statement will be posted on our Website, and by continuing to use the Website, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as modified.
