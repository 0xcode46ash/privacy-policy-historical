Hi Unregistered, 

Update:

The F11 golden release is here! So far, the stampede we expected hasn't arrived. As expected, F11 has not been entirely trouble free, but most folks are having little or no trouble with it, and installs are going smoothly. 

Remember folks, fedora is a bit of a cutting edge FOSS based distro, so system requirements may well include a sense of adventure and a willingness to fiddle and futz a bit to get things like you want them.

_However, one issue seems to be consistent. for those installing from the liveCDs, check the announcement about partitioning requirements!_

So far, increased loads haven't been a problem, but if that situation develops, we will still restrict features as we had planned. 

Thank you for your patience and your continued support of both fedora and the fedora forum. 

Dan

The following policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you and the way that way we use and don't use this information.

The information that we collect about our visitors falls into three general categories:

1\. Information You Provide to Us. We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us either on the FedoraForum.org site, via e-mail, or in any other way. Some examples of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your name or e-mail address) when you register for FedoraForum.org membership, information that you post on message boards, and information contained in search requests or questions you submit to the site.

2\. Information that is Automatically Collected. We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the FedoraForum.org site. For example, to enhance your experience at FedoraForum.org, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where you have entered preference information before. Another example of information that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site.
