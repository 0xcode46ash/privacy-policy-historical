# The Office of the Federal Register (OFR)

## Legal Authority

The FederalRegister.gov web site and the Electronic Public Inspection Desk service are authorized by the Office of the Federal Register (OFR), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  This web site is maintained by the OFR and the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) as an e-Government service of the NARA/GPO partnership.  This site hosts the Electronic Public Inspection Desk, which provides full-text, global access to the pre-publication versions of documents scheduled to appear in the _Federal Register_ on GPOaccess.gov.  It also functions as a portal to the official Federal Register publications on GPOaccess.gov, and to Federal Register information services on Archives.gov. 

The Office of the Federal Register is required to file documents for public inspection at least one Federal government business day before publication in the _Federal Register_ in accordance with [44 U.S.C. 1507](http://archives.gov/federal-register/laws/federal-register) and [1 CFR part 17](http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=a26e2ea2b7aba1f98782f34ecf4fa64c&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title01/1cfr17_main_02.tpl).  After documents are received, indexed, edited, and reviewed for compliance with legal requirements, the OFR makes a public inspection version of the document available at the Federal Register office, 800 North Capitol Street NW, Washington, D.C.  The actual date and time of filing is specified on the filed document, and reflects the point at which the document is available to the public at the Federal Register office in Washington D.C., rather than the time of Internet posting.

A full-text version of the filed document is posted to the FederalRegister.gov web site shortly after the document is publicly available at the Federal Register office.  The time of posting to the web site will vary depending upon server usage and other factors, but the controlling point of public release is indicated on the filed document by a time/date stamp, regardless of Internet availability.  The legally controlling version of a public inspection document is the official record filed at the Federal Register office in Washington D.C. because of the possibility that artifacts or textual variations may be introduced through electronic processing and the file conversions required for Internet posting.  Similarly, the legally controlling version of a document printed in the _Federal Register_ and posted in the online edition on GPO Access is the official record filed at the Federal Register office.  See 44 U.S.C. 1507(3).
