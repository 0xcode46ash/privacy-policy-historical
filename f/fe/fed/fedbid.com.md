At FedBid, your privacy as an individual or entity is highly regarded and important to us. We take our commitment to our customers very seriously. Accordingly, we will not sell any personally identifiable Information you supply us. You can review the full policy below for more details. 

  
When you register, we ask for your name, email address, and profile Information, such as supervisor name (if any). We may also request additional Information for optional online surveys and identification verification. In the course of using the Web Site, we log certain other Information, including your IP address, what browser you are using, the URL you just came from, and your activity on, and use of the Web Site. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the site, we may store such Information. 

  
We use Information to provide Services, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, review Web Site usage, generate aggregate usage reports, and improve Web Site content, layout and Services. We may use the Information we collect to occasionally notify you about new offerings from FedBid and special offers we think you might find useful. If you would rather not receive such notices, please let us know by contacting us at [clientservices@fedbid.com](mailto:clientservices@fedbid.com). We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web Site and, as necessary, your email address, mailing address, telephone or facsimile number, to contact you. 

We may occasionally have a strategic business relationship with another company and choose to integrate a portion or version of our Web Site, Services, content or branding with those offered by that company. In such case, we may agree to share your Information with that company; however, we will do so only subject to strict confidentiality and use obligations and restrictions. Moreover, we will not disclose Information that is unnecessary to the relationship.   We may also distribute to other parties for marketing and promotional purposes aggregate FedBid business Information from which you cannot be personally identified. In the absence of a strategic relationship, and except in the course of providing the Services, we do not pass on your Information to any party without your expressed permission. 

We may disclose user Information in special cases when we have reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a party that may be causing injury to or interfering with (either intentionally or unintentionally) FedBid's rights or property, other FedBid users, or any other party that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
