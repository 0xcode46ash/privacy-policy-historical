## Privacy Statement

  


(Last Revised September 27, 2001) 

General. This web site (the "Site") is operated by WTOP AM/FM, a division of Bonneville International Corp. ("Operator"). The following Privacy Statement (the "Statement") supplements the Terms of Use available at the site. You should read the Statement and the Terms of Use before you use the Site. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and notices contained or referenced herein. Operator may change the Statement at any time by posting revisions to the Site. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of the revised Statement. You should review the Statement from time to time. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Statement, you must exit the Site immediately. 

No Use by Children. The Site is not directed to, or intended for use by, children (defined as anyone age thirteen or younger). Children should not use the Site or submit any information to Operator. 

What Information is Collected. In connection with your use of the Site, Operator may collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) and aggregate information (such as your IP address - a number used to identify your computer when you are on the Internet - or the type of browser you are using). 

Personally Identifiable Information. You may be asked to voluntarily provide personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information") in order to participate in some features of the Site. (For example, you may be asked to provide Personal Information in order to enter an online contest or to receive news updates by email.) In addition, Operator may ask you to provide Personal Information for purposes unrelated to the use of a feature at the Site. In either case, you can always refuse to provide Personal Information, but this may result in decreased functionality of the Site for you and limit Operator's ability to inform you about products or services that may be of particular interest.
