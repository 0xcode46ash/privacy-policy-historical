Please see [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/us/services/conditions/) of the FedEx Service Guide for limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranty applicable to FedEx services and information used in providing those services. 

**What information does FedEx capture on visitors to its Web site?**

For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes only the time of access and the visitor's domain name, not the visitor's email address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP Address, for identification purposes)

**Does FedEx ask for personal information?**

While at fedex.com, there are five areas where we ask for this type of information. They are: [Site](https://www.fedex.com/us/registration/site.html), [Account](https://www.fedex.com/us/registration/account.html), [FedEx interNetShip](https://www.fedex.com/cgi-bin/ship_it/interNetRegister?us), [FedEx Ship Download](https://web.archive.org/us/software/eshipping/ship.html#download) and [FedEx NetReturn Registration](https://web.archive.org/us/services/netreturn/returnform.html) areas.

Even in those areas, business related information including your name, address, email address, billing information, and profiling questions. The reason we collect this information is to help us further develop our services, to provide you access to valuable FedEx Internet-based information and services, and to bill you for those services if you elect to use them.

**How does FedEx use the information I provide?**

The information we collect helps us identify the type of Web site content our customers value most. We then use this information to improve the Web site. We also use this information to send you email notifications about updates to our Web site (only when you give us permission to send this type of email) and to contact you for marketing purposes (again, only if you give us permission). None of the information collected by FedEx is shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

**Will FedEx use my information for any other purposes?**

FedEx may periodically send you information about our various products and services.

**Does FedEx use cookies?**

FedEx uses cookies to achieve two goals. The first is to provide FedEx with the capability to customize information for certain segments of its customer base. Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow FedEx the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles. As an example, through the use of cookies, FedEx interNetShip's "Easy Login" feature can automatically fill in key information, and in the process save you time.

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a Web site, is placed by the Web Server into the browser's application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the Web site to "recognize" you as a unique individual.

Please note that in most instances a cookie does not enable a User to be recognized as a name (e.g., John Doe). Rather, it will recognize an individual as a series of numbers (e.g., TRACKID=MC_53011).

**How do I contact FedEx?**
