Fellowship Technologies agrees to notify you of the following:

  * What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personal identification is collected from you through the website
  * The organization collecting the information
  * How the information is used
  * With whom the information may be shared
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information

If you feel that Fellowship Technologies is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact us by addressing your concerns to [cpo@fellowshiptech.com](mailto:cpo@fellowshiptech.com).

Fellowship Technologies collects information from customer prospects and other interested parties on our website to enable us to better inform you about our product. By knowing your preferences we can deliver relevant information that meets your needs and ensure that your visit to our site is quick, easy and productive. Fellowship Technologies is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

### Collected Information

In order to use some functions on this website, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration, the user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Fellowship Technologies does not share any personally identifiable or private customer information submitted online with third parties. Demographic information may also be requested (such as zip code or type of business). This information may be stored, analyzed and used to assist us to improve our services.

### Cookies

Fellowship Technologies uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to simplify and enhance the experience on our site (i.e. prefilling forms similar to those you may have already completed). Once the user closes their browser, the cookie information is no longer available through our server. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. If a user rejects the cookie, they can still use our site.

### Log Files

We use IP addresses in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files do not enable us to access personally identifying information, such as email addresses.

### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Fellowship Technologies is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected at this website.

### Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, they must opt in. At that point we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter can unsubscribe when they receive it by clicking on a link at the bottom of the newsletter. The user will then be given an opportunity to opt in or out of future newsletters and opt in or out of further periodic Fellowship Technologies communications.

### Children

Fellowship Technologies products are for use by organizations. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any individual under the age of 18.

### Security

Fellowship Technologies takes precautions to protect our customers' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line using standard security best practices such as firewalls, encryption and intrusion detection. Full backups are performed every week on the entire file system and incremental backups are done daily. Finally, all hosted servers are kept physically secure in a world-class hosting data center.

### Updating Personal Information and Opting Out

We encourage our users to update our record of any personal information that changes (such as your zip code). Information can be corrected/updated on any registration form. Users can also opt out of our services by emailing a request to [support@fellowshiptech.com](mailto:support@fellowshiptech.com).

### Changes to Privacy Policy

Fellowship Technologies will update this policy from time to time. A "last revised" date will always be included on the bottom of the statement. To keep up-to-date with Fellowship Technologies’ policy, please check this page periodically.
