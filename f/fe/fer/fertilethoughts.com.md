_**Privacy Statement for FertileThoughts**_

**FertileThoughts** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for **FertileThoughts** :

**Information Automatically Logged**

We use your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. _We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable_. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.

Since the subject matter of **FertileThoughts** is of a sensitive nature we have a very strict user's policy. In order to keep this a safe and friendly environment for our users we use the person's IP address to contact their Internet Service Provider if they are abusive. That would be the only instance in which we will link an IP address to a person.

**Cookies**

**FertileThoughts** uses cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This is done only when you enter one of the sections that require you to have a user name and a password such as the Java chatrooms. In no case are cookies used to track down users for any purpose. If you dont like usage of cookies you can easily disable it by going to "my settings". When cookies are not used the forums will be using a method called "session ID" to keep track of you during each visit. Once you leave the site no information is kept on the server or your computer. This may require you to log on manually for each visit.

**Advertisers**

We sometimes use an outside ad agency to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad agency, and we may not have access to this information.

**E-mail list**

**FertileThoughts** ' e-mail list requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). Contact information from the registration forms is used to send information about our company. The member's contact information is also used to send promotional material from some of our partners to our members.

Users can opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

**Order Forms**

**FertileThoughts** uses an order form for customers to request products and services. We collect contact information (like email and postal address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code).

Contact information from the order forms is used for shipping purposes only, or to contact the user in case a problem arises with the product /service. (For example, user’s choice is out of stock). Financial information that is collected is only used to bill the user for products and services purchased, and is not shared with third parties.

**Surveys**

Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an _aggregate_ basis. This means no identifiable information will be shared at any time - only statistical information of our members as a group. We also use this data to tailor our visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

We would like to emphasize that these companies do not influence our site content in any way, and that we closely monitor what is offered by these businesses on **FertileThoughts**.
