# Feral Interactive : Privacy Policy

| 

We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our Web site. This Privacy Policy explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. It is available for you to review on our homepage and at least on every page where we have requested personally identifiable information, including from kids under 13 years old. By using this web site, you signify your assent to the terms of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, do not use this Web site. 

### KIDS

Please check with your parents before entering any information on this or any other Web site. See our **"Special Note to Kids"** below. 

### PARENTS:

We are committed to protecting children's privacy. We developed this Web site to be an enjoyable experience for customers of all ages. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on this Web site or how this Web site operates. Please be sure to caution your child against providing personally identifiable information online prior to the web site operator obtaining your consent. It is our policy not to knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without a parent's or guardian's permission. See our **"Special Note to Parents of Kids Under 13"** below. 

Please discuss this Privacy Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use this Web site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Web site, as well as protecting our users' privacy. 

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., first name, age, state or country).  We also collect certain types of personal information such as an email address. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities, such as receiving our e-mail newsletter.

In some areas on our Web site additional personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, full name, mailing address and phone number). This collection is necessary so that our visitors can participate in certain activities, such as online sweepstakes or online promotions. You may not be able to access those areas or participate in such activities without being registered or giving us the necessary personally identifiable information. Whenever we request that you submit such personally identifiable information, we will notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below. Please be aware that we are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. You are under no obligation to provide, and can decline to provide, any requested information at any time. However, if you decline to provide personal information that is reasonably necessary to participate in certain activities, you may not be able to participate in those activities at this web site.

The types of information collected at this Web site may include: 

  * Contact information, such as full name, e-mail address and mailing address. 
  * Financial information and/or Credit/Debit Card data (for, by way of example, online store purchase)
  * Demographic information, such as date of birth, age, aggregate information, gender, state and country.
  * Internet Protocol (IP) Information, such as your IP address and browser type. 



### HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?:

**Registration:**

Our Web site's registration form requires users to give us contact information. All registration information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. Once you register, we use customer contact information from the registration form to contact you, to send you information about our company and/or to give you updates on products and/or services. You may register on our Web site and choose not to receive information and updates by unchecking the relevant box on the registration form. Kids, get your parent's or guardian's consent before you register or provide any information.

**Product Support for Feral Interactive customers:**

To send an email to Feral Interactive Ltd's ("Feral") Technical Support team regarding a problem you encounter with a Feral product, we may ask you to provide your name, email address, and information about your computer in addition to information about the product you are having trouble with. The email you provide to Feral for this purpose is used only to respond to the sender’s problem.

**Online Promotions:**

We or our licensees and/or other business partners may have special online promotions which feature products or services related to our business activities. To participate in any promotion, you must be 13 years or older (unless otherwise specified by the promotion's rules and regulations). If you are under 13 you will need your parent's or guardian's consent before you can participate in this activity. If you are 13 or older but not an adult you will need your parent's or guardian's consent to collect your prize or receive your benefit. You may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. For other promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. 

**Collecting and Sharing Data:**

The following outlines the ways we share your information. We do not share your personally identifiable information in ways other than as described in this Privacy Policy. We sometimes collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate demographic and non-personal information you provide and use such aggregate information to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our product offerings.

We also use third-party service providers to assist in our service offerings. Such providers may include a credit card processing company, an outside shipping agent to fulfill delivery of orders, and an email service provider to facilitate our e-mailings. We will share your personal information with these types of third parties to facilitate functions on our behalf, even if you are under age 13. We require these companies to limit their use of your personally identifiable information to the purpose of fulfilling their services to us.

In some instances, such as when making a purchase using MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa, you may be directed to the service provider's Web site to conduct the transaction by entering in your personally identifiable information. Although these pages may have the look and feel of the Feral Web site, please be aware that you are actually submitting your information directly to that service provider to fulfill your request.

Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information (including the personal information of those under 13) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal processes; respond to any claims; or, protect the rights, property or personal safety of Feral Interactive Ltd., its subsidiaries and affiliates, our customers or the public. In addition, information about our customers, including, without limitation personal information regarding customers under 13, may be disclosed as part of any bankruptcy, merger, sale, transfer of company assets or acquisition. In the instance of a bankruptcy, merger, sale or transfer of company assets we will attempt to notify you. Please see our **“CHANGES”** section below.

**Opinions:**

We may offer fully interactive registered email services. Our newsletters may include links to independently operated Web sites. Although we do not provide any personally identifiable information about kids under 13 to any "independently-operated Web site" (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled and operated by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under 13. Please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies) or terms of use. If you are under 13, you will need your parent's or guardian's consent before you can participate in these activities.
