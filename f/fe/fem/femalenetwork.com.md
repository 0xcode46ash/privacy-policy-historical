# Privacy Policy | FemaleNetwork.com

**Female Network** is defined as all websites, web pages, forums (GIRLTalk) and channels owned, controlled and/or operated by Summit Media.

We frequently provide information and links to third-party advertisers or partners. Information on how to access the privacy practices of these third parties is included below as well

We will notify our members when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that may affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. We will not make new use of any personally identifiable information which Female Network gathered from individual members or visitors prior to any such significant change in our Privacy Policy without first obtaining the member's or visitor's consent for any new uses. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and we tell you the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with unaffiliated third parties, and in cases where a member, visitor or subscriber to Female Network opts-in to share his/her information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. In addition, Female Network reserves the right to make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect Female Network’s use of a user's personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on Female Network. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. Please note that this Privacy Policy is also incorporated into Female Network’s Terms of Service.

## Female Network gathers two basic types of information:

  * **Information provided to** Female Network: In order to use many of Female Network’s features, tools and services, we ask you to register to become a member. During this member registration process, we will ask for your personally identifiable information such as your name, mobile/phone number, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, birth date, age, member name, and password. In addition, you may choose to provide Female Network with additional information including marital status, household income, education, and employment status. Female Network uses the information it gathers for several purposes, such as to understand more about our audience's interests, to communicate with you better, and to give you a better experience when visiting Female Network by personalizing tools, content, services, and email messages (more details below). Female Network also uses this information to build new services and develop offers that Female Network believes are more relevant and valuable to you. Female Network, its advertisers, and partners may ask you for 
  * **Information gathered by** Female Network: When you visit Female Network and interact with the services and tools that reside there, Female Network and third parties with whom Female Network has contracted to provide services to Female Network may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources: one is from the server log files and the other is from cookies. 



## How information is collected and disseminated

The information collected by Female Network is used to create aggregated portraits of the Female Network audience, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs and to also supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand who the Female Network audience is. For example, we may create a report that tells advertisers that 60 percent of our members are females in a certain age range, so that they can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our members. 

In order to better describe how information is collected and disseminated, please carefully review the list below.

Many areas of Female Network are reserved for Female Network members who have registered with us; for example, forums, sending in questions to the editorial team, voting for **polls** , and access to special offers and promos. This is necessary so that Female Network can assure the quality of its forums. Registration is free. 

The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name and password and provide Female Network with your first and last names, email address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, age, and birth date. The form also includes optional information that you may choose to provide to us like marital status, household income, education and employment status. 

The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be given to unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the limited circumstances described in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled "Information Sharing Policy". 

Throughout Female Network, various public forums are available to you as a registered member of Female Network. Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to Female Network, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information and/or issuing your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding a certain story or topic, or even photos. Female Network may decide to utilize the content of forums and interactions with experts throughout Female Network and in promotions in order to enhance Female Network’s editorial, advertising, promotional and similar activities. In those cases we often provide authorship credit by listing the author's member name. We therefore encourage you to use care in protecting your identity when you choose a member name and to keep your member name confidential. 

We regularly operate contests and other promos throughout Female Network. We typically ask you for your email address and mobile/phone number (to notify you if you've won or not). We also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses in order to verify the entrant's identity. In some situations, we need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. This information is shared with an unaffiliated third party: 

  * When you choose to receive information from a third party promo sponsor;
  * When a contest or promo is hosted by Female Network but administered by a sponsor, again, we will advise you of this in the contest or promo rules; or
  * Most contests and other promos will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for tax purposes if you become a winner.



You should carefully review the rules of each contest and promo which you enter as they may contain additional important information about Female Network’s or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information. 

Female Network offers the ability to forward an article to another person via email. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the article or postcard and we will also ask for your email address. We do not use the recipient's email address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so. 

Female Network contains links to advertiser and partner websites. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such non- Female Network websites, and we do not control the practices of any of our advertisers or partners to whom we are linked. However, we generally will advise you when you are leaving Female Network through a link and when that advertiser's or partner's Privacy Policy controls the collection and dissemination of the information you provide. 

In order to participate in the partner and/or advertiser supplied services and tools, you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to the advertisers and partners whose tools and services you have chosen to interact with. Each advertiser and partner will request different information from you. 

In any instance where personally identifiable information is required to be provided to or shared with Female Network advertisers and partners, Female Network generally will advise you when such advertiser or partner will receive your personally identifiable information and further advise you as to which Privacy Policy will control the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information you provide. Female Network will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third party advertisers and partners to agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

The information you provide via links to co-branded pages, co-branded sites, third party sites or tools may be shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregated basis and in these instances your permission will not be requested since no personally identifiable information will be shared or provided to these third party sponsors or advertisers. Female Network will, however, use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all such third-party advertisers and partners to agree not to use any non-personally identifiable information about you, in conjunction with other sources of information, or otherwise, to identify you. 

If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners, or sponsors use information about you, we urge you to contact them directly. 

Female Network does not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent except in the following instances: (i) unless required by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in Female Network’s discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of Female Network, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in the event Female Network is required to transfer personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of Female Network or its affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In addition, Female Network reserves the right to allow access to its systems to third parties providing necessary technical services when such access is required in order to provide those services and to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties who provide services on behalf of Female Network, provided that such third parties are bound by Female Network’s Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that Female Network reserves the right to share any personally identifiable or other information about you which you provide to (or which is gathered by) Female Network with any or all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and will also have access to any such information which you provide to (or which is gathered by) the web sites of any of our Affiliates. 

Upon registration or from time-to-time, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers or news about our sites and advertisers. You will also be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from select companies other than Female Network. If you do choose to receive these communications by means of an opt-in, we will occasionally send you an email message that matches your request(s). You may, of course, always choose not to receive any of this information from us. We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities: 

  * Upon registration, you can choose to receive no communications from us other than an initial member welcome message. 
  * At any time, you can follow a link provided in every newsletter or email message to unsubscribe from that mailing list or email service.
  * At any time, you can contact us by email to have your contact preference changed to "Unsubscribe."



Please note that Female Network reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Female Network Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy. 

At any time, you can opt out of having your personally identifiable information shared with our Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. 

Female Network provides you with the ability to access, correct, or change certain information in your member portrait at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. However, you cannot currently change your member name although you may re-register and choose a new name. Please be advised that Female Network currently archives information it collects on its members and visitors. 

Female Network has numerous security measures in place to protect you from the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All of your member information require use of your password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. 

Female Network uses industry-standard tools, such as firewalls, to ensure that your information is secure and confidential.
