# Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Federal Employee Plan - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association maintains high standards for the protection of your privacy on our Web sites. Here is what you can expect when you visit [www.fepblue.org](http://www.fepblue.org/)

  * Other than to fulfill a request from you, we won't sell, rent or share any personally-identifiable information you provide without your consent. 
  * We won't send you any unsolicited e-mail ("spam").
  * No personally-identifiable information (PII) collected at this site will ever be used to affect your health insurance coverage by or premiums paid to a Blue Cross and Blue Shield company.



Please remember that this policy only covers the data collection and use practices for fepblue.org, an official Web site of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. BCBSA's privacy policies may differ at its other Web sites or in its off-line data collection and reporting practices. Questions regarding the privacy policy of your independent, local Blue Cross and Blue Shield company should be directed to that company.

Each of our business partners, including Caremark (Pharmacy Programs), Medco (Pharmacy Programs), McKesson (Blue Health Connection), the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), our enrollment area (the FEP Operations Center for Customer eService), Mondial Access or World Access for overseas benefit and provider information, and any other supplemental plan vendor, have separate privacy policies. Please read these policies when you access the Web sites of our business partners from this Web site.

Our web servers automatically capture your domain name, the IP address of the web page from which you enter our site, the pages you visit on our site and the amount of time you spend here. We do not collect any information that can reveal your personal identity unless you voluntarily provide it when you register to use interactive features of the site or to receive information from us or our member Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies ("Blue Plans"). We do not collect and save any Protected Health Information (PHI). Any section of fepblue.org that is directed to children or teens will be protected by a screening mechanism to help ensure parental consent is obtained before we collect or use personal information from children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or use information from children under 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian.

Personally-identifiable information voluntarily provided by you may be retained indefinitely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

If you use the features on this Web site or on the Web sites of our Business Partners, you are "opting in" and agree to our collection of information as described above. You can "opt out" or prevent us from collecting PHI or PII by not using the interactive features of this Web site or the Web sites of our Business Partners. You may "opt in" or "opt out" each time you access the Web site. If you "opt out", you cannot use the interactive features, such as the Provider Directory and Pharmacy Programs.

The non-personally identifiable information we gather and store in aggregate form is only used to maintain or improve our Web site, and we may share that information with other areas in BCBSA, local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, our Business Partners, or with companies we hire to help us maintain or improve the Web site. 

Any personally-identifiable information you voluntarily give us will be stored in a secure environment and used only to provide the product, service, or information you have requested or for which you registered. Unless you specifically consent to let us do so, your personally-identifiable information, including your e-mail address, will not be sold, rented, licensed or otherwise shared with third parties, other than our member Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans or Business Partners as required to fulfill a request from you. Personal information you voluntarily provide and the non-personally identifiable information we collect in aggregate form will not affect your insurance coverage, eligibility, premiums or claims payment by any Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan.

When you visit our Web site, we may place a "session" or cookie on your computer that will allow us to customize and enhance your experience at fepblue.org, make improvements to our Web site, or to report site activity. Our session cookies will not permanently store on your computer and expire when you leave our site. Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third party Web sites or to send spam, nor will our cookies provide us with any personally identifiable information about you.

We will store cookie information only in aggregate form and only use the information to make improvements to the Web site or internal reports on site activity. You can use your browser controls to refuse to allow any cookies to be placed on your computer.

Spyware is software that helps gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, and which may send information to another entity without your consent, or asserts control over a computer without your knowledge.

At this time, we do not use cookies or spyware on our site.

If you choose to use any of the links we provide to our member companies, sponsors, and other third party resources, you will be leaving our Web site and going to a new Web site. Protection of your privacy at those other sites will be governed by the privacy policy at that site. Please take the time to read the privacy policies at their sites. We have business relationships with the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, Caremark, Medco, McKesson, OPM, Mondial Access or World Access, supplemental benefit companies, and the FEP Operations Center. These linking relationships are not a form of advertising or promotion, but part of the unique set of benefits available under the Service Benefit Plan and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of Plans. Nor are the links to other sites within our Web site of an advertising or promotional nature.

If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will let you know the effective date of the changes and provide a tool for you to understand what has changed.

## Glossary of Terms:

A Web site may gather individual pieces of non-personal Information from the individuals who use the Web site. The Web site may combine similar data from many or all of the users of the Web site into one data category. For example, all of the users who accessed the Pharmacy Programs feature on our Web site. The combined data or aggregate data does not identify each user, but provides the total number of times the Pharmacy Programs was accessed from www.fepblue.org during a specific time period.

On [www.fepblue.org](http://www.fepblue.org/), we collect aggregate data to monitor what features are accessed on our Web site and monitor what features are most useful to our members.

A Cookie is a small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a Web site. Normally, Cookies are used by the Web site owner or advertisers on the site to help make the site easier to use or track usage on that site or other sites where the advertiser may have a presence as well. For example, if a password and user ID are needed to sign into a Web site and there is a box for you to check to store your password for future use, your password is stored in a Cookie on your computer.

We do not use Cookies on [www.fepblue.org](http://www.fepblue.org/).

This is information that cannot be traced back to any individual user and cannot be used to identify the individual user.

If you "opt-in", it means that you are actively indicating your selection of a feature on this Web site. Usually, it also means you must provide certain information, such as your ZIP code, ID number, or address, to use the selected feature. For example, if you use our online Provider Directory to locate a provider near where you live, you must enter at least your zip code to use this feature. When you use an interactive feature and enter personal information, you are opting-in for that feature.

If you "opt-out," it means that you have to take some action to avoid the collection of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PII). To "opt-out" on our Web site, you are choosing not to use any interactive feature or feature that allows us to collect PII or PHI. For example, when you opt-out, you cannot use our Provider Directory, Pharmacy Programs or other features that ask you to enter information.

When your Personally Identifiable information (PII) is combined with your known health conditions, the information becomes Personal Health Information.

This is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and Social Security Number.
