# FeedBlitz Privacy Policy

You have the right to control your personal information. 

We also want to present information to you that is tailored your needs. For this reason, we ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of the site, or subscribe to a mailing list or blog feed. We use the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide are tailored to your current and future needs. We may also track your activity (the pages you visit) on our web site using cookies in order for us to improve the Internet presence. No information about your subscriptions, activities or any personally identifiable information we collect is shared outside the company, with the exception of the owners of the feeds you subscribe to (see below). 

If you register with the site, or opt in to receiving notifications when providing personal information, FeedBlitz may use your mailing address, telephone number, or email address to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services. If you request it, we will cease to contact you using one or more of these methods. 

## Email Addresses, Publishers and Subscriptions

When you subscribe to a feed published using the FeedBlitz, we _will_ share your email address with the publisher of that feed, but with nobody else. You may set your profile preferences to be anonymous to stop such notifications. 

Your email address will never otherwise be shared by FeedBlitz with third parties. To prevent spamming, we required all new subscription requests to be confirmed via email before they are activated. 

## Cookies

FeedBlitz requires cookies to function. Cookies are used to ensure the correct functioning of the service we provide. We use cookies only for this purpose. If you disable cookies in your browser you will be unable to use FeedBlitz services. 

FeedBlitz will not permit third-party cookies to track your activity on the FeedBlitz web site. FeedBlitz is not responsible for cookies used by content providers in the feeds we circulate, however. 

## Server Logs

The FeedBlitz web server and parts of the FeedBlitz application log activity to file. We use logs to provide site-wide reporting, to ensure smooth operation of the services FeedBlitz delivers, and for general web site and application maintenance. Like almost all Internet servers, logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the page(s) you visit. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information (e.g. "we had 1,234 visitors yesterday"). We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.
