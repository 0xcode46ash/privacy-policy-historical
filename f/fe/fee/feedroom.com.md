# The FeedRoom - About Us - Leadership

The FeedRoom strives to protect the privacy and security of all its users, email subscribers, and sweepstakes entrants. Please read the ensuing policy to understand how we will treat the personal information that you give to us. Our privacy procedures include the following:

3\. We allow all users to opt out at any time from receiving e-mail messages from The FeedRoom as well as its sponsors and business partners.

This policy may change as procedures and requirements evolve, and as we modify or expand our business. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of how, when and under what circumstances we collect, use and disclose your personal data. In addition, if you so elect, we will send you an email whenever we make such changes to this policy. Your continued use of The FeedRoom is your agreement to any such changes.

It is important to be aware that our website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. This privacy policy only applies to information collected from you on The FeedRoom.

REGISTRATION DATA:  
During sweepstakes or email registration, The FeedRoom may collect personally identifiable information that includes your name, address, email address, birth date, gender, and phone number. Once you provide this data to The FeedRoom, you are no longer anonymous. You do not have to provide any personal information to enter The FeedRoom. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you will not be registered and you will not be entered into The FeedRoom sweepstakes. In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other services dependent upon the collection of such data, such as discounts from our sponsors.

What are cookies and how does The FeedRoom use them?

COOKIES:  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

USER CHOICES ABOUT COOKIES:  
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. In order to use the FeedRoom and enter its sweepstakes, we recommend that our users surf, with cookies turned on.

THE FEEDROOM USES ITS OWN COOKIES FOR A NUMBER OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING TO:  
1\. Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using FeedRoom services.  
2\. Display the most appropriate advertising, based on your interests and activity on FeedRoom.  
3\. Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.  
4\. Conduct research to improve The FeedRoom's content and services.  
5\. The FeedRoom uses cookies to track user entries in its sweepstakes.

OTHER COMPANIES' COOKIES ON THE FEEDROOM:  
1\. Please note that the FeedRoom allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages, or serving email newsletters, to set and access their cookies on your computer.  
2\. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the FeedRoom Privacy Policy.

OTHER DATA COLLECTED:  
Periodically, The FeedRoom may collect additional personal data about you as well as aggregate information on entrants. This may include:  
1\. Information you provide when registering to receive goods or services from one or more of our partners.  
2\. Information you provide when entering a contest, sweepstakes or promotion sponsored by The FeedRoom and/or one of our partners.  
3\. Information you provide when filling out a user survey.  
4\. Information you provide if you contact our customer service center.

6\. Data related to the areas of The FeedRoom that you visited and how much you frequent those areas. This includes the co-branded sections of The FeedRoom that are a part of our overall business.  
7\. The FeedRoom may also collect information at other times.

How does The FeedRoom use personal information?  
The FeedRoom uses the information that you supply us to enhance your FeedRoom experience through personalization and by providing you with special opportunities that we think you will find valuable. We also use anonymous, aggregated data to study site traffic patterns. Such information allows us to further personalize our offerings to you through advertising and promotions.  
We also use your registration data in connection with The FeedRoom sweepstakes in order to track your progress, to notify you if you are a winner, and to ensure that we comply with state and federal laws.  
Regarding our personalized offerings, The FeedRoom uses the data it collects among other things, to:  
1\. Provide your personal information to selected third parties unless you have opted not to permit such sharing.  
2\. Provide you with advertising, email newsletters, and other promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you.  
3\. Contact users for feedback regarding The FeedRoom and The FeedRoom's partners via email surveys.  
We may also use the aggregate data we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers. A report may specify that, "100,000 people clicked on this link and of those people, 15% were registered users below the age of 25." We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have given us your permission.  
Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers or emails from selected third parties, we also may provide a report to our advertisers which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email offering you a discount on a particular service. If you click on that e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the information necessary to provide you with that discount.  


What is The FeedRoom's policy regarding children's privacy?  
The FeedRoom is committed to the safety of children. Children under the age of 18 may not participate in The FeedRoom sweepstakes or promotions. If children under 18 continue to use The FeedRoom, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to the site, or sending personal information to anyone on line.  
1\. The FeedRoom will not request or knowingly collect from a child any information that can be traced to the child, such as an email address, name or information about the child's family.  
2\. The FeedRoom will not knowingly use personal information from children under the age of 13 for any marketing or promotional purposes.  
3\. The FeedRoom will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate that they are under the age of 13.

What choices are available to entrants regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personal information, and how can an entrant opt-out?  
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information simply by clicking on the opt-out button, or by not filling out the sweepstakes entrance form. Although keeping your data private will not prevent you from using The FeedRoom, keep in mind that you must provide some personally identifiable information in order to participate in The FeedRoom sweepstakes.  
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from The FeedRoom or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to edit your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information, send us an email with your request. If you elect to "opt out" we will not share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, The FeedRoom may continue using your data for internal purposes, to conduct sweepstakes and promotions, to enhance our site or to comply with state and federal laws.  


Who has access to your personally identifiable information?  
Your sweepstakes registration data is accessible only to The FeedRoom. The FeedRoom takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use these services at your own risk.  


How and when is information disclosed to third parties?  
The FeedRoom does not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without giving you the opportunity to opt out, except in special situations described in the following paragraph. However, The FeedRoom may disclose certain aggregate data to third parties. As mentioned earlier, examples of aggregate data would consist of the following: "26% of users link to Company X" or "73% of users are female." Such aggregate data will in no way identify you personally.

Administering the site and compliance with the law: The FeedRoom may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with state and federal law, a subpoena, or other legal process. The FeedRoom may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the public. In addition, The FeedRoom may access account information for administrative and other purposes that we believe to be necessary to the development, maintenance and improvement of our business, such as to better customize the site based upon your preferences.

Sweepstakes, promotions and sponsorships: The FeedRoom may disclose your personal information to selected companies, including sponsors of promotions or sweepstakes available through The FeedRoom, unless you opt out during sweepstakes registration or by editing your preferences. Special sponsor promotions may often involve a request for additional information. By submitting this additional information, you give The FeedRoom permission to transfer this information to the sponsors so they can fulfill your request or administer the promotion. You should review any applicable sweepstakes and promotion rules or user agreement to see what is being shared. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will disclose this to you either before we collect or transfer the data.  
The FeedRoom may use publicly available consumer data to present you with special advertising offers and promotions. In such instances, The FeedRoom DOES NOT give out your personally identifiable information to the party providing the public data. Under confidentiality agreements that do not permit reuse or disclosure, The FeedRoom may match your user information with third party data. We might occasionally do this to help determine whether a particular offer or promotion will be of interest to our users.

Email newsletter subscriptions: The FeedRoom may collect email and personally identifiable information in order to distribute targeted, promotional email newsletters for The FeedRoom web sites. This information is disclosed to third-party ad serving and email delivery solutions for the purpose of optimizing your experience on The FeedRoom. You reserve the right to "unsubscribe" from The FeedRoom email subscriber list at any time.
