# The FeedRoom | The Feedroom Privacy Policy

Updated March 20, 2009

We at The FeedRoom, Inc. are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you share with us. The FeedRoom has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information. 

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit The FeedRoom’s Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. 

Our privacy procedures include the following:

  * We give full disclosure of our privacy policies and procedures
  * We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to anyone without your permission
  * We allow all users to opt out at any time from receiving email messages from The FeedRoom as well as its sponsors and business partners
  * We allow users to access their user profiles and change their information whenever they want



This policy may change as procedures and requirements evolve, and as we modify or expand our business. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of how, when and under what circumstances we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information. In addition, if you so elect, we will send you an email whenever we make such changes to this policy. Your continued use of [http://www.feedroom.com](http://www.feedroom.com/) is your agreement to any such changes.

It is important to be aware that our Web site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites. This privacy policy only applies to information collected from you on [http://www.feedroom.com](http://www.feedroom.com/).

## Use of Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within The FeedRoom or to The FeedRoom’s third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

The FeedRoom strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, The FeedRoom intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred or retained.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. 

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site. 

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; click-stream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

  * Notice
  * Choice
  * Security 
  * Access/Accuracy 



## Notice

Where The FeedRoom collects Personal Information on the Web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether we plan to share such Personal Information outside of The FeedRoom or those working on The FeedRoom’s behalf.  The FeedRoom does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on The FeedRoom’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required.

## Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to The FeedRoom. The notice we intend to provide where The FeedRoom collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of The FeedRoom’s Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services that involve our interaction with you. 

If you chose to have a relationship with The FeedRoom, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

## Security

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within The FeedRoom or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## Access/Accuracy

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, The FeedRoomn wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting The FeedRoom should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to [info@feedroom.com](mailto:info@feedroom.com) and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable.

## Third-Party Services

Third parties provide certain services on The FeedRoom’s behalf. The FeedRoom may provide information, including Personal Information, that The FeedRoom collects on the Web to third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information and services. Service providers are also an important means by which The FeedRoom maintains its Web site and mailing lists. The FeedRoom will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on The FeedRoom’s behalf. 

The FeedRoom does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on The FeedRoom’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against The FeedRoom’s policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.

## Children’s Privacy

Feedroom.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.

## Commitment

We are committed to privacy and, through our membership in the Online Privacy Alliance, are actively involved in and support current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and The FeedRoom’s Web sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands. 

If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy Policy, please contact us at [info@feedroom.com](mailto:info@feedroom.com). While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.

## Your Consent

By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to The FeedRoom’s processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where The FeedRoom collects Personal Information on the Web. Should the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time. 

All questions regarding this privacy policy should be directed to The FeedRoom, Inc.
