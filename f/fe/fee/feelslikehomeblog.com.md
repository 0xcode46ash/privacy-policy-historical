# Privacy Policy | food, recipes, tutorials,

Like most website operators, Feels Like Home collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. My purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how you use this website. From time to time, I may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this website.

Feels Like Home also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. I do not use such information to identify visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that I use and disclose other personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Some visitors to Feels Like Home choose to interact in ways that require me to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that I gather depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Feels Like Home collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the site. I do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Feels Like Home may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Feels Like Home may reveal how many times a particular post was viewed, or say which browsers are most popular for viewing the site. However, Feels Like Home does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Feels Like Home discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on my behalf or to provide services available at this site, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using this site, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Feels Like Home will _**never**_ rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Feels Like Home discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Feels Like Home, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of Feels Like Home have supplied your email address, I may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with here.

If you send me an email, I reserve the right to publish it in order to help other readers.

Feels Like Home visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using this sites, with the drawback that certain features of the site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
