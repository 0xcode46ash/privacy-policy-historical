The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy when using this Web site (the "Site"). Our relationship will be one of respect and consideration.

#### _Overview of our commitment to your privacy:_

  * We will never sell your personal information to any unaffiliated third party without your consent.
  * Your privacy will be respected and the confidentiality of your answers will be maintained as described in this Policy. 
  * Your name, address, phone number, personal information, and individual responses will only be used as described in this Policy and will not otherwise be disclosed to anyone without your permission. 
  * We will clearly represent to you what we are doing through our Site. 
  * We will maintain high standards of professional conduct in the collection and reporting of the information you provide. 



#### _Information Usage:_

We will only collect, use or retain personal information (such as your name, email address, phone number and other information that specifically identifies you or that is linked to identifiable information about you) that you voluntarily provide to us through Site interactions, email or other forms of communication. We will only collect, use or retain your personal information for the following reasons: (1) internally at AICPA to directly contact you regarding the service or respond to your questions sent to us; (2) to compile the aggregate information described above; (3) to provide you with information, such as updates to this Site, that we think may be of interest to you; (4) we may merge your personal information, along with any other information you may provide to us at any time and/or any other information that we may receive about you from any sources, online or offline, at any time; (5) to share it with our affiliates; or (6) if required to release personal information because of a court order, government agency or by law.

We will never sell your personal information to any unaffiliated third party without your consent; however, information may be transferred to another company if there is a sale or merger of AICPA or the division responsible for these services. 

#### _Cookie:_

We reserve the right to utilize cookie technology. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain various types of information, including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. We may use cookies to enhance your experience on this Site, to determine user traffic patterns and for other purposes. 

#### _Security:_

In order to certify that our panelist information is kept private, AICPA has implemented a state-of-the-art, industry standard firewall security system. This system uses a multi-stage inspection methodology, which ensures that only authenticated users can input their information into the database system and only AICPA, its database managers and their respective agents are allowed to read it. Though we make reasonable efforts to protect the security of your information and our system, no transmission via the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, you assume that risk by using our Site or responding to our emails. 

#### _Links to Other Web Sites:_

This Site contains links to other Web sites. Note that when you click on one of these links, you are moving to another Web site that AICPA does not control. AICPA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. AICPA encourages you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information, as these sites have privacy policies that differ from ours. AICPA is not responsible for the content of any off-site pages or Web sites linked to these Web pages. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. 

#### _Changes to policy:_

We reserve the right to change, add, or remove portions from this Policy at any time. However, if any change involves a plan to use your personal information in a way that differs from this Policy, we will first send you an email notice link. 

#### _Site Privacy Conditions:_

Use of this Site is governed by the stipulations set forth in the Privacy Policy. Your use, or access, of the Site constitutes your agreement of the Privacy provisions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE PRIVACY POLICIES, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE.
