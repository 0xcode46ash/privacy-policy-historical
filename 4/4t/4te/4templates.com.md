# Privacy Policy - 4Templates.com

Cookies

Cookies are small data files that websites can write to your hard drive when you visit them. Once written, the cookie can only be accessed by the site that originally created it (ie. our site cannot read cookies set by another site you have visited and vice-versa). Our site uses cookies to store personal site preferences, session information, and ordering information specific to you (such as the contents of your shopping cart). 

External Site Links

This site contains links to other websites on the internet. While we provide links to them, we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. 

Advertisers

Some of the advertisements on our site are provided by outside advertisement companies and may contain cookies. While we use cookies on our site, the cookies associated with these advertisements are collected by their respective companies and are therefore not accessible to us. 

IP Addresses and Logging

Our server logs information regarding visitors to our site, such as IP address, date/time, and pages accessed. This information is used to generate reports for statistical purposes. 

Customer Information

Information, such as billing names, billing addresses and email addresses, are collected from customers at the time of a sale in order to complete the purchase. This information is **NOT** sold to, distributed to, or shared with third parties. We are firmly against spam and neither participate nor promote any activities that assist spammers. 

Credit Card Transactions

All credit card transactions are securely processed through [Authorize.Net](http://www.authorizenet.com/). Complete credit card numbers, expiration dates, and card security codes are processed and stored only by Authorize.Net and are **NOT** stored by us in any fashion. We may, however, store the last four digits of credit card numbers and additional billing information (such as billing names and addresses) for the purpose of fraud detection and prevention.
