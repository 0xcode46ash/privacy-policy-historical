**Privacy Policy  
**4Kids.TV ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY _General Privacy Policy Statement:_   
4Kids Entertainment, Inc. ("4Kids" or "we"), the owner of the 4Kids.TV (website (the "Website"), recognizes its obligation to its customers, community, online visitors and subscribers (collectively "Users" or "You") to adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in all of its operations. 4Kids is dedicated to protecting consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for children. We have developed our privacy practices in compliance with the requirements established by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and make every effort to comply with the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU). _General Website Online Privacy Policy Applicable to Users 13 and over:_  
The policy set forth below is applicable to Users of the Website who are 13 and over.

4Kids collects personally identifiable information from a User only during 

(i) Contest or sweepstakes registrations  
(ii) subscription registrations  
(iii) My 4Kids registrations   
(iv) online shopping and  
(v) surveys

In addition, information is collected in certain sections of the Website in which a User specifically and knowingly provides such information to 4Kids such as in chat rooms or on bulletin boards. 4Kids may use such information for a variety of purposes, including fulfillment and the development of editorial content and marketing and promotional campaigns for the Website.

In the event that 4Kids plans to post any such information on the Website, Users shall be provided with prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting. If a User objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use--either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her Registration information online.

If a User wishes to modify their registration information or stop receiving e-mail updates from the Website, the user must log onto their account at <http://www.4kids.tv/forum/profile.php?do=editprofile>. Their account can be modified from the noted profile page. An account can also be deleted at any time under control panel options “delete account” also on the profile page. Users can also unsubscribe to any e-mails sent to them by simply clicking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email sent.  Parents or Users can also e-mail 4Kids at [_webmaster@4kids.tv_ ](mailto:unsubscribe@foxbox.tv) or contact 4Kids at 1-212-758-7666 with any problems or questions.

_Special Privacy Policy for Users Under 13:_   
4Kids has a Special Privacy Policy for Users under 13 that is set forth below:   
(i) 4Kids encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on various websites.   
(ii) Except as provided in subparagraphs (iv)-(viii) below, 4Kids does not collect personally identifiable information about any User under 13. Except as provided in subparagraphs (iv)-(viii), no information collected from any User under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purpose whatsoever, either inside or outside the Website. The e-mail address of a User under 13 is never posted on the Website.   
(iii) For some activities, such as online polls or surveys, we may ask a User under 13 to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include the User's first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or favorite 4Kids TV character.   
(iv) Except as provided below in subparagraphs (v) and (vii), 4Kids does not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under 13 without (x) notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's e-mail address and any other information pertaining to the child from the applicable database for that activity or (y) obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent. A parent or guardian may permit a User under 13 to participate in activities on our Website without consenting to the disclosure of the User under 13's personally identifiable information to third parties. No personally identifying information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by any User under 13 years of age without the consent of such User's parent or guardian. 

4Kids will obtain such consent from a parent of a User under 13, by requiring a parent or legal guardian to (1) send 4Kids a signed consent form via e-mail, fax or regular mail or, (2) All registrants shall receive an e-mail confirming their registration at the Website. Parents or Legal Guardians always have the option of calling us at 1-212-758-7666 or e-mailing us at [_webmaster@4kids.tv_ ](mailto:comments@foxbox.tv) with any questions or problems with regards to consent.

(v) 4Kids will not request from any User under 13, and 4Kids does not condition the participation of any User under 13 in any contest or other activity on the Website on, the disclosure by the User under 13 of more personal information than is reasonably required for such User under 13 to participate in such contest or activity. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes or contest once by e-mail. If any User under 13 wins the contest, the User under 13 will be contacted and asked for parental contact information. Notification and prizes will be sent to the User under 13 's parent or guardian. 4Kids keeps any personally identifiable information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes only until we have successfully selected the winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and completed the administration of the contest or sweepstakes as legally required and such information will not be used for any other purpose. We will not publish the names, ages, images or other personally identifiable information of any contest winner under 13 without first obtaining the consent of such contest winner's parent or guardian.  
(vi) For any periodic newsletters offered by the Website, we collect a participant's first name, e-mail address, and his or her parent's e-mail address. We then send an e-mail notification to the parent asking permission. If the parent wishes to deny permission for the child's receipt of any newsletter from the Website, the parent simply needs to reply to the e-mail within 72 hours of receipt. Otherwise, the parent will be deemed to have approved the child's receipt of the newsletter. A parent or User can, at any time, be removed from the newsletter mailing list by following the instructions at the bottom of the newsletter. If such a removal request is made (or if the parent denies permission from the outset), any personal information collected for the newsletter subscription is deleted from our database.   
(vii) For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend, we may also ask for personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted when the requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted.  
(viii) We will disclose information we maintain as required by law, such as, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.

_About IP Addresses_  
4Kids collects IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to report information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the User's computer whenever the User is surfing the Web. When a User request pages from the Website, our servers log the Users' IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that a User's session will be logged, but the User remains anonymous to us. _Use of Cookies: The 4Kids Cookies Policy_  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for a User by saving the User's passwords, purchases, and preferences. A cookie lets the computer remember that a User has registered, which allows us to speed up such User's future activities at our Website. Similarly, any Website store may use a temporary cookie to track which products a User has chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting the cookie do the record keeping saves the User the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. You may occasionally get cookies from our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers. The Ad Server cookie is only used to track frequency limits on the ads. No personally identifiable information is stored on the Ad Server cookie. 4Kids does not control the cookies of our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers, and these cookies are not subject to the 4Kids cookie policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by Ad Servers or third party advertisers is standard in the Internet industry. The use of cookies is an Industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major web sites. By showing how and when a User uses the Website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on such data. _How the Website Does Not use Cookies_  
The Website never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Website does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes; nor is that information shared with any third parties. The Website does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie may allow you to enter a contest without registering again each time). 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of the Website, such as any shopping, contest, and game area, may not function properly if you set your computer to refuse cookies. 

_Links to Other Sites_  
The Website may contain banner advertisements or other links to other sites not controlled by 4Kids. These other sites may send their own cookies to Users, collect data or solicit personal information. 4Kids and its affiliates are not responsible for any failure on the part of any linked websites to comply with any privacy policy posted on our Website or for any violation by such other websites of any contractual or other legal obligation to which the operator(s) of such linked website may be subject. In addition, other websites which may contain material not suitable for children, may also link to the Website without our knowledge or consent. The Website will clearly display a "bumper" page to identify to children and parents when they are leaving the Website and entering an advertiser’s site. The bumper is a reminder to children to never give out information online without getting permission from a parent or legal guardian.  _Chatrooms, Bulletin Boards:_  
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online-(for example, via message boards or chatrooms); that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While 4Kids strives to protect its Users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. Users under 13 may not participate in chatrooms or bulletin boards without prior verifiable parental consent. _4Kids Security Policy_  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with Users is of utmost concern to us. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs and third parties assisting us in the programming and maintenance of the Website are allowed access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. Further, 4Kids does not sell, rent or otherwise give personal information collected on its websites to third parties. _Co-Branded Micro Sites_  
Web pages and/or micro websites included within the Website may be co-branded with third party names, logos, and/or properties. These micro websites are operated or maintained by 4Kids. While such third parties are sponsors of these Web pages or micro websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those Web pages or micro websites. _Your Acceptance of These Terms_  
By using this Website, you signify your consent to and agreement with the Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Website. 

The Website's content and features may be updated, reviewed, modified and supplemented. 4Kids reserves the right to change the information, features, products, policies, promotions, disclosures and disclaimers at any time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website. Please check the policy periodically for changes. At the end of the Privacy Policy, we indicate the date of an update to the Privacy Policy. A User's continued use of the Websites after the posting of such changes will mean that the User has accepted such changes. Any parental or guardian consent provided to 4Kids will be deemed to apply to the revised Privacy Policy and new or modified features of the Website, unless there is a material change in our data collection, use or disclosure practices, in which case we will obtain a new consent.
