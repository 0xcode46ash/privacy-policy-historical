We do not ship C.O.D. orders to a P.O. Box, APO, or FPO.

We have no control over value-added taxes or duty charges. These are the responsibility of the customer. All special orders and all foreign sales are final. **We accept no backorders on foreign orders.**

**Damaged Shipments**  
Upon receipt of an obviously damaged package, you have the option of refusing delivery and the order will be returned to Four Wheel Drive Hardware. Or, you may receive the order and make note of the visible damage, in writing, to the carrier. If, upon inspection of the parts, you find them damaged due to the carriers handling, you then have 48 hours to file a formal claim with the carrier. **DO NOT RETURN THE DAMAGED PARTS TO US.** Keep the package and parts as close as possible to the condition in which you received them. Without the package, the carrier will void your claim. Claims for shortages due to carrier negligence must be made within five (5) working days of receipt of merchandise. Please notify our customer service department as to what has occurred so that we may assist you and answer any questions you may have on your claim.

**Refused Shipments**  
Any customer who refuses a C.O.D. delivery of an order (damaged shipment excluded) will be required to pay the additional return freight charges. These charges must be paid in full before any future orders will be shipped.

**Return Authorization**  
At your discretion, you may return all or part of any order for up to 30 days after the original ship date. All returns, however, must be made within the before mentioned 30 days. This includes flawed or incorrect merchandise. **NO EXCEPTIONS!** Any merchandise to be returned to Four Wheel Drive Hardware, **must have a Return Authorization Number (RGA#)** issued by our Customer Service Department, which can be reached Monday thru Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST. (800-333-5535). The return policy is as follows:

n You must be issued a return authorization number.

n You must return **unused** merchandise in the original packaging to us within 30 days of receiving a return authorization number.

n The return authorization number **must** be visibly displayed on the outside of the returning container.

n All returns must be pre-paid shipping and fully insured, as we will not accept collect shipments.

n Return claims must be made within the 30 days of the invoice ship date.

n Returns must be accompanied by a copy of the original invoice/packing slip.

n Please send your package to us via insured and prepaid U.S. mail or ground UPS (for your protection and to ensure prompt delivery). Original shipping fees are not refundable.  
Merchandise shipped in error will be exchanged or refunded, at no charge. We cannot be responsible for unauthorized returns. Restocking fees are only imposed when absolutely necessary. These charges range from 10% to 20% based on circumstances as follows:

a) Original packaging has been damaged and therefore the product must be inspected and repackaged. This procedure is intended to insure our customers always receive fresh merchandise.

b) The product has been damaged and cannot be resold as new. If damage is significant, the product will be returned to the original customer.

**Backorders**  
Sometimes it becomes necessary to cancel orders for a backorder or discontinued part. Therefore, we reserve the right to cancel these orders. Backorders, if any, will not be billed until they become available and are shipped. There is no additional shipping charge on backorder shipments.
