# Welcome to 407 ETR

**We respect the privacy and protect the confidentiality of your personal information.**

The 407 ETR Privacy Policy has been established in accordance with federal privacy legislation (PIPEDA) to inform you about our practices and procedures concerning the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

**IMPORTANT POLICY HIGHLIGHTS  
 _Keeping You Aware and Informed about Your Personal Information._**

Thank you for taking the time to read this important policy on how we protect your personal information. 

Just as 407 ETR is unique from any other highway in Canada, we are also different from many businesses you choose to deal with like your financial institution, insurance company, public utility or a credit card company. That’s because with those companies, you need to call or sign-up with them and provide your pertinent personal information before you are provided any product or service.

As a state-of-the-art, open access electronic toll highway legislated to provide service under the Highway 407 Act, when you choose to travel 407 ETR, you consent to the retrieval of your personal information as the registered owner of the vehicle plate, by use of the highway. This information is supplied to us from the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) to bill you for choosing to use highway 407 and collect payment. In fact, we are required – by law – to use your personal information for this purpose. 

407 ETR cannot and does not sell your personal information to any other company or organization to promote their products or services. We only disclose your personal information, should it be necessary, to limited third parties (such as a collection agency) who must also abide with this agreement, so as to administer or collect payments on behalf of 407 ETR.

It’s important to note that account set up at 407 ETR revolves around a vehicle plate entering and exiting the highway. Once a trip has been recorded with your vehicle plate, we then collect your personal information from the Ministry of Transportation and establish an account for you. A 407 ETR bill account is always set up in the name and address of the vehicle plate owner, regardless of who drives the vehicle at the time of the recorded trip(s).

Similarly, if you wish to have someone other than yourself (vehicle plate owner) to have access to all information on your account (such as a spouse or relative that manages your bills), please contact us to have this person(s) added to your account record as an alternate account holder.

You can have your personal information deleted from our records – if evidence demonstrates that a vehicle plate registered in your name has not travelled 407 ETR – by contacting us in writing and include your name, address and 407 ETR account number.

**6\. Accuracy**

We encourage you to review and confirm the accuracy of all personal information provided to us. If you find errors or if changes are required to this information, we urge you to immediately contact 407 ETR, as listed at the end of this Policy guide. We will make the appropriate changes and update your records accordingly. 

In addition, and by law, you must provide the Ministry of Transportation with a change of address notice within 6 days of moving. Automatic updates are not provided to 407 ETR from the Ministry of Transportation. To ensure prompt billing, we also require you to forward this important information to us.

**9\. Individual Access**

407 ETR will give customers access to the Personal Information it retains within a reasonable time, upon written request with satisfactory identification. You also have the right to know of the existence, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. We may charge a nominal fee for responding to any request, and if so, we will give you notice in advance of the costs associated for processing your request.

If we deny a request for access to your Personal Information, we will advise you in writing of the reason(s) for the refusal and you may then challenge our decision. Some examples of the reasons why we may not be able to provide you with access to your Personal Information include:

  * where providing access would likely reveal Personal Information about a third party
  * where the information cannot be disclosed for legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, or
  * where the information is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege



If you have any questions, concerns, or problems regarding how 407 ETR protects the privacy of your Personal Information, please contact us. Our Customer Service Representatives will be pleased to explain your options. 

If you have any questions about this Policy, or how a request for information was handled, please contact the 407 ETR Privacy Office at: Customer Advocacy & Privacy Office 6300 Steeles Avenue West, Woodbridge Ontario, Canada L4H 1J1 

Any changes to the 407 ETR Privacy Policy and information handling practices and procedures shall be acknowledged in the Privacy Policy in a timely manner. 

407 ETR may add, modify or remove portions of this policy when it is appropriate to do so.
