**Background**  


When you register with this site or one of its affiliated web sites, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to process your requests and to communicate with you about the status of your requests. We also use your email address to send you newsletters you are subscribed to during registration, as well as messages about any special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. Occasionally, we send our customers special offers and promotional information via postal mail, using the shipping address provided.

This network is built to establish private one-to-one relationships between its members. With prior consent, we also use your contact information as a mechanism to communicate with other members.    
For this reason, there are areas of our site where you will be asked to agree to a meeting, interview or some other forum with one or more members.  When you agree, your contact information will be exchanged with the other parties involved so that you may effectively conduct and business transactions desired.

**Collection and Use of Information**  


We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. When you first register with us, we ask for your email address and a password. At this time, we may subscribe you to various email publications. You can unsubscribe at any time. 

We also offer an Associate program, where associate members direct customers to the network through links on their Web sites. We ask associates for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to determine whether a site will be included in our network. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes.

**Security and Access**

For transmitting your personal information to us, we use a secure server (SSL), which encrypts all of your personal information. This encryption process ensures that the information you give us is protected against unauthorized access. All personal information is password-protected so no one can access the information but you. 

We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

Users should not post personal information to any site if they are uncomfortable with the security of the site.  If you have any questions, please contact us.  Back to top

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
