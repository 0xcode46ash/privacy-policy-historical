## Cookies

Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Our site makes use of cookies for purposes of user targeting and research and development. We collect information regarding browsing patterns and usage of our site only.

We also record data regarding the search terms and categories our visitors access and the length of time each visitor spends on a page. This is aggregate data and not individual data. We use this data exclusively for internal purposes, as a means of continually evaluating what visitors are looking for and how well we are providing it. Once statistics are compiled, this data is discarded permanently.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The information we collect helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this web-site analysis tool by clicking here.
