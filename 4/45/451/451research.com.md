Date Last Updated: August 5, 2014

**Information Collection and Use**

451 Research is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. This page describes 451 Research’s privacy policy. When you register on 451 Research’s Web sites, or for 451 Research events, or you purchase products, we ask you to provide personal information. We use this information to enable us to provide you with the best guidance and highest-quality services. 

**Children**

451 Research does not market to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. You can find out more about online privacy for children from the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy. 

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information is any piece of data about a person that can, in any way, identify them or allow someone to contact them. This may include, but is not limited to, names, mailing or email address, and phone numbers. 451 Research receives and stores any information you provide the 451 Research Web site. 

451 Research shall never share or sell personally identifiable information with any advertisers, outside agencies, clients or third parties. No one outside of 451 Research and its Affiliates will be given any information that could identify you or allow someone to contact you.

 **Personally Linked Information**

Personally linked information is data that does not identify a specific person, but is still linked to a specific person. This includes Web site logins, customer support requests and Web site viewing habits in general.

This information is used to help us improve our product and service offerings, as well as to provide more personalized content to our clients. 

Personally linked information is never shared with any advertisers, outside agencies, clients or third parties. No one outside of 451 Research and its Affiliates will ever see or in any way obtain specific data about a particular person’s viewing habits on our Web site. 

**Aggregated Information**

Like most Web sites, we automatically gather and store certain personal information and aggregated, non-personally identifiable information in order to provide you with a better experience when using the 451 Research Web sites. Aggregated information is information that has been collected, compiled and summed in the aggregate, and bears no connection to any specific person. 

This information might include total views of a particular report or a total number of logins in a 24-hour period. Aggregated information is always anonymous by its very nature. Aggregated information is used for any number of purposes, including future research direction, press releases and customer relations. There are no limitations on the use of aggregated information as exist with personally identifiable and personally linked information. Aggregated information does not identify individual users, and we do not link aggregated information to your personal information.

Also, when you register for an event, we may request additional information about your hotel, meal and other travel preferences. This information is used only for the specific event. 451 Research uses third-party service providers such as credit card processing companies, shipping companies, mailing houses and event coordinators, together with other service providers as required to satisfy client requests. 

**Cookies**
