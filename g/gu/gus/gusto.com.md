##### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy provides information regarding the privacy practices and policies of Gusto Insurance. These practices and policies have been adopted to ensure that the information that we obtain and maintain for our clients and customers, which may also include information about the employees, dependents, former employees and dependents, and other eligible participants on a group health plan for which we are providing services (“Protected Parties”), is protected in accordance with relevant state and federal rules. The Privacy Policy outlines our practices, policies, and legal duties to maintain and protect against prohibited disclosure of personally-identifiable financial information (as required by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act (“GLB Act”), and the various state laws implementing those requirements), Protected Health Information of those Protected Parties (under the privacy regulations mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and further expanded by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act provisions in Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“HITECH”) and the regulations related to these laws and mandates), and the protection of personally- identifiable information under 45 CFR § 155.260 (collectively referred herein as “Privacy Rules”).

THIS POLICY DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT A PROTECTED PARTY MAY BE COLLECTED, USED AND DISCLOSED. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. THE PROTECTION OF THE PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION GUSTO INSURANCE MAINTAINS IS IMPORTANT TO US.

  1. ##### Statement of Gusto Insurance’s Duties.

Gusto Insurance is required by law to maintain the privacy of non-public personal information (“NPPI”), protected health information (“PHI”), and personally-identifiable information (“PII”) (collectively referred herein as “Protected Information”) of the Protected Parties and to provide Gusto Insurance’s clients with this Privacy Policy. Gusto Insurance reserves the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy and to adopt any new provisions regarding the Protected Information that it maintains about the Protected Parties. Any information that is collected via our Service is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. If Gusto Insurance revises this Privacy Policy, it will notify you of those changes by posting them on the Service or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.

  2. ##### Statement of the Client’s Rights under Privacy Rules.

As a Gusto Insurance client or customer, you have a right to know how Gusto Insurance may use or disclose the Protected Information it maintains on those Protected Parties with whom there is a direct relationship. A direct relationship shall be one in which the Protected Party has interacted directly with the Site. In the event that a Gusto Insurance customer or client is an employer sponsoring a group health plan, **Gusto Insurance does not have a direct duty to their employees, dependents, former employees or dependents or other eligible participants on the group health plan unless those individuals personally utilize the Site, thereby establishing a direct relationship.** Gusto Insurance’s obligations to not disclose the Protected Information it maintains about those individuals may arise due to our contractual obligations as a Business Associate of both the client or customer, as well as to any other third party who is a Covered Entity under the Privacy Rules, but does not create a special legal duty to provide notice to those individuals of their rights through a Notice of Privacy Practices. 

**Primary Uses and Disclosures of Protected Information.** Gusto Insurance uses and discloses Protected Information about Protected Parties to carry out payment, health care, and other benefits related operations in connection with providing the Service. Privacy Rules do not generally “preempt” (or take precedence over) state privacy or other applicable laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, to the extent state law applies, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than the Privacy Rules, might impose a privacy standard under which Gusto Insurance will be required to operate. For example, where such laws have been enacted, Gusto Insurance will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and disclosures of the Protected Information concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse / chemical dependency, genetic testing, reproductive rights. 

Gusto Insurance also may use or disclose Protected Information in the following situations:

**For Your Access.** Gusto Insurance might use and transfer your Protected Information to Gusto’s website in order for you to gain access to information regarding your enrollment and billing information related to your selected benefit(s) plans (such as your selected group health plan) via the Gusto website. Gusto Insurance might also use and transfer aggregated, summary benefit(s) plan data to clients and customers – this summary data will not include any individually-identifiable information. 

**Payment:** Gusto Insurance might use and disclose your Protected Information for all activities that are included within the definition of “payment” within the Privacy Rules. For example, Gusto Insurance might use and disclose a Protected Party’s Protected Information to assist with the payment of services by doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and others for services that are covered by a group health plan. Gusto Insurance might also use your information to determine your eligibility for benefits, to coordinate benefits, to examine medical necessity, to obtain premiums, and to issue explanations of benefits to the person who subscribes to the health plan in which you participate. 

**Health Care Operations:** Gusto Insurance might use and disclose a Protected Party’s Protected Information for all activities that are included within the definition of “health care operations” within the Privacy Rules. For example, Gusto Insurance might use and disclose the Protected Information of a Protected Party to an insurer to determine the premiums for your health plan, to conduct quality assessment and improvement activities, to engage in care coordination or case management, and to manage its business. 

**Business Associate Subcontractors:** In connection with its payment, health care, and other benefits related operations activities, Gusto Insurance contracts with individuals and entities (called “subcontractors”) to perform various functions on its behalf or to provide certain types of services. To perform these functions or to provide the services, Gusto Insurance’s subcontractors will receive, have access to, create, maintain, use, or disclose Protected Information, but only after Gusto Insurance requires the subcontractor to agree in writing to contract terms designed to appropriately safeguard your information. 

**Other Covered Entities:** In addition, Gusto Insurance might use or disclose your Protected Information to assist health care and other benefits providers in connection with their treatment or payment activities, or to assist other covered entities in connection with certain of their health care and other benefits related operations. For example, Gusto Insurance might disclose a Protected Party’s Protected Information to a health care provider when needed by the provider to render treatment to that party, and Gusto Insurance might disclose Protected Information to another covered entity or subcontractor to conduct health care operations related to billing, claims payment or enrollment. For all other uses and disclosures, Gusto Insurance first must obtain your permission.
