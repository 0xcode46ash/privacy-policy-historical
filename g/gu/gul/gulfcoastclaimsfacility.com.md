                                        WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
I.   Scope
     This Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices
     regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please
     be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting information to this site.
II.  Consent
     By using this site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information
     via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance
     with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to submit your information to us using this site, please
     download a claim form from this site and submit the form to the address written at the end of this
     Privacy Policy.
III. Information We Collect
     You may be required to provide personal information to access the site. To use some of the
     features offered on the site and to allow us to evaluate and process your claim, you may need to
     provide us information such as:
           your contact information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number)
           your social security number or tax identification number
           your financial information
           medical information
IV.  How We Use and Share Your Information
     We use and disclose the information that you submit to us, including personal information, to:
           process a claim for compensation and any award resulting from that claim and to
              communicate with you about the claim
           support the legitimate business purposes of the GCCF
           determine collateral source payments
           respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders,
              or government regulations. We shall also disclose information to appropriate law
              enforcement authorities if we believe, in good faith, that the information submitted to us
              evidences fraud or that the site is being misused in a manner that may infringe upon the
              rights or property of GCCF, other visitors to the site, or anyone else.
           make periodic reports to interested parties, including BP Exploration & Production, Inc.
              (BP), regarding claims made and claims determinations
     We may provide reports that include non-personal information to state, local, and federal
     government officials and to BP to permit evaluation of the claims process.
     If service providers are required to assist us with any of the foregoing activities, we require them
     to keep the information secure. We also prohibit them from using your information for any
     purpose other than that requested by us.


      We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
V.    Access to Correct or Update Information
      To keep personal information that you provide on this site accurate, current, and complete, if
      necessary, please access the site and provide updated or corrected information and we will take
      appropriate steps to update or correct such information in our possession. Additionally, you can
      submit this information to the address written at the end of this Privacy Policy.
VI.   About Children
      This site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personal
      information on this site from visitors in this age group. If you are under the age of 13, please do
      not use this site or provide information to us. If we become aware that we have received
      personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable
      efforts to delete that information from our database.
VII.  Statistical Information
      We may gather non-personal, statistical information about the use of the site, such as how many
      visitors visit a specific page, how long they remain on that page, and the hyperlinks, if any, on
      which they “click.” Through the use of technological features such as “internet protocol (IP)
      addresses” (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you use the
      internet) and “cookies” (pieces of information that a site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for
      record-keeping purposes), we may collect that kind of information to enable the site to work
      correctly, to evaluate use of the site, and to support site analytics. We may also compile that data
      to describe the use of the site to interested parties, or to respond to a government and/or legal
      request. This compiled information will not personally identify you or any other visitor to the site.
VIII. IP Addresses
      Web servers, computers that “serve up” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP
      address. We record IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report statistical
      information to interested parties and to track the use of the site. When a visitor requests pages
      from the site, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to
      any personal information. Although your session is logged, you typically remain anonymous to us.
      We reserve the right to identify you through an IP address, however, if we believe it necessary to
      enforce compliance with the site’s information practices or to protect GCCF, other visitors to the
      site, or anyone else.
IX.   Security
      Protecting the security of your personal information is very important to us. We use reasonable
      security measures designed to protect the confidentiality of personal information. When you
      transmit personal information from your computer to our servers, your information is protected
      by a “firewall” (a combination of hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors
      from accessing information within our computer network), as well as industry standard SSL
      (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable
      precautions to keep your information secure on our systems. While we strive to protect your
      privacy, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We,
      therefore, cannot warrant or guarantee the security of any personal information you transmit to
      us online, or any documents you upload online, or be responsible for the theft, destruction, or
      inadvertent disclosure of that information.


X.   Links to Other Sites
     Please be aware that, when you are on the site, you could be directed to other sites that are
     beyond our control. Links may take you from the pages of this site to unaffiliated sites. These
     other sites may transmit their own “cookies” to visitors, collect data or solicit personal
     information. The privacy policies of these other sites may differ significantly from this Privacy
     Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee
     the security of any information that may be collected there.
XI.  Changes to This Policy
     The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If a change is made, the “Last
     Modified” date located at the top of this Policy will be updated to reflect the amendment. You are
     advised to check periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the site after we post
     changes to this Privacy Policy will indicate your acceptance of those changes.
