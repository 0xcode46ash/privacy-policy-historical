This policy applies only to site(s) maintained by GwG. We may create links to the Web Sites of our promotional partners and companies for games that are supported through our competitions. Although we will make every effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy, this policy does not apply to third party sites.

We cannot control these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Furthermore, we do not support links to third party sites in our forums, and we are not responsible for any content appearing on those sites.

However, visitors who do not wish to, or are not allowed by law to share personally identifying information, may not be able to access certain areas or create a user account, which requires registration.
