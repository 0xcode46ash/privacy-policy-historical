Privacy Policy Guideline is committed to respecting the privacy of the information obtained through your visit to our websites, and we will only use such information to help create a better experience for you. This policy explains the uses we currently make of this information.

Anytime you visit our websites, we generally collect the following information: date and time of visit, pages visited, name of the domain from which you accessed the internet, and any materials you download from our site. We also use “cookies” to improve our site and make it easier to use. If you use certain advanced features of our websites, such as registering a personal account, purchasing products, joining email lists, etc., we may also collect information such as: your name, company name, home or business address, email address, age, gender, occupation, interests, credit card information and geographic location. Without your express online permission, your information will only be used by us and our qualified subcontractors to provide you with the services you have requested, to better understand your user preferences so that we may customize your user experience and offer to you products and services which we believe would be of interest to you, and to determine user preferences and trends on an aggregate, no-names basis to help improve our internal business operations. At any time, you may “opt-out” of any marketing or other email distribution lists. Without your express online permission, Guideline will not share your personally identifiable information with any other third party except as required by law (for example, a valid subpoena, lawsuit or law enforcement demand). 

By using this website, you agree to this Privacy Policy, including any international users, who agree to be bound by U.S. law. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy, and it supersedes any earlier version. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time without advance notice.
