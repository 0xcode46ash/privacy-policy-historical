# Privacy Policy

We respect every individual's right to privacy. We do not rent, sell or trade names of visitors to our Web site. We do not sell any personal information to anyone.

In addition, GuideStone Financial Resources has implemented security features for your protection. The transmission of your account information cannot be intercepted between the GuideStone server and your email account.

However, once you receive an email, your account information is only as secure and held private as determined by you and your email provider. When GuideStone Financial Resources sends your account information to your email address, please take the necessary steps to secure your privacy when this information is delivered to you.

Be sure that you provide GuideStone with the email address that is most likely to be read only by you. If you share an email address with others at home or your office, consider setting up an email address with one of the free services provided by Internet companies (Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.). 

If others have access to your email/computer at your office, use one of these security ideas:

  * Make sure all access to your email is password-protected and that you change your password regularly. 
  * Save your email in a file that is only accessible by you (that has password protection). 
  * Cut and paste the information into a document that is password-protected by you. 
  * Print your account information and save a hard copy in a secure file, then immediately delete the email from your computer's hard drive.
