**1\. What personal information do we gather?**  In general, you may visit Guidewire Software's Web site without providing us with any personal information about yourself. However, there are times when we may need information from you, which includes your Internet address so that we can track unique visits to our site for analytic purposes. Additionally, we may need your personal information such as your name, and your postal and email address in order to grant you access to protected and secured sites or provide you with the opportunity to register for an event, to fulfill your requests for information including white papers, download updates to our products, or participate in an online survey. In other instances, we may ask you to provide us with information such as your product interests so that we can send you only the information that is useful to you, including articles, newsletters, product and service alerts, new product and service announcements and event invitations.

If you wish to apply for a job within the careers section of the site, we will collect personal information about you such as name, email address, and phone number. We will also ask you to provide us with a cover letter and a resume. We use this information to contact you regarding the position in which you expressed interest, to determine whether or not you are qualified for the position and to contact you regarding setting up an interview.

**2\. How do we collect your personal information?**  We collect information directly through response forms that you choose to complete. We may also collect information indirectly through the use of cookies. The cookies we use identify you only as a number. "Persistent" cookies are stored on your computer and used in subsequent visits to our sites. "Session" cookies only exist for a specific visit. You can disable your computer from accepting one or both cookie types by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu in your browser. If you disable both types, most of the .com site will function, but you will not be able to log in to certain portions of our support site (Downloads or Knowledge Base pages). If you disable "persistent" cookies, but not "session" cookies, these pages should still function. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site.

**3\. How do we use your personal information?**  Information we collect is used to determine what is most effective about our web site, to help us identify ways to improve sites, to personalize the visit for you through the use of "persistent cookies" if you permit it, and to determine how we can tailor our web site to make it more effective. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information (for example, if you are invited to register for an event or request more information about one of our products). When you supply Guidewire Software with your personal information, we may use the information to learn more about you so that we can develop better products and services or use the information, sharing it with our business partners, to inform you about new products, services and offers that may be of interest to you.

Information we collect from the careers section of the site will be used to help us determine how suitable you are for employment by Guidewire. We might also use it for statistical analysis – for diversity monitoring, or to assess the success of our advertising campaigns, for example. And any information you submit as part of your application may be verified. This could mean we check your qualifications, or that we'll contact your references. We won't contact your current employer, without your permission. We will seek your consent before using your information for any purpose not listed in this Privacy Policy.

We post customer testimonials/videos on our Web site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial or video to post their name along with it. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials or videos, contact us at info [at] guidewire.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**4\. Do we share your information with outside parties?**  We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Occasionally, we share information with our business partners to inform you about new products and services that are complementary to your existing Guidewire Software solution. Any information you give to Guidewire Software will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. We may provide your personal information to service providers who furnish a way for users to submit job applications, sign up for events, and send emails on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Guidewire has contracted with a trusted third party provider to manage its online employment application process. Guidewire's third party provider has agreed to comply with all regulations designed to protect your privacy. It will only use candidate information to process Guidewire employment applications and not for its own purposes. It will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party. During the recruitment process, candidate information will be accessed internally only by those Guidewire employees who are directly involved in the recruitment process.

In certain situations, Guidewire may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Web site that collects personal information.

This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Web site.

**5\. What about security?**  The security of your personal information is important to Guidewire Software and we take appropriate steps to maintain security of your personal information. The open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. While this is out of our control, we aim to apply appropriate levels of security at all times. We use industry standard technologies and maintain current security standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration, or misuse.

We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered to. We routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the confidentiality and privacy of your information is not compromised.

To safeguard against unauthorized access to your accounts, you are required to "sign on" using a user ID and a password to certain secured areas of the [www.guidewire.com web](http://www.guidewire.com%20web/) site. Both user ID and password are encrypted when sent over the Internet. If you are unable to provide the correct password, you will not be able to access these sections. Despite all of our efforts, the Internet is inherently unsecure and we cannot guarantee that information provided online will be secure at all times. Suffice it to say that the security of your personal information is important to us and we will use all reasonable means to keep it as safe as possible.

**6\. Do we give you access to your information?** Upon request Guidewire will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. To request this information please contact us at info [at] guidewire.com.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

By entering your personal information in the Guidewire Careers website you accept that we may retain your information and it may be held by Guidewire or by any third party company that processes it on our behalf. We'll store all the information you submit as part of your application. And, in the course of the recruitment process, we might record further information about you. We collect and process sensitive personal data only so far as is necessary to ensure we comply with legal requirements, for example under the equality of opportunity laws. We will retain your information for a minimum of 6 months from your last update, unless otherwise required by law. If you are hired by Guidewire, the personal information you have submitted will be retained as part of your employment record.
