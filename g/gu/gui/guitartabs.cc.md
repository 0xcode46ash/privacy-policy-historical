 _Guitar Tab Universe_ is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online. 

**Basic Confidentiality Policy:**   
     It is the _Guitar Tab Universe_ policy that personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to post on the discussion boards or utilize other member services). For example, when you make a post on the message board, your username will be revealed to anyone who reads your message but more sensitive information such as your name or e-mail address is only included if you so wish. You are free to delete this information from the message headers prior to its submission but please leave it accurate and up to date in your account profile. If you also indicate that you would like to receive information about _GTU_ and its activities in the form of e-mail messages and newsletters, your personal information will be added to the appropriate _GTU_ mailing lists. If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from the any mailing lists, or correct your personal information, please log in and edit your profile. 

**Release of Information to Third Parties:**   
      _Guitar Tab Universe_ and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. During the process of delivering an ad to you, _Guitar Tab Universe_ does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, _GTU_ does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by _GTU_ is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. 

In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of Guitar Tab Universe, one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from members. Regardless, the use of this information by any successor to Guitar Tab Universe would still be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy (as it is amended from time to time).
