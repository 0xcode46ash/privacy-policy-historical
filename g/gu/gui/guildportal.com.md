We use this information to contact the user about services on our site in which we believe he or she may have interest. Additionally, the e-mail address of each user is used by the system in an automated fashion, for mailing out notification of "events" and other relevant items concerning the "Guilds" that the user is a member of.

GuildPortal uses information solely to support the functions of the service it provides. 

Profile

A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information (e-mail address + password combination) to perform the functions of the community hosting service. We do not share the user's profile with other third parties. 

Cookies

For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser or choose to "log out," the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored ont he user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Session ID cookies are used by GuildPortal.com to track user preferences while the user is visiting the site, to minimize load times and save on server processing.

Information about user's visit to this site, such as the number of times they have viewed an ad (but not personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.GuildPortal.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Log Files Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Special Offers and Updates

Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a possible newsletter.

However, removing the ability for these types of communications also removes the ability for the user to receive e-mail concerning events that their Guild(s) are participating in. 

Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email.
