## National Guideline Clearinghouse™ (NGC) Privacy Notice and Policy Statement on Cookies

### Information Automatically Collected and Stored

When you visit any Web site, search content, read pages, browse or download information, certain information about your visit can be collected. The National Guideline Clearinghouse™ (NGC™), sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, automatically collects and temporarily stores the following information about your visit, but this information does not identify you personally: 

  * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain).
  * The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site.
  * The date and time of your visit.
  * The pages you visited.
  * The address of the Web site you came from, if you were referred from another site.



NGC uses this information to compile usage statistics for our site, to find out about general user interest in various areas of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. 

NGC tracks the keywords that are entered into our search engine and the browse terms used to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not monitor which terms a particular user enters. 

### Cookie Disclaimer

A "cookie" is information stored on your computer by a Web server and used to customize your Web service in some way. NGC uses "cookies" to store information about your interactions that may be needed later to perform a function. Currently, the NGC Web site uses "session cookies" to remember whether a user has viewed the NGC Disclaimer statement and to store information in the users' Guideline Collection for the duration of the session. NGC does not use "persistent cookies" and does not use "cookie" information for any other purpose, nor does it make the information available to anyone else. 

You can choose not to accept cookies and still use the NGC Web site. However, you will be unable to use the cookie-dependent features. Refer to the help information in your browser software for instructions on how to disable cookies. 

No additional information is collected about your visit, and we do not record information about individual behavior or use of the site. 

### Personally Provided Information

You do not have to give us personal information to visit the NGC Web site. If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. The information provided is handled on a confidential basis. However, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your message is sensitive, you may prefer to send it by postal mail instead. 

### Disclosure

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, NGC makes no attempt to identify individual users or usage patterns. We do not give, share, sell or transfer any personal information to a third party. 

### Intrusion Detection

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

### Systems of Records

Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and regulations and guidance from the National Archives and Records Administration, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.
