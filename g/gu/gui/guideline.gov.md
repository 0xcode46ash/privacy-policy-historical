National Guideline Clearinghouse ™ (NGC™) automatically collects and temporarily stores the following information about your visit, but this information does not identify you personally: 

  * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain).
  * The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site.
  * The date and time of your visit.
  * The pages you visited.
  * The address of the Web site you came from, if you were referred from another site.

NGC tracks the keywords that are entered into our search engine and the browse terms used to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not monitor which terms a particular user enters.
