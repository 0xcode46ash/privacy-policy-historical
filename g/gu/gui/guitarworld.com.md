Future Network USA believes that you should control the dissemination of the personally identifiable information that you provide when using the www.guitarworld.com web site ("the Site"). Please review this policy carefully to understand how we will treat the personally identifiable information that you give to us.

Your use of this Site in any fashion constitutes your agreement to the terms of Future Network USA's Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (http://www.guitarworld.com/0100/framesets/leagal.html). Please review this page periodically. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to any such changes.  


**_What personally identifiable information is collected on this Site_?**

You do not have to provide any personally identifiable information to use the Site. However, when you use the Site to subscribe to our publications, to enter contests, or to post messages on the Site, Future Network USA collects personally identifiable information as indicated in each such area of the Site, including your name, address, email address, zip code, phone number, and gender. Future Network USA may also collect data related to the areas of Future Network USA that you visit and how often you visit those areas.

Future Network USA will make an effort to include a link to the Privacy Policy whenever we ask you for additional personally identifiable information.  


_**How is my personally identifiable information used?**_ _  
_

We use the personally identifiable information on our subscription form to ensure proper delivery of your issues of Guitar World and Guitar World Acoustic, and your e-mail or mail-in contact information in connection with our contests, sweepstakes and other promotions in order to ensure the validity of your entries, to notify you if you are a winner, to send information about Guitar World, other Future Network USA publications and other Site features prizes and offers via email (unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications), to send you advertising from selected Future Network USA partners and advertisers (unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications) and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws.

We may also aggregate the information we collect to develop certain summary reports for our partners and/or advertisers. We provide this information to assist our partners and/or advertisers in determining how to promote their products and services. In so doing, we do not reveal personally identifiable information or disclose specifically who saw or clicked on their advertisements or other links.

**_Who has access to my personally identifiable information?_**

  
Only Future Network USA has ongoing access to your personally identifiable information.

  
Future Network USA works hard to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. While we takes steps to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from the Site, and you use the Site at your own risk.

Future Network USA may share the following personally identifiable information with its advertisers, sponsors, and partners in the following circumstances:

  * Information you provide when you register to receive goods or services from Future Network USA or from one of our advertisers/partners/sponsors. 
  * Data related to the areas of the Site that you visit and how often you visit those areas. 



Future Network USA does not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party except in special situations described above, and as to comply with the law or administer the Site. Other than as described above, Future Network USA will only share with third party partners, sponsors, and advertisers the information you have provided to us in aggregate form — that is, as a summary report showing, for instance, how many residents of a specific state subscribed to our publication or participated in a contest.

**Responses to Particular Offers.** Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers or emails from selected third parties, we may provide a report to an advertiser or partner which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email which offers you a discount on a particular product. If you click on that e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the personally identifiable information necessary to provide you with that discount.

**Administering the Site and Compliance with Law:** Future Network USA may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Future Network USA may also disclose information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use, or to protect the safety of our users or the public. In addition, Future Network USA may disclose or access personally identifiable information for administrative and other purposes that we believe are necessary to develop, maintain and improve our products and services.
