## How is my personally identifiable information used?

We use the personally identifiable information on our subscription form to ensure proper delivery of your issues of Guitar World and Guitar World Acoustic, and your e-mail or mail-in contact information in connection with our contests, sweepstakes and other promotions in order to ensure the validity of your entries, to notify you if you are a winner, to send information about Guitar World, other Future US, Inc. publications and other Site features prizes and offers via email (unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications), to send you advertising from selected Future US, Inc. partners and advertisers (unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications) and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws.

We may also aggregate the information we collect to develop certain summary reports for our partners and/or advertisers. We provide this information to assist our partners and/or advertisers in determining how to promote their products and services. In so doing, we do not reveal personally identifiable information or disclose specifically who saw or clicked on their advertisements or other links.

## Who has access to my personally identifiable information?

Only Future US, Inc. has ongoing access to your personally identifiable information.

Future US, Inc. works hard to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.
