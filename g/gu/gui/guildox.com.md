Privacy Statement for [GuildOx](http://www.guildox.com/)

GuildOx takes safeguarding online privacy seriously. Please read the following to understand GuildOx's privacy practices.

From time to time, GuildOx may need to change its privacy statement because of changes in its business, or in its attempts to serve your needs better. GuildOx will use reasonable efforts to publish any changes to its privacy statement. 

What information does GuildOx gather?

There are times when GuildOx may need to gather specific information from you such as your name and email address, among other personal information. Information that is essential for GuildOx to provide the services and/or products that are requested by you is generally designated as "Required". Additional information that would allow GuildOx flexibility in providing its services or products, and may be used for internal statistical studies or market research, is generally indicated as "Optional". For example, a credit card number is required when ordering a product, whereas a fax number may not be essential, but would provide another means of communication between you and GuildOx. The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to GuildOx is completely at your discretion. It is never mandatory for you to answer any question, although it may limit the services and products that GuildOx is able to offer. 

How does GuildOx use personal information?

When you submit personal information to GuildOx, you understand that you are agreeing to allow GuildOx, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, access to, storage of, and use of, the data in any of the countries where GuildOx, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, do business. GuildOx may use the personal information you submit for any purposes related to GuildOx's business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending you surveys, and notifying you of product upgrades and updates, new products, special offers, seminars and conventions and any other changes within GuildOx that may affect you. 

What choices do you have about how your personal information is used and what is GuildOx's commitment to data quality and reliability?

GuildOx respects your privacy and realizes that not everyone likes to receive special offers or information. If you would like your name deactivated from GuildOx's lists, or if you would like to unsubscribe from GuildOx's e-mail bulletins, please use the contact information below to request that GuildOx deactivate you from its lists. Be sure to include your name, postal address, telephone number, information contained in your GuildOx mailer, and/or other necessary information requested for deactivation. If you believe that GuildOx may not have your correct and current personal information, you may update your information any time by using the contact information below to inform GuildOx of changes in your personal information. GuildOx will use reasonable efforts to honor your requests, but we appreciate your patience in allowing us a reasonable amount of time for processing. 

Does GuildOx share the information that it gathers with third parties?

GuildOx does not share personal data with third parties. 

Does GuildOx share the information that it gathers with government agencies or law enforcement?

GuildOx reserves the right to monitor, and disclose to, government officials or law enforcement, without your consent, any communications and personally identifiable information, whenever prompted to do so, by legal authorities, even when you have requested that your information not be disclosed to third parties. 

What is GuildOx's commitment to data security?

GuildOx recognizes your concern for security, and will use reasonable efforts to establish secure connections with you and to limit access to databases containing personal information to authorized personnel only. 

Does GuildOx use cookies?
