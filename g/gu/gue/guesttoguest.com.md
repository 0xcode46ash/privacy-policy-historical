Your privacy is very important to GuestToGuest. This page describes how we protect your information and your privacy: 

##  Goals 

The purpose of our limited collection of your personal information is to enable us to: 

  * Offer you the best, most relevant services. 
  * Settle disputes, determine fees, and troubleshoot issues. 
  * Detect the forbidden or illegal activities on our website or enforce the terms of use. 
  * Inform you of our services and those of our partners and cross-check information to validate its authenticity. 



##  Information collection 

When you become a member of GuestToGuest, you accept that we collect and save the following personal information: 

  * Your name, email address, postal address and various information about the homes you post on our website (address, description, size, pictures, etc.). 
  * Information pertaining to the transaction and activities on our website (such as your invitations, your messages, your friends, your transactions in GuestPoints and in Euros).

##  Transmission to third parties 

We do not sell, rent or give away your personal information for marketing purposes without your formal consent. If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us or from our partners, you simply have to indicate it in your profile.  
The only way your information would be shared is to meet our legal requirements, enforce our rules, defend our rights, and the property or the safety of anyone.  
We can also communicate your data to partner companies, provided that you have explicitly agreed to it beforehand.

We use cookies on some of our pages to analyze the traffic on these pages; to personalize our services, content and ads. We also use cookies to measure the efficiency of our promotional campaigns and to promote trust and security. You can easily clear these cookies by clearing the browsing history of your navigator, although doing so will be detrimental to your experience using our website. 

##  Email address usage 

You cannot use our tools to send to other members unsolicited messages or any other content that would violate our terms of use. If you send an email to someone who is not a GuestToGuest member (by using the "invite a friend" tool for instance), we will not permanently store this email, and we will not use it for our marketing purposes. We will not sell or rent this email in any way. 

##  Your responsibility 

Do not share your GuestToGuest password to anyone. If you do share it with others, please keep in mind that you are responsible for any actions that they will commit from your account.
