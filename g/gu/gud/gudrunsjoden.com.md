# Cookies, security, and your personal information – Gudrun Sjödén

## **Cookies and personal data**

At Gudrun Sjödén Design AB, we work hard to make sure you feel safe when using our website, www.gudrunsjoden.com. We have therefore developed a policy outlining issues related to security and privacy on the website. This document addresses the following issues:

  * Personal data
  * Encryption
  * Cookies
  * Links
  * Colors
  * Copyright



**Personal data** – We take responsibility for all personal data, such as name, address and personal identity number, that you submit to us or which we receive when you register for purchases or upon recruitment. Gudrun Sjödén Design AB is responsible for personal data pursuant to the Swedish Personal Data Act (PUL). Gudrun Sjödén Design AB will not give out your personal data to third parties. This means your information will not be used outside of our company’s operations.

**Why do we gather information and what information does this involve?**  \- When you order from www.gudrunsjoden.com you simultaneously consent to us storing and using your information, the same way we would had you made the purchase by mail order. We will use this information to fulfill commitments to you and to provide the service you expect. This may mean delivering the goods you ordered, conducting a credit check, sending you information about the Gudrun Sjödén Club and other offers for marketing purposes. If any problems occur related to delivering your order, we will use the information to contact you.

**Where can you find out what information is registered?**  \- You have the right to contact us to find out what personal data is registered about you. If it is erroneous, incomplete or irrelevant, you may request to correct or remove the data.

You can turn off the use of cookies if you like. In your web browser settings, you can indicate that cookies are not permitted. However, this will mean that you cannot make use of the full functionality of the website. The functionality of our webshop is based on the use of cookies. It will thus not be possible to shop online with us if you turn off the use of cookies in your web browser.

**Cookies for a functioning webshop** \- We use both temporary and permanent cookies in order to provide you with the best possible experience in our webshop. These cookies make it possible, for example, to save products in your shopping cart, to be logged off the site after a certain period of inactivity, and to receive relevant information.

**Cookies for analysis** \- We use cookies to analyze and improve your experience on our website, for example through third-party cookies from Google Analytics. Cookies used for analysis are both temporary cookies that save information about your session and permanent cookies that remember whether you return to our site at a later date.

**Other cookies** – We use third-party cookies to make it possible for you to easily share our content on social media. We also use permanent third-party cookies in order to provide you with relevant offers from us when you visit other websites/social networks.

**Technical requirements** - This website is designed to function smoothly for as many visitors as possible. Most features function in all web browsers. We recommend using the latest version of your web browser for the best experience.

**Links**  \- Here on www.gudrunsjoden.com there may be links to other websites. Gudrun Sjödén Design AB takes no responsibility for the privacy protection or content of these sites.
