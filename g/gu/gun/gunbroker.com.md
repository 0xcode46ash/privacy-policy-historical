Our Privacy Policy  
  
GunBroker.com believes you have a right to your privacy. GunBroker.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site.  
  
###   
General  
  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Other than to facilitate the completion of an auction transaction as specified below, contact and financial information is never shared with any third party. 

If you place a bid on an item, your contact information including name, address, email, and telephone number may be shared with the seller to facilitate the transaction. If you list an item for sale, your contact information including name, address, email, and telephone number may be shared with the bidder(s) to facilitate the transaction. We do not share your financial information with any third party.

We do not do unsolicited mailings. Any email messages generated by GunBroker.com result directly from the user's actions (such as registration information, confirmation of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item), or as necessary to inform you of changes to the auction site or events related to the auction site, or changes to the auction site rules. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
