I.   _Information We Collect On the Site and How We Use It  
_**

You can visit our Web Site and learn about the services we provide without providing personal information.  You do need to provide personal information, however, to sell, bid on or purchase items, and to participate in our user forums and other interactive portions of the Site.   Certain non-personally identifiable information, such as IP address, is collected automatically from every Site visitor, even if not voluntarily provided, as discussed further below.

We collect and use personal information in the specific ways listed below, and generally to improve our Site and services to you, as well as to meet our legal obligations.  We also use personal information you provide for other purposes consistent with the reason you provide such information to us.  


**1.** _Registration  and Site Activity Information._  Our Site’s registration process requires users to provide us valid and accurate contact information including name, address, phone number, birth date and email address (collectively, “Registration Information”).  For fraud prevention purposes, users electing to provide as their sole email contact an email address from a free email service provider (such as Yahoo!® Mail, Google® Gmail, or Hotmail®) are required to enter credit card information at the time of registration, and the card is verified by authorizing a small amount through the credit card processing networks.  


In certain circumstances your registration information may be verified through so-called “credit header” information. You may be required to answer a multiple-choice questionnaire compiled from information managed by consumer and business information sources. These questions can include elements from your financial history. This is done as an identity verification and fraud prevention measure. This verification service is provided by a third party, and we do not collect or store any personal information from this process. All we receive is an indication of how many questions you answered successfully.

We collect certain information submitted during transactions on the Site based on your activities, including bidding, buying and selling, as well as shipping and billing information, and other information you provide in connection with buying or shipping an item (collectively, “Site Activity Information”).We may also collect certain personal information that you provide through message board discussions, chats, correspondence or dispute resolution.  

Registration Information, Site Activity Information  and other personal information that you provide may be used in the following ways:

  * For fraud protection at the time of registration;  

  * To send you transaction-related notifications about transactions you carry out on the Site;  

  * If and when you bid on an item, to share your name, address, telephone number, email address and bid information with the seller to facilitate the transaction;  

  * If and when you list an item for sale, to share your contact information, including name, address, email address, telephone number and item detailwith bidders to facilitate the transaction;  

  * To perform our billing, administration and collections functions (and to contact you when necessary about these functions);  

  * To report information about your account, including late payments, missed payments or other delinquencies or defaults on your accounts, to credit reporting bureaus;  

  * To better understand your interests and for other marketing-related initiatives;  

  * To communicate with you and carry out actions requested by you (such as subscriptions to newsletters), including promotional messages (some of which may be related to your transactions on the Site); and  

  * When facilitating the investigation of fraud or illegal activity, to share information with law enforcement or other governmental agencies or authorized third parties when requested pursuant to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose you, us or another Site user to legal liability.  




  
Please see “Communications From the Site and Your Choices” below for information on controlling communications from us.  


**  
  
2. ** _Financial  Information_ **.  **If you list items on the Site, we collect financial information including bank account and/or credit card number, expiration date, card security code and billing address.  As noted under “Registration and Site Activity Information” above, we also collect credit card information from those who register using an email address from a free email provider such as Yahoo!™ Mail or Hotmail™ or Google’s Gmail.  Financial information is used to bill you for transactions you carry out on the Site and to collect on fees and debts incurred through the use of the Site.  If your account is past due and collection must be pursued, your contact and financial information may be shared with collection agents and/or credit reporting agencies.  We share financial information with non-affiliated third parties to facilitate the completion of transactions on the Site as specified above, to respond to subpoenas, for other legal compliance purposes, and for billing and collections.  


**  
3\.  ** _Contests and Surveys_.  If you decide to enter contests or surveys featured from time to time on the Site, you may be asked for personal information in addition to your Registration Information. This information is used in order to administer the contest or survey (for example, to contact the winner) or as otherwise disclosed on the Site at the time we collect the information.  


4\.   _Information Requests_.  We may ask you to provide personal information in order to allow us to respond to your requests for information or other requests made over the Site.

**5.  ** _Social Media_.  We may collect your user name and other information you transmit to us over social media platforms such as Facebook® or Twitter® when you interact with GunBroker.com’s specific page or social media account.  We use the information you provide on social media to respond to your requests or questions, to improve our services, and for other purposes as disclosed at the time of the interaction.  


**6.  ** _Emails from  GunBroker.com_.  Most email messages generated by the Site result directly from the user’s actions (such as registration information, confirmation of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item, or the user’s choice to subscribe to certain communications), or as necessary to inform you of changes to the Site or events related to the Site, or changes to the Site rules or policies. Other e-mail messages may result from marketing initiatives on the Site; however, users may opt-out of receiving marketing messages; see the section below entitled “Communications from the Site and Your Choices.”  


  
Emails from our Site may contain web beacons or “clear .gifs.”  These are small graphic images that can be used for recording when an email has been opened in order to track the performance of email marketing campaigns.  We and our third party service providers currently log responses from web beacons, but this information is not stored or linked to your personal information in our systems.

Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, and to track usage patterns in the Site. We also may collect geo-location information, device identification number and type, computer and connection information, statistics about page views and standard web log information.   We do not correlate this information with data about individual users (though our third-party analytics companies and/or advertisers may do so – see below under “Website Analytics” and “Banner Advertising” for your choices in this regard).  


**7**.  _  Cookies_.  We or our third party advertisers or service providers may use a technology referred to as “cookies” (or other similar technology), which are pieces of data on your computer tied to information about you. Based on your browser type and other information provided by our cookies, we use cookies to: (i) customize certain Site content and access; (ii) track usage patterns on the Site; (iii) allow the Site to remember your user name and password if you so choose; and (iv) for any other purposes permitted under applicable law from time to time.

**  
8\.  ** _General Uses_ **.  ** In addition to the foregoing, we will use your personal information as specifically described on the Site at the time of collection (for example, to share with a charity in the case of your participation in a charity auction).  We may also use your information internally to customize your experience with our company and our Site (for example, adapting the Site to your browser), to help us develop new products and services, to verify your identity, to collect debts or fees owed to us, or to investigate or settle inquiries or disputes, and for other legally required or permissible purposes.  


  
9\. _Website Analytics_ **.  **In addition, we have contracted with a number of third party analytics providers to better help us operate the Site, report Site traffic, statistics and other activities on the Site, specifically including the success of advertising campaigns conducted on the Site, By placing cookies on your computer, these services collect information such as how often you visit the Sites, what pages you visit or what banners you “click through,” and the site you were visiting prior to coming to the Site during your visit.  


  
Each of the analytics service providers we have engaged participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), meaning that the companies have agreed to abide by a set of rules with respect to the application of their services to consumer personal information.  You can visit the DAA site at _<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> _in order to learn about the DAA and to opt-out of the services being used by the Site and block their use of cookies to track your use of the Site and its ad campaigns (as well as your use of all other Internet websites).  


10. _Mobile Devices._   In addition to the information described above, we and our third-party service providers may collect additional information when you utilize any of our mobile applications, including the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID), the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile applications.  


If you utilize any of the location-based services in our mobile applications, such as the functionality that allows you to search for a participating FFL in your area, we and our third-party service providers may collect, use, and share location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. We use such information to provide and improve location-based products and services. You may opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.

II.   _How We Share Your Information_  
**

We do not sell or rent your personal information collected on the Site to non-affiliated third parties unless you have opted in to such sharing.  However, we may share your personal information submitted at the Site among other members of our affiliated group of companies, who may use that information only to the extent consistent with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. For a list of affiliated companies, please contact us at the address listed below under “Contact Us.”

Other than as described in the paragraph above or as specifically described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information collected on the Site with third parties without your permission, except as necessary or appropriate to (i) carry out the transaction, activity or request made by you on the Site or otherwise, (ii) comply with any applicable law, court order or other judicial process, or (iii) enforce or apply agreements with you, or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our affiliates or third parties, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

In the event of a corporate transaction such as a sale, merger or reorganization or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or similar restructuring involving all or a portion of GunBroker.com or its parent and/or affiliate company(ies) (including but not limited to a spinoff of an affiliate, and subsequent acquisition of that affiliate by a new third party), or a sale or transfer of assets, we reserve the right to disclose or transfer your personal information to non-affiliated third party acquiring company(ies) and other third parties.  In the event of such a sale or transfer, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee(s) to use personal information you have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We may collect and share aggregate website statistical information (such as bids, sales, traffic patterns or related information) with third parties.

We hire contractors to provide certain services on our behalf, including trend and statistical analysis, marketing campaigns, information processing and storage, and development of new products and services.  As part of their services to us, these contractors may have access to some or all of the data that we maintain, including transaction data and your personal information, but they are always required to maintain the confidentiality of information they receive from us and are restricted from using the information for any purposes other than those authorized by us.

We do not share your personal information with any third parties for such third parties’ marketing purposes, unless you have opted into such sharing.

Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy Policy only addresses the information that we collect from you, but not about how third parties to whom you disclose your information may use and disclose it.  If you disclose your personal information to third parties such as bidders, buyers and sellers on our Site, other rules may apply to how they use and disclose information provided to them.  We do not police or influence the privacy parties of third parties.  When providing your personal information to third parties, their privacy policies govern their use and disclosure of your personal information.  Before disclosing your personal information to a third party, you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policy.  We also encourage you to disclose your privacy policies to third parties with whom you are dealing through our Site.  When Users transact with each other, they may have access to each other’s name, user id information, email address and other contact information.  By using our Site, you agree to use other Users’ information only for GunBroker transaction-related purposes or other purposes for which a User explicitly chooses.
