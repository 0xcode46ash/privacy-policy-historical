**General**

As used in this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that may be used to identify a specific individual, or that is about an identifiable individual, including but not limited to name, email address, phone number or credit card number. “Aggregate information” refers to combined demographic information which has been derived from personal information but which cannot be reasonably used to identify any individual. 

**I. _Information We Collect On the Site and How We Use It_**

You can visit our Web Site and learn about the services we provide without providing personal information. You do need to provide personal information, however, to sell or bid on items, and to participate in our user forums and other interactive portions of the Site. We do not collect any personal information on the Site unless you provide it voluntarily. However, certain non-personally identifiable information, such as IP address, is collected automatically from every Site visitor, even if not voluntarily provided. 

We collect and use personal information in the specific ways listed below, and generally to improve our Site and services to you, as well as to meet our legal obligations. We also use personal information you provide for other purposes consistent with the reason you provide such information to us. 

**1\. Registration and Auction Information**. Our Site's registration process requires users to provide us valid and accurate contact information including name, address, phone number, birth date and email address (collectively, “Registration Information”). For fraud prevention purposes, users electing to provide as their sole email contact an email address from a free email service provider (such as Yahoo!® Mail, Google® Gmail, or Hotmail®) are required to enter credit card information at the time of registration, and the card is verified by authorizing a small amount through the credit card processing networks. 

In certain circumstances your registration information may be verified through so-called “credit header” information. You may be required to answer a multiple-choice questionnaire compiled from information managed by consumer and business information sources. These questions can include elements from your financial history. This is done as an identity verification and fraud prevention measure. 

We collect certain information submitted during transactions on the Site based on your activities, including bidding, buying and selling, as well as shipping and billing information, and other information you provide in connection with buying or shipping an item (collectively, “Auction Information”).We may also collect certain personal information that you provide through message board discussions, chats, correspondence or dispute resolution. 

Registration Information, Auction Information and other personal information that you provide may be used in the following ways: 

  * For fraud protection at the time of registration;
  * To send you auction-related notifications about transactions you carry out on the Site;
  * If and when you bid on an item, to share your name, address, telephone number, email address and bid information with the seller to facilitate the transaction;
  * If and when you list an item for sale, to share your contact information, including name, address, email address, telephone number and item detail, with bidders to facilitate the transaction;
  * To perform our billing, administration and collections functions (and to contact you when necessary about these functions);
  * To report information about your account, including late payments, missed payments or other delinquencies or defaults on your accounts, to credit reporting bureaus;
  * To communicate with you and carry out actions requested by you (such as subscriptions to newsletters); and
  * When facilitating the investigation of fraud or illegal activity, to share information with law enforcement or other governmental agencies or authorized third parties when requested pursuant to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose you, us or another Site user to legal liability.



Please see “Communications From the Site and Your Choices” below for information on controlling communications from us. 

**2\. Financial Information.** If you list items on the Site, we collect financial information including bank account and/or credit card number, expiration date, card security code and billing address. As noted under “Registration and Auction Information” above, we also collect credit card information from those who register using an email address from a free email provider such as Yahoo!™ Mail or Hotmail™ or Google’s Gmail. Financial information is used to bill you for transactions you carry out on the Site and to collect on fees and debts incurred through the use of the Site. If your account is past due and collection must be pursued, your contact and financial information may be shared with collection agents and/or credit reporting agencies. We share financial information with non-affiliated third parties to facilitate the completion of auction transactions as specified above, to respond to subpoenas, for other legal compliance purposes, and for billing and collections. 

**3\. Contests and Surveys.** If you decide to enter contests or surveys featured from time to time on the Site, you may be asked for personal information in addition to your Registration Information. This information is used in order to administer the contest or survey (for example, to contact the winner) or as otherwise disclosed on the Site at the time we collect the information. 

**4\. Information Requests.** We may ask you to provide personal information in order to allow us to respond to your requests for information or other requests made over the Site. 

**5\. Emails from GunBroker.com.** Any email messages generated by the Site result directly from the User's actions (such as registration information, confirmation of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item, or the user’s choice to subscribe to certain communications), or as necessary to inform you of changes to the Site or events related to the Site, or changes to the Site rules or policies. Users may opt-out of receiving many future mailings; see the section below entitled “Communications from the Site and Your Choices.” 

Emails from our Site may contain web beacons or “clear .gifs.” These are small graphic images that can be used for recording when an email has been opened in order to track the performance of email marketing campaigns. We and our third party service providers currently log responses from web beacons, but this information is not stored or linked to your personal information in our systems. 

**6\. Non-personal information.** We automatically collect your IP address when you visit our Site. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, and to track usage patterns in the Site. We also may collect geo-location information, device identification number and type, computer and connection information, statistics about page views and standard web log information. We do not correlate this information with data about individual users (though our third-party advertisers, if any, identified in this Privacy Policy, may do so – see below under “Third Party Advertising”). 

**7\. Cookies.** We, on our own or in collaboration with our third party partners, may use a technology referred to as “cookies” (or other similar technology), which are pieces of data on your computer tied to information about you. Based on your browser type and other information provided by our cookies, we use cookies to: (i) customize certain Site content and access; (ii) track usage patterns on the Site; (iii) allow the Site to remember your user name and password if you so choose; (iv) enable third parties to target marketing promotions to you (see “Third Party Advertising Below”) and (v) for any other purposes permitted under applicable law from time to time. 

You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies by configuring your preferences option within your web browser. To disable this function in your web browser, choose the “help” menu and follow the instructions for deleting cookies and preventing your browser from downloading additional cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you can still browse our Site, but you may be unable to post on the Site or use the Site as a buyer or seller, or otherwise to access certain aspects of the services available on the Site. We do not store personal or confidential information in cookies (although our third party advertisers may – see below under “Third Party Advertising”) 

**8\. General Uses.** In addition to the foregoing, we will use your personal information as specifically described on the Site at the time of collection (for example, to share with a charity in the case of your participation in a charity auction). We may also use your information internally to customize your experience with our company and our Site (for example, adapting the Site to your browser), to help us develop new products and services, to verify your identity, to collect debts or fees owed to us, or to investigate or settle inquiries or disputes, and for other legally required or permissible purposes. 

**II. _How We Share Your Information_**

We do not sell or rent your personal information collected on the Site to non-affiliated third parties unless you have opted in to such sharing. However, we may share your personal information submitted at the Site among other members of our affiliated group of companies (listed in the introduction), who may use that information only to the extent consistent with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. 

Other than as described in the paragraph above or as specifically described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information collected on the Site with third parties without your permission, except as necessary or appropriate to (i) carry out the transaction, activity or request made by you on the Site, (ii) comply with any applicable law, court order or other judicial process, or (iii) enforce or apply agreements with you, or protect the rights, property or safety of us or third parties, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. 

In the event of a corporate transaction such as a sale, merger or reorganization or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or similar restructuring involving all or a portion of GunBroker.com or its parent and/or affiliate company(ies) (including but not limited to a spinoff of an affiliate, and subsequent acquisition of that affiliate by a new third party), or a sale or transfer of assets, we reserve the right to disclose or transfer your personal information to non-affiliated third party acquiring company(ies) and other third parties. In the event of such a sale or transfer, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee(s) to use personal information you have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may collect and share aggregate website statistical information (such as bids, sales, traffic patterns or related information) with third parties. 

We hire contractors to provide certain services on our behalf, including trend and statistical analysis, information processing and storage, and development of new products and services. As part of their services to us, these contractors may have access to some or all of the data that we maintain, including transaction data and your personal information, but they are always required to maintain the confidentiality of information they receive from us and are restricted from using the information for any purposes other than those authorized by us. 

We do not share your personal information with any third parties for such third parties’ marketing purposes, unless you have opted into such sharing. 

Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy Policy only addresses the information that we collect from you, but not about how third parties to whom you disclose your information may use and disclose it. If you disclose your personal information to third parties such as bidders, buyers and sellers on our Site, other rules may apply to how they use and disclose information provided to them. We do not police or influence the privacy parties of third parties. When providing your personal information to third parties, their privacy policies govern their use and disclosure of your personal information. Before disclosing your personal information to a third party, you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policy. We also encourage you to disclose your privacy policies to third parties with whom you are dealing through our Site. When Users transact with each other, they may have access to each other’s name, user id information, email address and other contact information. By using our Site, you agree to use other Users’ information only for GunBroker transaction-related purposes or other purposes for which a User explicitly chooses. 

**III. _Communications From the Site and Your Choices_**

The Site sends three types of email communications: (1) notifications related to auction activity, (2) 'Saved Search' notifications, and (3) opt-in newsletters and promotional email messages. 

(1) Auction Activity. Notifications related to auction activity are generated as a result or registering as a user of the Site, bidding on items, or listing items for sale. These notifications can include bid confirmations, winning bidder notices, item listing confirmations, item sold notifications, monthly statements, billing messages, and other notifications related to activity on the Site. **You cannot opt out of receiving notifications related to auction activity** ; however, if you do not bid nor list items and your account balance is zero you will not receive any such notifications from the Site. 

If you are a registered buyer or seller on the Site we may send you certain notices, such as notices of a substantial change in the policies and/or operation of the Site. **These notices are sent infrequently and cannot be opted out of other than by closing your account with us.**

(2) Saved Search. Saved Search notifications are generated at your request to inform you when items matching certain search criteria have been listed on the Site. There are removal instructions at the bottom of every such notification message. You can delete your saved searches to stop receiving the notifications by going to [My GunBroker](http://www.gunbroker.com/MySite/MySummary.aspx) then clicking [Saved Searches](http://www.gunbroker.com/MySite/MyAuctions/Searches.aspx). Removal instructions appear on that page. 

(3) Promotional Messages. Opt-in newsletters and promotional email messages are mailing lists that you choose to subscribe to during auction registration or by using various opt-in pages or forms on the Site. You may change your preferences for these promotional messages at any time by logging into [My GunBroker](http://www.gunbroker.com/MySite/MySummary.aspx) and visiting the [Preferences](http://www.gunbroker.com/MySite/MyAccount/Preferences.aspx) page to update them. All such lists are 100% opt-in; in other words you will never receive any newsletter or promotional email from the Site unless you have specifically elected to be on the applicable email list. You may opt out of these mailings at any time and we have made it very easy to do so. To opt out of future newsletter or promotional email [click here](http://www.gunbroker.com/MySite/MyAccount/Preferences.aspx) and follow the instructions on the subsequent pages. 

**IV. _Children’s Privacy_**

The Site is not intended for or directed to persons less than 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our services to children. If you are under 18 years of age, do not use the Site. 

**V. _For Persons Outside the United States_**

By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein. You agree that by using the Site, your personal data will be transferred to GunBroker.com servers located in the United States in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. You understand that the laws with respect to the protection of personal data in the United States may not be as stringent as those in your home jurisdiction. 

**VI. _Security_**

The Site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you submit sensitive information via our Sites, such as credit card information, that information is subject to secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption technology. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information during transmission, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), log out of your account after use, and close your web browser. If you do share your password or personal information with anyone, you are responsible for all actions taken in your account’s name. If you lose control of your password, you may lose considerable control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Because of this, if the security of your password has been compromised in any way, you are responsible for immediately notifying us and for changing your password. 

You can review your personal information by logging into our Site, and you should act to update it promptly upon changes in your personal information or to correct any errors in it. You might not be able to alter or delete a public posting once you make it. At your request, we will close your account and make your personal information not publicly viewable as soon as reasonably possible, in accordance with applicable law.
