As our official privacy policy, your information will be kept completely confidential. We will never sell or give out any of your personal information to anyone, including but not limited to email addresses, names, locations, IP addresses, and game account names. 

In the event of a contest where it becomes necessary to obtain your personal information, that information will either be destroyed after it is no longer necessary or stored in a secure, non-electronic place for your future use in contests if you so desire. 

While we are not responsible for information that you make publicly available on the forum, we will always work to protect your privacy. In the case where local, national, or international law becomes an issue, any of your information will be kept confidential except that information that is specifically required by law. 

We reserve the right to change any or all parts or the privacy policy at any time, and those changed policies will apply retroactively.
