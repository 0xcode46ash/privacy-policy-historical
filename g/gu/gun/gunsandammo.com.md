# GunBroker.com Privacy Policy

Our site's registration form requires users to give us valid and accurate contact information (like your name and email address) and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers). The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services and to collect on debts incurred through the use of this site. Other than to facilitate the completion of an auction transaction as specified below or for billing and collections purposes, contact and financial information is never shared with any third party.

If you place a bid on an item, your contact information including name, address, email, and telephone number may be shared with the seller to facilitate the transaction. If you list an item for sale, your contact information including name, address, email, and telephone number may be shared with the bidder(s) to facilitate the transaction. To facilitate the investigation of fraud or illegal activity we may turn information over to bona-fide law enforcement agencies.

If you incur fees through the use of this site we use your contact information and financial information for billing and collections purposes. If your account is past due and collection must be pursued, your contact and financial information may be shared with collection agents and/or credit reporting agencies. Other than to collect debts we do not share your financial information with any third party.

We do not do unsolicited mailings. Any email messages generated by GunBroker.com result directly from the user's actions (such as registration information, confirmation of placing a bid, confirmation of listing an item), or as necessary to inform you of changes to the auction site or events related to the auction site, or changes to the auction site rules. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information, and to track usage patterns in the GunBroker.com site. We do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We use cookies for the same purpose. Under no circumstances do we store personal or confidential information in cookies. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. We do not do unsolicited mailing to users who register for our contests.
