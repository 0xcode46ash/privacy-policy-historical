# Guru.com - Privacy Policy

**Your confidentiality is important to us.**

Guru.com is firmly committed to the privacy of its members. 

**Overview**

The information contained within the member profile you register is solely used to match posted information with potential professionals or projects. Employer and professional contact information is NEVER released to third parties of any kind. Professional profiles are displayed in search results listings WITHOUT contact information. Professional contact information is only revealed to employers AFTER professionals proactively submit bids and proposals to projects. Employer contact information is never revealed to professionals. 

Registered Guru.com employers and professionals can be assured that none of the information submitted to Guru.com will ever be sold or redistributed without express consent. 

**Information Collection and Use**

Guru.com is a Web-based marketplace that directly connects businesses with freelancers. Guru.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Guru.com will not provide any personally identifying information on individual members to any third party, except in connection with possible employment, with the professional's consent, as explained below. 

All registered Guru.com members click the "I AGREE" checkbox on the Registration form to agree to the Guru.com Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Registered professionals on Guru.com agree that some profile information is made accessible to employers who conduct searches of the Guru.com database. This information includes professionals' skills, experience, education level, compensation, work availability, region, self-evaluation, and member statistics. Such information does not identify the specificity of the individual member. 

Guru.com will contact the professionals who match employer postings via a Project Notification email. At that point, the professional has the option to submit a bid and proposal for the project and disclose his/her personal information (i.e. name, address and phone number) to the potential employer. When a professional submits a bid and proposal for a project, the employer receives the information in his/her employer account on Guru.com and by email. The professional's contact information is only revealed to the employer AFTER he/she submits a bid and proposal for the project. 

**Registration**

To be a registered Guru.com member, employers and professionals must first complete the registration form. During registration, employers and professionals are required to provide their contact information (i.e. name, address, phone number and email address). This information is used to match professional profiles with employer project requirements. Any and all information provided will not be given/sold to third parties and is completely confidential. The professional's contact information is only revealed to the employer AFTER he/she submits a bid and proposal for the project. Employer contact information is never revealed to professionals. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are text files that websites use to capture information about the members using their sites. Guru.com uses cookies to recognize the information registered professionals and employers provide on our website. (For example, a registered member logs out of Guru.com. The member returns to Guru.com to log into the website. The member's username already appears in the login form, and the member is only required to enter their password to login.) Guru.com members must have cookies enabled on their browser(s). Cookie preferences are set within each browser's Internet options/preferences. 

Should Guru.com allow advertisers on the website, some of these advertisers may use cookies. Guru.com will have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**

Guru.com logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. This information is used to diagnose server problems, monitor traffic patterns, analyze trends, administer the website, track member user patterns, and identify the most popular areas of the website to deliver content most relevant to registered members. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information and are only used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, except in the case of fraud. 

**Sharing**

Should Guru.com share aggregated demographic information with partners and/or advertisers, such information will not be linked to personal information that identifies individual members. 

**Links**

Guru.com contains links to other websites and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. Guru.com encourages its members to read the privacy policies of all websites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Guru.com. 

**Security**

Guru.com takes every precaution to protect registered member information. When professionals and employers submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and offline. 

Guru.com is a VeriSign Secure Site. Please click the VeriSign logo at the bottom of any page in the website to view our official VeriSign certificate. All transactions performed through Guru.com are conducted in a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) session. The Secure Socket Layer encrypts all transaction data for transmittal in a format that prevents data theft. This process protects all private information from being disclosed to third parties. While on a secure page, the lock icon at the bottom of a Web browser (i.e. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked. 

While Guru.com uses encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect member information offline. All member information is restricted within our offices. Servers used to store personally identifiable information are housed in a secure, supervised environment. In addition, only Guru.com employees who need specific information to perform a task are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are current with our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, employees are notified and reminded about the importance of privacy, and what they can do to ensure the protection of sensitive member information. 

If you have any questions about Guru.com website security, please send an email to [privacy@guru.com](mailto:privacy@guru.com). 

**Mandatory Communications**

Guru.com sends all newly registered members a welcome email to verify their email addresses. At times, Guru.com sends service announcements to its registered employers and professionals. Members cannot unsubscribe from service announcements that discuss upcoming changes that affect their Guru.com accounts. In addition, we communicate with registered members via personal emails or phone calls to provide requested services. 

**Optional Communications**

Established employers and professionals receive monthly e-newsletters containing information on Guru.com products, services and announcements. Occasionally, registered members receive e-postcards that highlight special Guru.com announcements and features. Registered members can opt-out of the above listed communications. Please see our Choice/Opt-out section below. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Upon registration, employers and professionals can opt-out of our monthly e-newsletters and e-postcards containing service announcements. At any time, members can modify their Guru.com email (service announcement) preferences by updating their account information. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

Registered employers and professionals may correct and update their personal data listed on Guru.com. In addition, members who desire to opt-out of our service may delete their accounts at any time. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we alter our Privacy Policy, we will post all changes in the Employer and Professional Announcement areas. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different than what was stated at the time of user registration, we will notify members via email. At that time, members can choose whether or not Guru.com may use their information in this different manner.
