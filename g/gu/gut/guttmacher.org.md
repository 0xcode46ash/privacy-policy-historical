# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy \--Updated June 13, 2003

AGI has created this privacy statement to demonstrate the Institute's commitment to protecting personal information gathered in the course of visits to this Web site. 

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

You do not have to provide personally identifying information to visit our site. If you choose not to provide personal information when prompted, you can still visit most of our web pages pages. 

We may collect personally identifiable information (name, email address, physical address and other unique identifiers) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. Personally identifying information collected will be used only in connection with our Web site, or for such purposes as are described at the point of collection, (e.g. purchase transactions, requests for printed materials, list serve signup, requests for download permission of selected online content.) Personally identifying information may also be used to gather broad demographic information about our user community and/or to perform analyses of user behavior in order to measure visitor interest in specific areas of the Web site. 

In no case will anyone's email address be shared (disclosed, given, sold or traded) with any third party. In no case will anyone's personal information be shared (disclosed, given, sold or traded) with any third party other than AGI's agents (such as a credit card processor) without the user's explicit permission. 

**COOKIES**

This Web site uses cookies in three ways. 

The web server generates a session ID cookie for the purpose of generating usage statistics. This cookie is not associated with any user profiles and expires after one month. 

The AGI shopping cart uses a cookie to keep track of items and quantities in the users shopping cart. This cookie expires when the order is successfully completed, the shopping cart is emptied, or--if neither of the former occur--in one week. 

In some cases a user ID cookie is issued for users who have registered to access certain resources, so that they are not prompted to re-register on subsequent visits. 

**OPT-IN POLICY**

AGI follows a strict opt-in policy; that is, you must affirmatively choose to receive information from the Institute, and list serve subscribers always have the option of discontinuing further communication by going to [www.guttmacher.org/listserv/index.html](https://web.archive.org/listserv/index.html). 

**SECURITY**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is backed up daily to prevent loss of data. 

You should be aware that transmissions through the Internet to and from this Web site, including e-mail messages sent to AGI, are not confidential, and your communications may be read or intercepted. In some instances, including any time you are asked to provide credit card information to order products or make donations through this Web site, information is sent in a commercially secure (encrypted) form, which significantly limits the possibility that this information may be read by others. 

**POLICY REVISIONS**

We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our web site. You may prevent your information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by contacting us at the below address. 

**ACCESS AND CORRECTION OF VISITOR DATA**

Upon request we will provide access to the information that we maintain about you. You can request this information by e-mailing us at the below address. You may request corrections to or deletion of your information by sending a detailed email containing your request to that address. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please contact [info@guttmacher.org](mailto:info@guttmacher.org).
