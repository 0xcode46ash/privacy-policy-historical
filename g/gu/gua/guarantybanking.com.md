# GuarantyBank | Privacy Policy

Guaranty Bank (which does business in Michigan and Georgia under the trade name “BestBank”) and its subsidiaries, collectively “Guaranty”, understands that we receive private, personal information about our customers that they expect will be treated confidentially (“Nonpublic Personal Information”). We believe that we have an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect and protect the privacy of all our customers by maintaining the confidentiality of this information. Guaranty has implemented this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to govern the management of our customer’s Nonpublic Personal Information, including information provided to us on our Internet websites.

## Basic Principles

We respect our current and former customer’s right to keep all personal information confidential and secure from fraud.

We collect and retain personal information only if allowed by law and do not sell Nonpublic Personal Information to any Nonaffiliated Third Parties (defined below) for any purpose

We only disclose Nonpublic Personal Information about a customer to Nonaffiliated Third Parties in limited circumstances as permitted by law.

We do not disclose account numbers to any Nonaffiliated Third Parties for telemarketing, direct mail marketing or electronic mail marketing.

We have established standards and procedures to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the customer.

We educate and train our employees on the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy.

We may share Nonpublic Personal Information among Affiliates subject to federal and state laws. Affiliate means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Guaranty.
