# Guardian Unlimited | Information | Privacy policy

At Guardian Unlimited we collect information about our users for two main reasons:

 **1.** To help us continually improve the services we offer.

 **2.** To use the details of our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site, and so continue to keep Guardian Unlimited free for all our users.

 **Our principles**

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior consent. We have also established the following four principles:

 **1.** We will continue to invest in the best quality security available and do our utmost to protect user privacy.

 **2.** We will respect your email privacy. You will receive unsolicited mail from the Guardian only if you have agreed to this.

 **3.** We will not pass on any individual user details (including your email address) unless we have your prior consent.

**4.** Otherwise, we will only share aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers.

 **What information do we collect?**

We collect some basic information from all of our users. This includes your name, email address, postcode and date of birth. Please note that once you have registered at any one of our sites you will have access to them all.

We also ask some further, voluntary questions so we can gain a clearer understanding of our users. Your responses help us to sell appropriate advertising space and so keep the site free. They also enable us to personalise services for our users.

We collect data listing which of our pages are most frequently visited and by which types of users.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for personal details and email address.

 **FAQs**

 **How does Guardian Unlimited protect customer information?**

We invest in the best quality security available and do our upmost to protect user privacy. UK Data Protection Legislation means we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. 

**Why does Guardian Unlimited use 'cookies'?**

'Cookies' are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. They make it possible for us to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our sites. Using cookies makes accessing our sites more convenient as you don't need to remember your username and password each time you enter.

 **Will Guardian Unlimited disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

Guardian Unlimited will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. Also, Guardian Unlimited may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Guardian Unlimited follow the relevant legal requirements and use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information, however we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.

Any changes to our policy will be posted here.
