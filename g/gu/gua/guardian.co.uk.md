# Guardian Unlimited | Information | Privacy policy

At Guardian Unlimited we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons:

1\. To help us to improve the services we offer.

2\. To provide personalised services unique to individual users.

3\. To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many female users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser.

Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.

 **Our principles**

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior consent. We have also established the following four principles:

1\. We will continue to invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user privacy through the use of the latest security technology.

2\. We will respect your email privacy. You will receive unsolicited mail from the Guardian only if you have agreed to this.

3\. We will not pass on any individual user details (including your email address) unless we have your prior consent.

4\. Otherwise, we will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers. 

Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users with the new details.

We also offer a "user profile page", which enables you to update your personal information at any time. You can get to this "profile page" from most pages on the site - simply click on the link "Your profile" when you are signed in.

 **What information do we collect?**

We collect information on our users in two ways: through cookies, and through registration. For more information about cookies, please see below.

The minimum information we need to register a user is a username and/or an email address, and a password. Other information we may ask for from time to time (for instance, when a user wishes to enter a contest or other promotional feature) includes full name, postcode and date of birth. We also ask some further, voluntary questions so we can gain a clearer understanding of our users. Your responses help us to sell appropriate advertising space and so keep the site free. They also enable us to personalise services for our users. We do not share this "additional" information with third parties unless you have consented to this.

We also collect data listing which of our pages are most frequently visited and by which types of users.

 **Why does Guardian Unlimited use 'cookies'?**

'Cookies' are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. They make it possible for us to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access one of our sites. Using cookies makes accessing our sites more convenient as you don't need to remember your username and password each time you enter.

Occasionally, we may also use cookies to track registered or unregistered users as they travel through the site - for instance, we might use cookies to count the total number of unique users who are accessing the site over a particular period of time, or to ensure that you don't see a particular advert more than once. This information will never be shared with a third party, and is only used to make our systems more efficient.

Finally, some advertising on the site is served by third parties such as Doubleclick. Occasionally, these third parties will serve cookies on your browser as well, for instance to gauge the effectiveness of a particular advertisement. Please note: This will not enable these third parties to access your personal details.

If you are concerned about cookies, you can turn them off in your browser. However, if you do this please note that some areas of the site may not work properly.

 **How does Guardian Unlimited protect customer information?**

We invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user privacy. UK Data Protection Legislation means we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. 

**Will Guardian Unlimited disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

Guardian Unlimited will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. Also, Guardian Unlimited may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Guardian Unlimited follows the relevant legal requirements and use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information, however we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users.
