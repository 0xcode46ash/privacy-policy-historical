## Guardian Industries Corp. Internet Privacy Statement

Guardian regards the safeguarding of Internet privacy as a serious matter. Although we do collect information about the visitors to our web sites, the amount and type of information gathered depends upon how you use our web sites. Any personally identifiable information provided by you will be treated with the utmost respect for your privacy.

Normal Web Usage  
When you visit a Guardian web site, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis. This information may include the name of your Internet service provider, the web site that referred you to our web site, the pages you requested, the length of time of your request, and the date and time of your requests. We use this collected information to generate statistics and measure web site activity to improve the usefulness of your visits. During normal web site visits, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone numbers, or social security number.

Web Site Interaction  
There are times when Guardian will require personal information about you in order to satisfy your Internet request to receive product literature, subscribe to Guardian’s newsletter, place an order, track an order, submit a resume, or otherwise correspond with one of our business units. You will be prompted for this information (name, mailing address, email address, type of request, etc.) at the time of your request. This information will be collected and stored in an appropriate manner and will be used to fulfill your request. You provide such information on a voluntary basis; failure to do so may result in the impossibility to satisfy your request. If you tell us that the information should not be used as a basis for further communications, we will respect your desire for privacy. The information you provide to Guardian is used by us to improve the services we provide to you and to other potential visitors to our web sites. The information will not be shared outside of Guardian and Guardian’s subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved in your web site interaction.

When you submit personally identifiable information to Guardian, you understand that you are agreeing to allow Guardian, its subsidiaries and its affiliates, to access, store, and use the data in any of the countries where Guardian does business. Subject to the acquisition of your relevant consent, when necessary, Guardian may use the personal information you submit for any purpose related to Guardian’s conduct of business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting marketing research, improving products and services, sending you surveys, notifying you of new products, and any other changes within Guardian that may affect you.

Data subject’s rights  
You have the right to obtain: access to your data; confirmation as to whether or not data relating to you are being processed and information as to the purposes of the processing, the categories of data concerned and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed; disclosure to you in an intelligible form of the data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source; knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing of data concerning you. You also have the right to object at any time, for compelling and legitimate reasons, to the processing of any data on you except in cases where legal provisions expressly provide for that processing. You can exercise your rights by contacting Guardian at this [email address](mailto:info@guardian.com). Of course, you also have the ability to adjust your web browser security settings accordingly to prevent any cookies from being stored on your device.

Security  
Guardian understands your concern for security and will use reasonable efforts to establish secure connections with you and to limit access to Guardian databases containing personal information to only authorized Guardian personnel.

Disclaimers  
Although Guardian will protect the privacy of personal information submitted through its web sites, Guardian will comply with requests for information or subpoenas from government officials or law enforcement officers that may require the disclosure of personal information or communications with Guardian.

Guardian reserves the right to modify its Privacy Statement as business needs warrant, or in our attempt to better serve your needs. Guardian will use reasonable efforts to publish any changes to its Internet Privacy Statement.
