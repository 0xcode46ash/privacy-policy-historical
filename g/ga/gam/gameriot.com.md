# GameRiot :: Privacy Policy

  
Games Media Properties requests but does not require users to register for GameRiot updates and to provide certain personal information including name, email address and personal information related to gaming traits and preferences. Games Media Properties uses this information to deliver better service and special offers to the individual. Games Media Properties may use this information to contact registrants to notify them of product and service updates, and to deliver other service related information. Games Media Properties may also contact registrants to request additional information and feedback. If you wish to be removed from such secondary mailings you may do so by sending an email to info@gameriot.com with “unsubscribe” in the subject line. 

Games Media Properties may employ companies and people to perform tasks on its behalf, and will need to share personal information with these agents to deliver service or information to the individual. Games Media Properties’ agents do not receive any right to use personal information beyond what is necessary to perform these tasks. Games Media Properties will not disclose registration information to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Games Media Properties, without your express opt-in or as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.  
If at some point Games Media Properties sells all or a portion of its assets, customer information is one of those assets that would be transferred or acquired by a third party; the third party would then have the right to continue using the personal information as set forth in this policy. For more information see our Privacy Policy Changes section below. 

Games Media Properties may release or exchange personal information if required to do so to comply with applicable law or to enforce its rights or agreements or prevent fraud or reduce credit risk. In addition, Games Media Properties may contact you to inform you of updates or new features. 

Games Media Properties also collects, tracks and analyzes information that does not personally identify a user but rather is used in an aggregate form. This aggregate data will be used at Games Media Properties’ discretion and may be shared with third parties, but with no personally identifiable information attached. Games Media Properties will not review, share, distribute or reference such data except as may be required to provide the requested Games Media Properties services, or as provided in the Games Media Properties Terms of Use Agreement, or as may be required by law. 

If a registrants’ personally identifiable information changes or if a registrant no longer desires to receive Games Media Properties information, we provide a way to delete/deactivate registrants’ information. This can be done emailing our customer support at info@gameriot.com.
