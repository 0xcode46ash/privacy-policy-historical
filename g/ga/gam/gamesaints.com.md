www.areae.net, www.metaplace.com

In addition, we own many other domain names (e.g. www.metaplace.org) that may redirect to the home page of the of the Sites.

From time to time, we may add new Sites that may not be listed above, but they will provide a link to this Policy and will be governed by its terms.

### Our policies concerning children

Areae complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet.

### Children under the age of 13

If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site, you may not sign up for any subscription service or buy anything through the Sites. Except as may be required by law, Areae will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13.

### Kids between the ages of 13 and 18

If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please let your parent or guardian know about this Policy and get his or her permission before you give us any of your personal identifiable information, before you use any of our message board or chat features, before you sign up for any subscription services, and before you buy anything from the Sites. Don't post your real name on a web site or message board, and never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family, including your phone number and address. Use screen names at all times. Some areas of the Site may have special rules for children under the age of 18. When you are in those areas, you must follow those rules.

### Information for Parents/Guardians

Areae encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the Internet, including our online games. Parents and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids.

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or consent, Areae will take reasonable steps to remove that information from the Areae database at your request. To request removal of your child's information, please send us an e-mail to contact@areae.net and be sure to include in your message your contact information.

### What personal information we collect from you

We do not collect any personal information from you, unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you decide to provide us your personal information (e.g., name, email address, and mailing address), we will collect only the personal information which is needed to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you refuse to divulge your personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain areas on the Sites (such as chat rooms and message boards).

### Memberships and Registration

In order for you to register with the Site, we require you to provide us with an email address, state and country of residence, zip/postal code, birth date and gender; we allow you to elect whether to also provide your real name. Some areas of the Sites may allow you to visit as a guest and remain anonymous, but you may not be able to access all the content and features of those areas without registering (in order to play subscription based games, additional information, such as your real name and billing information, will be required).

You may be asked to choose a user or member name and password. Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a user name. Please note that your user name will be available to the Internet's general public while you participate in some services, like chat rooms or message boards, so you should exercise discretion when using these services. Personal information disclosed by you within our chat areas, instant message service, message boards, or during game play can be collected by other users of such services and may result in unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through our services (e.g. sending your telephone number to another user through the chat service). To the extent that you create a public profile that may be available to others on our sites and services, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy at all times. To edit, change, or delete such information, follow the instructions on the web site.

### Email Newsletters 

You must have a membership account in order to receive emails from us. You may be asked for additional personal information when you subscribe. You can opt out of receiving future emailing from us by following the directions contained in the email to "unsubscribe." 

### Online Games

When you play any of the games offered and/or served by Areae, or use any of the communication features on the Sites, your IP address (the Internet protocol address from which you access any of the above) may be stored in our records. 

When you log into one of our online games, your system specifications (such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system configuration, etc.) may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of analyzing and optimizing your game experience and in order to provide you with customer service.

### What non-personal information we collect from you

General, aggregated, demographic, and non-personal information may be collected by Areae. It will not be linked to any of your personal information, through cookies or other means, without your consent. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data may include information that you have provided to us through surveys, polls, etc., but will not be tied to any personal information, without your consent. It may also include aggregated anonymous information about site usage and the customer base.

As part of the registration process for some services, you may be asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. For example, you may be asked to provide information concerning your entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. This information is generally optional but may be included in your account profile and tied to personal information. Areae requests this information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you.

In many cases, Areae will automatically collect certain non-personal information about your use of its sites and services. Areae might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your "click path" through the Sites, and the web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Sites when you visited. To do this, Areae may use cookies and other technology. Your visits to our web sites, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with personal information or have provided such information in the past. For example, if you've created a membership account, your account information (including name, email address, and billing and shipping information) may be linked to the items you purchased at our online store (i.e., purchase order history).

### Information on cookies and related technology

Areae web sites, and some services and advertisements on such sites, may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. 

Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Areae web sites and services may not function properly.

Areae does not control cookies in third party ads, and visitors are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The ads appearing on our Web sites may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

### How we use and share the information that we collect from you

Personal information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Policy. 

When you have provided personal information to us for a particular purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request. This may include, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction managers, credit verification services, and other third party service providers. We may also disclose any of your personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of Areae.

We may use the information we collect from you for the purpose of providing you with technical support, customer service, and account maintenance. We use the information we collect to learn what you like, tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve web sites and our other products. We send e-mail to our members who want to receive e-mail from us. However, if you don't want to receive e-mail from us, you can "opt out" of receiving it at the time you register as a member on our web sites or each time we request information from you. If you change your mind and wish to stop receiving e-mails from us, you may also choose to opt out by following the steps described in each such e-mail.

Except as described in this policy, we will not give any of your personal information to any third party without your express approval. We sometimes share general, demographic, or aggregated (not personal) information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personal information.

You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Sites, of any personal information contained in the Areae database for such site, if Areae assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your personal information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of Areae's assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event.

Other important agreements that govern your use of our sites and services

In addition to this Policy, your rights and obligations concerning our web sites, services, and online games are governed by the applicable web site terms of service, the applicable game's end user license agreement and/or terms of use, and other applicable policies, guidelines, and requirements. When you sign up to use our services, please review each such agreement carefully, as you must agree to be bound by each such agreement before you may use the service.

### Information for persons outside the United States

By consenting to this Policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein.

For persons in European Union countries, as used herein, terms such as "personal information" refer to "personal data" as defined by the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("Directive"). We will not collect any personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing us with your freely given specific and informed consent. By using Areae websites or services, you agree that we may transfer your personal information outside the European Union in connection with the purposes stated in this Policy. Your personal data may be transferred to the United States (and/or other non-EU jurisdictions, as applicable).

### Our commitment to secure the personal information we have collected

While Areae takes precautions against possible breaches in its web sites and customer databases, no web site or Internet transmission is completely secure. Consequently, Areae cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the Areae sites and services is at your own risk. Areae urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser.

Areae employs a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of critical account information to the site. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.

### Notice of changes to the Policy

Areae reserves the right to change this Policy at any time by notifying registered users via e-mail of the existence of a new Policy and/or posting the new Policy on the Sites. All changes to the Policy will be effective when posted, and your continued use of any Areae site or service after the posting will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
