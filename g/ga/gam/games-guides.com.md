At MgrCentral Pty Ltd we understand the importance of your privacy. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use our services and sites, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information.

We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us.

**Personal information and other data collected**

  * We collect personal information, such as your name, email address or other information when you register for an account or otherwise voluntarily provide such information. 
  * MgrCentral may use cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use our services in order to improve the quality of our services, including tracking your progress in the lessons. 
  * Our servers automatically record information when you visit our sites or use some of our services, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request. 
  * We do not store credit card, bank account or other financial data.



**Uses**

  * We may use personal information to provide the services you have requested, including services that display customized content and advertising. 
  * We may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve our products and services. 
  * We will never sell or provide any information you provide us to any third party, unless under requirement of a court order. You do need to be aware that we are an Australian company and via Australia's special relationship with the United States and the European Union (and the owner's respect for the United States of America and the European Union) we will honour any court imposed request by either an Australian Court, a United States Court or a European Union Court to turn over any information held. 
  * MgrCentral processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in Australia and all data is protected behind firewalls and data protection processes are used in all cases to ensure your data remains safe.
  * If you delete your account at MgrCentral your details are completely erased from our databases.



**Your choices**

  * We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. 
  * You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result. 
  * We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible. 



If anything comes to your attention which could potentially be a violation of this policy, please notify usÂ immediately so that we can investigate it and try to correct it.
