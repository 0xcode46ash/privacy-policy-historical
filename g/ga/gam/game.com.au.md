Privacy Policy

**Respecting your privacy and upholding the law**  
The privacy and security of your personal information has always been of the utmost importance to us at Gameswizards. We are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) and any relevant Privacy Principles under NSW state legislation, as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff are trained to respect your privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures.

Gameswizards is TGW Pty. Limited along with any other subsidiaries, franchise operations or members of the Gameswizards retail organisation.

**About this privacy policy  
** This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and manage personal information provided to us by our customers.

This document also describes the sorts of information held and for what purposes, as well as how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed. 

Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether at one of our retail stores, through our 1300 131 670 number or via our website and/or e-mail transmissions.

We encourage you to check www.gameswizards.com regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy.

**Collecting your personal information**     
Depending on the product or service obtained, Gameswizards will collect and hold your personal information for the purposes of:

  * Monitoring sales data/history with the intention of providing special offers or loyalty discounts.
  * Managing and administering the product or service obtained from Gameswizards. 



Your personal information may also be collected for the purpose of letting you know about products or services offered by Gameswizards that might interest you along with promotions or other opportunities in which you may be interested.

The information collected includes, but is not limited to, your name, postal or email address, phone number(s), date of birth, transaction history with Gameswizards or other information the organisation considers necessary.

We will only collect your personal information directly from you. This may happen whenever you purchase a product or service, or submit an administrative form (eg a change of address form), or when you give us personal information over the telephone or counter, or via our website.   


**Using and disclosing your personal information     
**The Gameswizards will not disclose your personal information to any external party or individual under any circumstances unless required to by Federal or State laws where applicable. Any information obtained by us is stored on stand-alone computer equipment not connected to a network or Internet connection. From time to time, we may approach you on behalf of a third-party vendor or supplier. Rest assured that your details have not been forwarded to any other parties outside Gameswizards, as all correspondence (including data compilation, layout, printing and mailing) is done in-house. ****

**Marketing practices and ethics**     
It is our practice to seek your consent to use your personal information in order to let you know about, and develop, products and services that might better serve your needs or promotions or other opportunities in which you may be interested. This may be done after your initial contact with us. At the point of initial contact, a Gameswizards representative will ask you whether you wish to receive correspondence from us on a regular basis. Should you wish to be removed from any future mailing lists at a later date, or simply do not want to be contacted by us, please notify your closest Gameswizards store on 1300 131 670.

  * Access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual.
  * Access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others.
  * A frivolous or vexatious request.
  * The information relates to a commercially sensitive decision making process.
