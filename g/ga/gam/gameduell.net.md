### PRIVACY POLICY

**GAMEDUELL IS COMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY**

We value Your patronage and respect Your privacy rights. As part of the normal operation of Our services, We collect and, in some cases, may disclose information about You. We have created the following Privacy Policy to let You know what information We collect when You visit Our Website, why We collect it, and how it is used. This Privacy Policy applies to all information that You provide to GameDuell, Inc. ("Us," "We," or "Our") and that We maintain electronically, whether You provide the information through Our Website located at www.gameduell.com (the "Website"), or through other means. Additionally, this Privacy Policy applies to any Personal Information (defined below) obtained from Your use of the Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that You may provide to third parties; for example, other sites linked to this Website. You should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective privacy policies.

This Privacy Policy is governed by Our Terms and Conditions. GameDuell reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. In such an event, GameDuell will send You an email containing the revised terms or a notification containing a link to where the revised terms can be viewed on the Website at least two (2) weeks before they go into effect. GameDuell may also send notice of the revisions to You using the GameDuell messaging service. If You do not expressly object to the validity of the new terms and conditions via e-mail within this two (2) week period, then the newly revised Privacy Policy will be considered agreed upon. If You reject the newly revised Privacy Policy, then GameDuell may terminate its relationship with You. If You believe We have not adhered to this Privacy Policy or if You have any other questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact Us at [privatepolicy@gameduell.com](mailto:privatepolicy@gameduell.com).

However, We hereby advise all visitors to Our site under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any Personal Information on Our Website. In the event that We discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Us, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission's Website at www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy for more information about this Act), We will delete the child's Personal Information from Our files to the extent technologically possible.

Each time You interact with Our Website, the details of Your interaction are collected and retained by Us.

We intend to retain any correspondence, including facsimiles, mail and e-mails, set to Us. We also may retain correspondence such as customer service e-mails from Us to You, and photocopy of Your ID or Passport (when applicable). We may delete such records over time.
  * Use of IP Address  
IP addresses are numbers that are automatically assigned to Your computer, and, if associated with other individually identifiable information, could be considered personal information. Your user IP address information is used only for Our internal tracking and marketing purposes.
  * Use of Cookies  
In order for Us to provide You with the best possible service on Our Website, Your browser must accept cookies, as they are essential for site administration and security. We do not use cookies either to collect individually identifiable information or to collect non-individually identifiable information using a cookie that is combined with a personal identifier. 



WHAT GENERAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND WHY?

"General Information" is information about You or Your activities on Our Website that do not identify You personally. When You use the Internet, Your Web browser or software may communicate certain information to the host Website You visit. This information may include the unique number assigned to Your server or Internet connection, the capabilities and features of Your computer, You geographic location, and Your movement and activity within a particular Website. We collect the same information on Our Website. We use this General Information to generate statistics about visitors to Our Website.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

The information We collect is used to (i) to respond to Your inquiries; (ii) provide customer services and resolve any complaints; (iii) improve the Website and service and resolve any technical problems; (iv) communicate with You concerning the services offered on the Website by Us or any of Our Partners; (v) cross-reference with other Personal Information that We have acquired about You or may acquire about You through other sources; (vi) create aggregate data; (vii) ensure compliance with the Website Terms of use; and (viii) comply with any applicable laws and regulations. We may provide Your information to government officials and agencies as required by law, and Partners as part of business operations, transaction processing, and marketing efforts, as identified below. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Partner" shall mean any person or entity with whom We enter into any kind of business transaction who is under an obligation to Us to use reasonable care to keep Personal Information confidential.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, We will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any Personal Information obtained by Us through this Website or from Our Partners about You, without Your consent. We may disclose Personal Information (i) to companies that help process the transactions You request, in order to protect Your transactions from fraud and verify Your identity; (ii) that We in good faith believe is necessary or appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose Us or You to legal liability, or to conduct investigations of violations of the Website Terms of use; (iii) when required by law or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (iv) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities (including, without limitation, requests from the governmental agency authorities to view Your Personal Information); (v) to protect and defend Us, Our subsidiaries and affiliates and any of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (vi) to prevent imminent physical harm; (vii) to share aggregated statistical or demographic data with Our affiliates, business partners or for public relations (this aggregated information is not tied to Personal Information); (viii) to provide data, including Personal Information about You, with Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and Partners; (ix) to sell or otherwise provide to third parties in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation; and (x) to sell or otherwise provide to third parties in the event of a future merge or acquisition by another company. In the event We merge or are acquired by another company, the successor company will have access to Your Personal Information in order to continue to provide services, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described in the subsection labeled "Changes to this Privacy Policy" below. 

HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We offer secure Web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and We store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on Our system. Although no computer system is completely secure, We believe the measures implemented on Our Website reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. 

HOW LONG WE KEEP USER INFORMATION 

We generally keep user data on Our server or in Our archives for as long as We reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, We may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. 

Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within Our direct control. Please note that We have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, Our general data retention policy applies.
