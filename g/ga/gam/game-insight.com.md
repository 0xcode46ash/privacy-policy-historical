# Privacy Policy

The security of your personal information is important to us. Please do not enter any personal information about yourself except the information needed to create and maintain your user account on social networks or App store websites. We do not hold any liability for any personal data or any sensitive information you provided during opening of the account, which is not expressly and specifically required for a proper registration.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while our goal to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee it is absolutely secure. Please keep it in mind before submitting any information about yourself. Please note that information that you voluntarily make public in your user profile, or which you disclose by posting comments will be publicly available and viewable by others. We do not hold any liability for any information that you voluntarily choose to be public through such and/or other explicit actions.

**We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. In addition, if you have not reached the age of majority in your state/province/territory/country of residence, you must obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not have this consent, or if you are under 13 years old, do not provide any personal information to us.**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way, including via any third party site or service, or via any cookies placed on your device by such third party site, through which you authorize us to access your information (e.g. Facebook, Google).  The types of personal information collected in this fashion may include your name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, and any other information necessary for us to provide or optimize our Services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about CMC’s products and services, including specials and new features. 

We may share some of the information we collect from you upon use of our Service with third parties service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Services we provide to you and/or for analytics purposes which may require the reproduction and display of such information.

You may "opt out" of the collection of your information for third party analytics purposes by sending “opt out” request either to  support@game-insight.com or to each particular provider as follows: <http://optout.devtodev.com/> (third party analytics service <https://www.devtodev.com/>) and/or by following the directions provided by our other third party analytics provider located at <http://www.mobileapptracking.com/privacy-policy/>, <http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html>, <https://help.chartboost.com/legal/privacy>, <https://developer.partytrack.it/privacy_policy>, <http://privacy.adcolony.com/>, <http://info.tapjoy.com/about-tapjoy/privacy-policy/?lang=ru>, <http://sponsorpay.com/>. If you “opt out” with our third party analytics providers, that action is specific to the information we collect specifically for that provider, and does not limit our ability to collect information from you, under the terms of this privacy policy, for other third parties. 

Personal Information Collected Automatically:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with or use our Service. CMC may automatically receive and record information on our server logs including, your IP address, unique mobile device identifier (UDID), International Mobile Equipment ID (IMEI), Android ID, device MAC address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, applications downloaded, and the actions and path you take on the Service.

Generally, the Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Service and how they use the various components of the Service. CMC only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users actually use parts of the Service so that we can make them appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those Services.  As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Services.  We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal user experience. Again, CMC never discloses information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

You need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and personal information by limiting access to your computer (or other device) and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

CMC endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, CMC cannot guarantee the security of user information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

Your information with limited access rights (including personal information) can only be accessed by our authorized employees or consultants or the concerned group entities, third party service providers, that need to have access to this data in order to be able to fulfill their given duties. However, we shall take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by any law and also when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with judicial proceedings, court orders, or legal process.

We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfill any of the services we provide or (2) comply with applicable legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from competent courts.

If we do decide to change our privacy policy, we will post any changes to this privacy statement so that you are all aware of what information we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances, if any, we may disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it relatively frequently. If we make any changes to this policy, we will notify you here.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, or if you would like to "opt out" of the collection of your information please contact us at: **support@game-insight.com**
