**Use of Cookies and Other Passive Information**

On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of Gametrailers.com involves cookies. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered on Gametrailers.com, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the site. Cookies help Gametrailers.com track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to Gametrailers.com. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of gametrailers.com. Some of our advertisers may occasionally set cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. Certain pages of Gametrailers may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page. Gametrailers may occasionally use web beacons in order to count users and to recognize registered users by accessing the Gametrailers cookies.

For example, we may collect your Web site browsing patterns or IP address to analyze the trends, help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer the Site.
