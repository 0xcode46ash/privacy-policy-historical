# Gamefly.com

  
GameFly knows that your privacy is important to you. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the personal information that you submit to us; please take a few moments to read it. By visiting GameFly.com, you are accepting the terms and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Why GameFly Collects Information  
All of the personal information we collect is used to make GameFly.com more enjoyable and more useful for our members. 

When you join GameFly, we ask you for certain personally identifying information, including your full name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and billing information (such as a credit card number). We use this personally identifying information to create your GameFly account, process your orders, and communicate with you about the status of your orders. 

We also use your e-mail address to send you GameFly newsletters. In addition, we may occasionally send special offers and promotional information to you via e-mail. If you wish to opt out of receiving such newsletters, special offers, and promotional information, log in to [Your Account ](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp)and change your E-mail Subscriptions. 

We will use your phone number only for customer service-related calls, never for sales or marketing purposes. 

Types of Information GameFly Collects  
There are several kinds of information we collect from visitors to our site. They include:

Information You Give Us  
When you first become a GameFly member, we ask you to give us your name, address, phone number, credit card number, and other personally identifying information so that we can process and ship your orders. We may also use this information for such purposes as answering your requests, communicating order information to you, and improving our service. 

Automatic Information   
Like many Web sites, GameFly.com sets “cookies” on your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser, allowing us to automatically identify you when you return to our site. They help us to match the games you’ve chosen to rent or buy with your individual account, and to personalize the GameFly.com Web site for you.   
If cookies are not enabled on your Web browser, you will not be able to use the GameFly.com site or the GameFly service. The “help” menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable cookies. 

Your order and billing history are also tracked automatically from the beginning of your GameFly membership. This allows you to log in to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) and see a complete list of games you’ve rented or bought from us. 

Security   
GameFly uses a secure server to encrypt all of your personal information. The secure server employs Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, the most advanced encryption method available today. 

To protect your information from unauthorized access or use, we use only the most advanced technology and security features for the GameFly.com site. We will continue to update and enhance our security practices as new technology becomes available. We have also implemented strict security guidelines for our employees, partners, and vendors. 

While we make every effort to ensure the security of your personal information, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, please be aware that when you submit information to us, you do so at your own risk. 

Sharing of Information   
Except as described below, GameFly does not sell, rent, or share your personally identifying information to third parties without:

1.) Notifying you of our intent to share such information, and   
2.) Giving you a chance to prevent your information from being shared. 

We use outside companies, agents, and contractors to perform some important GameFly tasks, such as processing credit card transactions and delivering your orders. In the course of doing so, these third parties can come into contact with some of your personally identifying information. However, we only give them access to the information they need in order to actually perform their tasks, and they are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy—that is, they must treat your personal information the same way we do. 

If we think that their products or services will interest our members, we may also partner with outside companies to send promotional announcements to some members. If you want to be excluded from these promotional mailings, you may opt out by logging in to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) and updating your E-mail Subscriptions. 

We may, at our discretion, provide our prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties with aggregate data about members and visitors to the GameFly.com site. However, such data is anonymous, and we do not disclose personally identifying information about specific users. 

GameFly reserves the right to disclose users’ personal information when required by law to do so. 

Updating Your Information   
To view or update your name, e-mail address, password, billing address, credit card number, e-mail subscription preferences, or other account information, log in to [Your Account.](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) There is a link to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) on most pages of the GameFly.com site. Please note that you must log in with your e-mail address and password before you can update any account information. 

If you believe that your account information contains errors, and you cannot correct those errors from the [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) page, please contact [ Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/help/contactus.asp). 

E-mail Privacy   
When you join GameFly, you are automatically subscribed to our newsletters, which may include special offers and promotional materials from GameFly or select GameFly partners. If you wish to opt out of receiving such offers and promotions, please log in to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/member/account.asp) and update your E-mail Subscriptions 

Under the GameFly referral program, you can help spread the word about GameFly by providing us with your friends’ names and e-mail addresses. In return, we provide your friends with free GameFly trial memberships. Names and e-mail addresses submitted to us for this program will be used only to send these free trial offers. GameFly does not share referral program names or e-mail addresses with any third parties. 

GameFly and Children   
Though the GameFly service is fun for all ages, you must be 18 years or older to create a GameFly account and become a member. If you are under 18, you may use GameFly.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

How You Can Safeguard Your Privacy   
While we’re always working hard to keep your personal information safe, you must play an important role as well. Take care to prevent unauthorized persons from learning any of your GameFly account information. 

If you choose to submit game reviews or postings to message boards or other public areas of the GameFly.com Web site, please be aware that these areas are, in fact, public. In other words, don’t submit personal or account information (such as your credit card number or password) in your posts. 

You are solely responsible for safeguarding your GameFly e-mail login and password. To prevent unauthorized use of your account, be sure to change your password often, and keep it in a safe place.
