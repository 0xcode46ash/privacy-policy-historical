# Gamestar Mechanic - Privacy Policy

Gamestar Mechanic (“Gamestar” or the "site") is an online service offered by E-Line Media (“we” or “us”) that allows users to play, design and share online games. This policy covers how we treat the information we collect and receive from you. Our goal is to create a safe, entertaining and educational online environment that complies with the United States Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 1, 2011. In the future, our site or our practices may change. When we make changes related to privacy, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect the changes. We'll post the updated version here, and we'll notify you if we think the changes will significantly impact the treatment of information you have already provided.

This Privacy Policy applies to the version of Gamestar Mechanic that is open to registration and use by members of the general public. We also make private “realms” of the service available to certain organizations or groups, and it is the responsibility of those organizations or groups to inform their users if their own privacy policies differ from this one. Users within these realms should contact their Realm Administrator for more information.

**Information we collect**

_Information you provide to us_

When you register for a Gamestar Mechanic account, we do not require that you provide us with any personal information such as a real name, address, email address or telephone number.

When you register, we ask for and store your birthdate in order to determine your eligibility to use certain age-restricted features of the site, specifically Social Media and Networking Features. We may also use your birthdate for the purpose of sending you a special gift on your birthday. Aside from these circumstances, we will not use your birthdate for any other purposes, including promotional purposes.

If you are thirteen (13) years old or older, you may also optionally provide us with an email address. If you choose to provide us with an email address, we will use it only to contact you to provide customer service. You also have the option of allowing us to use this email address to contact you regarding Gamestar Mechanic features, contests and promotions. If you are registering for a Premium Account or registering to use Gamestar Mechanic as an Educator, we require that you supply us with the email address of a person age eighteen or older. We will only use email addresses we collect for communication directly related to Gamestar Mechanic, and every email we send will have clear opt-out instructions. Furthermore, we will never share these email addresses with any third party.

If we do not have an email address on file for your user account (either because you are under the age of thirteen or have chosen not to provide us with one), you will also have the option of providing us with an email address in the event you initiate a support request. If you provide us with an email address in this situation, we will only use it to contact you with regard to your support request and will remove it from our system once the support request has been completed.

Gamestar Mechanic account holders can view the personal information they have provided to us any time they are logged into their account by going to their profile page. At any time, you may request that your personal information be removed from our system and your account be disabled, either from your profile page or by sending a request to [](https://web.archive.org/help/report). If you make such a request, we will disable your account and remove the personal information from our system so that it cannot be used in the future.

_Information we track_

When you visit the site and use different features of Gamestar, our automated software and tools routinely collect information for internal purposes, as described below, such as IP address, browser type and site usage (for example: what pages are accessed, how much time was spent on each page, etc…).

_Community Features_

As you use Gamestar Mechanic, you will have the option to participate in an online community with other users. Community features include

• Sharing games you have created with other users  
• Sharing an online profile with other users  
• Posting comments, reviews or ratings for your games or games shared by other users

All of these activities are optional, and our goal is to make them part of the safe, fun and educational Gamestar Mechanic experience. Your participation in these activities – as with all of Gamestar Mechanic – is governed by the Rules of Conduct, which describe the acceptable ways to use Gamestar.

We do not retain any personal information from you in the course of your using the Community Features. In fact, Gamestar’s Terms of Service and Rules of Conduct specifically prohibit users from sharing personal information through Community Features. We make every effort to enforce these rules through electronic tools, selective monitoring by our staff and investigating reports from our community members. You should understand, however, that any information you choose to share through Community Features may be accessible by anyone who uses Gamestar.

_Sharing Features_

In certain parts of the Gamestar, you may have the option of sharing something you’ve created or like using an “Invite a Friend” feature. In this case, you will be asked to submit your name and email address, as well as your friend’s name and email address. This information will be used only to send the message you requested, and will not be stored or maintained by us.

_Social Media and Networking Features_

In certain parts of Gamestar, you may have the option of sharing something you've created or like to a third-party social media or networking site such as Facebook or Twitter. We do not expose or allow access to these features to children under the age of 13 and, by default, these features are also disabled if your account is member of a school or institution (unless you are over 13 and your school or institution's administrator has enabled them). If you are over 13 and are not a member of any school or institution, you may also enable or disable access to social media and networking features for your account using the 'Manage Account' feature.

Your usage of these features is strictly voluntary. If you elect to use these features, you should be aware that your use of them is subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of the third-party social media or networking site, which may be different from those of Gamestar. In most cases, your use of such features will require that you log in to or authenticate with the third-party site.

Generally, we do not ask for or collect any personal information from you in order to use third-party social media or networking features. If, for any reason, the usage of a third party social media or networking feature requires that you provide personal information to us or would result in us having access to your personal information, you will be explicitly asked for permission (either by Gamestar, the third-party site or both) and given the opportunity to decline to provide the information and not use the feature.

_Paid Subscribers_

We require users subscribing to the Premium version Gamestar Mechanic to provide us with the information we need to process their payments such as name, address, telephone number and information about the method of payment. We securely store this information in our system for the purposes of automating future payments and providing customer service if authorized by the individual making the purchase (“Purchaser”). This information pertains to the Purchaser, who must be eighteen or older and who may or may not be the actual user of Gamestar Mechanic. Specific terms of use related to users of the Premium version of Gamestar Mechanic are described in the Subscriber Agreement.

_Cookies_

In common with many websites, Gamestar places small files known as “cookies” on our users’ machines. Cookies allow Gamestar to provide a convenient experience for our users by keeping track of user identities as they navigate to different parts of the Gamestar website. 

For the best user experience, we recommend that you configure your web browser to accept cookies from Gamestar Mechanic. It is possible to configure your web browser not to accept cookies, but this may cause some features of Gamestar not to work properly.

**How we use this information**

We use the information we collect to enable Gamestar features; respond to your requests and provide customer service; let you know about new features and other news from Gamestar; ask for your input and feedback on what we are doing; and provide personalized services and recommendations.

If you have provided us with an email address, we may contact you via email to share information that we think will be of interest to you such as new features, product updates and contests. If you would prefer not to receive these updates, you may opt out of them at any time by changing the notification settings on your account settings page. Each of these emails also contains instructions for how to opt out. However, even if you opt out of these notices, you will still receive email from us related specifically to your use of Gamestar: for example in response to a customer service request.

We also use your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally identifiable Gamestar website usage data to improve the quality and design of Gamestar and its website and to create new features, promotions, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.

_Third parties_

As part of our regular business conduct, we may securely share information with third-party companies or individuals providing services or acting on our behalf, such as companies providing payment processing, technological or fulfillment services.

Outside of these specific circumstances, we never share your personally identifiable information with third parties for any purpose. This includes not sharing your personal information with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes.

Occasionally, we may share non-personally identifiable data with third parties such as sponsors or academic researchers who are conducting research involving Gamestar Mechanic. In these circumstances, we only share data in ways that do not result in the third parties obtaining our users’ personal information.
