Our Services do not collect any Personal Data about Guests. However, our Third Party Services will still collect Personal Data. Generally, Guests have a similar browsing experience to Members, however, Members accrue loyalty benefits over time, such as, for example, the ability to disable Advertisements.

## 6.2. For Members

As a Member, you can decline to share Personal Data that is optional. This will not limit your experience of our Services. 

If you wish to no longer share mandatory Personal Data with our Services (Username and Email), you must end your Membership, at which point you will return to Guest status.

### 6.2.1. Deleting your Personal Data

This involves several steps:  


  1. Identify the Personal Data you have voluntarily provided across your posts and submissions.
  2. Erase this Personal Data you have identified that you provided voluntarily, by Editing affected posts and submissions.
  3. Use the [Scrubber](https://gamebanana.com/wikis/2019) tool in your Settings area.

  
Your Personal Data is stored centrally and securely in our Services' private, dedicated server cluster, located in the New York Metro Area of the United States. Your Personal Data is not transferred and stored outside this environment, nor is it stored with a distributed cloud-based hosting platform. Because we maintain our own private server infrastructure, we have full control over the security and replication of your Personal Data.

## 7.1. Data Replication

We replicate your Personal Data for backup purposes, in the event that our servers or hard disks fail, or in the event that through human error your Personal Data is deleted. Typically, we maintain 3 copies of your Personal Data on our Backup Server. Our Backup Server is located within our private server infrastructure as mentioned above, and is never transferred outside to a separate hosting environment.

## 7.2. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to provide Our Services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. To remove your Personal Data from public display on Our Services, please refer to _**Sharing Choices**_ above.

## 7.3. Data Security

Our Services implement administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:

  * Physical Barriers - our private server infrastructure is physically guarded 24/7.
  * Firewalls - our servers only communicate to one another in specific ways, between specific origins and destinations.
  * Network monitoring - we monitor for attacks on Our Services, and protect our Members' accounts by notifying them of suspicious activity.
  * TLS encryption - most of Our Services are only accessible via an encrypted connection.

  
However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure, and you understand that Machinefloor Co does not ensure or warrant the privacy or security of any information collected from or about you, and that when you use and share your Personal Data with Our Services you do so at your own risk. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. 

## 7.4. Personal Data Anonymization

If you choose to remove your Personal Data from public display, Our Services will still retain some of your Personal Data, _accessible by Administrators only_. Your Personal Data will become anonymized and used to inform our Security Platform. This anonymized Personal Data includes:  


  * Your IP Address
  * Your User agent

  
Personal Data Anonymization involves severing or scrambling the link between your Personal Data and you as a natural person. For example, when your Username (the primary form of Personal Data that identifies you on Our Services), is scrambled using the [Scrubber](https://gamebanana.com/wikis/2019), no person or system will be able to attribute your existing posts and submissions to you as a natural person.

## 7.5. Storage Maintenance

From time to time, our private servers require maintenance. Sometimes, they need to be re-purposed, turned off or migrated to other private servers within our private infrastructure. When this occurs, every effort is made to ensure your Personal Data is not exposed, lost, tampered with or abandoned.In order to maintain our Services, we must rely on Third Party Services. These include:

## 8.1. Advertising Networks

Advertising Networks may track you across the Internet in order to better target ads to you. When you search on Google for example, you may start seeing ads related to your search on our Services. This is called Remarketing. Advertising Networks use your IP Address to determine who you are and when to start and stop displaying certain ads to you.

## 8.2. Analytics Platforms

Analytics Platforms track your behavior on our Services anonymously. This data is used to inform us about how you use our Services and potential ways we can improve our Services.

## 8.3. Sharing Choices

To prevent your Personal Data being shared involuntarily with our Third Party Services, you have some options. Please note that these options cannot fully guarantee your Personal Data is not shared, but they will significantly reduce sharing that may occur. Warning, these options may significantly alter our Services' appearance and functionality.
