**Your Privacy Matters To Us**  


GameSpot Inc. collects personal information about our users during registration for the GameSpot service, during sign up for our newsletters, or through research studies delivered either on our web sites or via e-mail. Registration is required if a user wishes to enter a GameSpot contest or sweepstakes or submit a review of a game. 

The data we collect is used in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire GameSpot audience to improve the GameSpot service and help us sell the advertising that supports the sites. The personal information you provide lets us inform you about updates to the service and, if you have elected to receive such information, notify you of products and services of GameSpot Inc., its affiliates, and third parties we believe may be of interest to you. 

**Registration**  
GameSpot collects information from all registrants to our sites. Information collected during this registration process is used only in the aggregate to tell us your general gaming preferences and how you found out about our service, unless you also choose to receive promotional mailings from GameSpot and selected third parties, in which case the gaming preference information is used to help advertisers send e-mails only to those with specific gaming genre or hardware interests. 

GameSpot does let selected third parties use those e-mail addresses from users that specifically and actively consent to this use when registering to inform you of discounted or free products. GameSpot generally conducts such mailings on behalf of such third parties to ensure the proper use of such information. GameSpot permits a third party to use the information for limited purposes only after agreeing to comply with certain safeguards and other requirements. 

GameSpot respects your right to privacy. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from GameSpot or other parties to whom GameSpot may provide such information. You may also remove your e-mail address from our lists at any time. 

**Surveys and User Research**  
GameSpot also conducts periodic e-mail and Web-delivered surveys to gather information about our audience. We share the aggregate results of these surveys - not individual data -with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising on the service. 

GameSpot uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. 

You may correct your member information, join our mailing lists, or remove your name from any of the lists by going to http://www.gamespot.com/help/index.html. If you have questions we can be reached by e-mail at feedback@gamespot.com.
