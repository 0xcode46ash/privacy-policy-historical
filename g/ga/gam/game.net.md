We use the services of Cybersource to screen all orders prior to acceptance. Smart validation technology is used to help verify that the genuine cardholder is the person placing the order. This technology provides you with the comfort of knowing that if in the unlikely event that your card details were ever fraudulently obtained, Cybersource would immediately identify a different user profile or personal details based on your online order history and prevent the order form being accepted.

TrustUK is the body set up to approve online codes of practice. The Consumers Association and the Alliance for Electronic Business have worked together with support from the DTI in order to bring it about. The purpose of TrustUK is to set a standard for the conduct of e-commerce between business and consumers. The criteria for TrustUK approval covers all the concerns that a consumer might have when deciding whether to shop online.

The imrg Code sets out basic standards for e-retailing. It is a manifestation of the imrg members' collective effort towards establishing high industry standards that provides a meaningful point of reference and workable guidelines for e-commerce merchants and facilitators. The imrg Code is also the benchmark used by imrg and its members to facilitate self-regulation of the e-retail market: imrg reserves the right to measure the service of any e-retailer against the imrg Code, not just those who voluntarily comply with it, and to take appropriate action in order to protect the industry.
