### Introduction

GAME GROUP and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected about you. We have adopted a corporate-wide Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide online. All personal information relating to visitors, members, subscribers, Reward Card Holders or customers, using websites owned and operated by The GAME Group is held in accordance with The Data Protection Act 1998.

This privacy policy applies to the following web sites operated by The GAME Group:

  * game.uk.com 
  * game.net 
  * barrysworld.com 



In addition, The GAME Group owns several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or may not be listed above. Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by GAME Group or its subsidiaries, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organisations to which we link. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by The GAME Group online, not offline.

### Third Party Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the GAME-owned site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as The GAME Group. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a GAME site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.

### What personal information is collected?

### What happens to the information provided?

Members may register for other services from our site(s). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personal information), to that service provider.

Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play games on BarrysWorld.com, or participate in any of our other web sites.

We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular member. This information may be transmitted to an ad server owned by the advertising company to match members with ads that they are more likely to be interested in. However, we do not disclose any member's personal information to our advertisers without the member's consent. Participation in member surveys is entirely optional. We may share aggregate consumer data (which does not contain personal information) with the advertising companies.

Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs.

To enforce legal rights and the law, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, we may also disclose personal information to the appropriate civil or legal authorities.
