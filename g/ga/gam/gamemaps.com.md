# Privacy policy of GameMaps.com

The information gathered when you sign up for membership is used by GameMaps to get in contact with you. We will never share the information with a third party (some limitations apply which are described in our membership terms). The information can however be made public by your actions. For example when you post to the message board. 

We may choose to provide statistics from any material to either our advertisers, ad agency or visitors in general. BUT your personal information will not be displayed. Example: We may for example choose to display statistics regarding the percentage of our members which are subscribed to a specific mailing list. But we will NOT display all e-mail addresses subscribed. See the difference?
