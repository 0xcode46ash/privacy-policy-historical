## Fungo Media, Inc. Privacy Policy

The Fungo Media, Inc. Electronic Privacy Policy has been written to answer questions you might have about online privacy. As a company that develops technology for amateur sports teams we are very concerned about privacy and make an effort to safeguard any personal information we may collect about you or your children. This policy refers only to information collected by the GameChanger mobile application and displayed on the www.GameChanger.io website.

##### Our Commitment to Security

Fungo Media, Inc., has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial processes to safeguard the information we collect and prevent unauthorized access of information.

##### Advice to Children and Parents

We strongly advise children to get a parent or guardian's permission before submitting any kind of personal data over the Internet. We urge parents to be very clear with their children regarding the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) they don't know. We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites they visit.

If children under 18 elect to register for any Gamechanger services, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to our website. We will not request or knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from a child under 13.

##### What personal information do we collect?

All registered members of the www.GameChanger.io website are requested to provide an email address and password in return for access to the site.

In addition, team administrators (coaches, scorekeepers, volunteers) may input a limited amount of optional information about players on their amateur athletic teams. As of the writing of this document the following information is requested (but not required): first name, last name, position and preferred throwing and batting hand (left or right). For all youth teams (13 years and under) a full first and last name is never displayed online to anyone other than the team administrator(s) for that team.

##### How do we use this information?

GameChanger members who have agreed to receive emails from Fungo Media, Inc. may be contacted on a semi-regular basis with product updates or other marketing messages. Fungo Media, Inc does not share this contact information with any third party companies.

Fungo Media, Inc. uses the information team administrators provide to create live play-by-play and stats content for fans to view online. However, these team administrators can make personal player statistics private (ie, not visible to fans) at any time.

##### Cookies -- What are they?

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Internet surfing easier for you by saving your passwords and preferences while you're at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find that they are used by most major websites. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies can also help website developers see which areas are popular and which are not.
