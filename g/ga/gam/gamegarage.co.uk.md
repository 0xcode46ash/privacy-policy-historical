# GameGarage - Privacy Policy

Your IP address is saved for 15 minutes after you leave the site in the players online script, however the server saves all requests including the time and your IP address so that these logs can be used for statistics.

Another time at which information is saved is in the errors script, if you encounter an error your IP address is saved in the database so that these requests can be viewed to make sure people haven't been making hacking attempts to the system.

GameGarage uses cookies to store information about which games the user has rated to stop them from rating more than once an hour.

Also every time you visit a page on GameGarage it is logged as part of the page views system, but none of your details are taken in that. This is is the same for the number of plays today script.

The adverts shown on this site are mostly served by other companies which GameGarage doesn't control and so the advert content can't be controlled, and the information taken (if any) is not kept by GameGarage and so we aren't responsible for this.

The survey run on this site saves all the information entered, but doesn't save your ip address or any details which can be tracked back to you personally, unless you enter personal information in the comments or improvements boxes. It then sets a cookie on your computer to stop you from participating in the survey more than once a month.

If you want to [contact me](https://web.archive.org/contact/) about any of these policies or that data the site may have collected from you, feel free to do so.

This privacy policy is subject to change at any time.
