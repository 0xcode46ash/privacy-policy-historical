# Privacy Policy - GameGarage.co.uk

Your IP address is saved for minutes after you leave the site in the players online system, however the server saves all requests including the time and your IP address so that these logs can be used for statistics.

Another time at which information is saved is in the errors script, if you encounter an error your IP address is saved in the database so that these requests can be viewed to make sure people haven't been making hacking attempts to the system.

This site uses cookies to store information about which games the user has rated to stop them from rating more than once a day, and to stop people sending too many emails to friends.

The adverts shown on this site are mostly served by other companies which we don't control and so the advert content can't be controlled, and the information taken (if any) is not kept by us and so we aren't responsible for this.

The survey run on this site saves all the information entered, but doesn't save your IP address or any details which can be tracked back to you personally, unless you enter personal information in the comments or improvements boxes. It then sets a cookie on your computer to stop you from participating in the survey more than once a month.

If you signup to receive the newsletter your name and email address are saved in the database. These can be removed at any time by unsubscribing using the links at the bottom of each email, or by going to the [newsletter unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/unsubscribe.php) page and entering your email address. We don't pass any of your information to third parties so you won't get spammed.

If you want to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) about any of these policies or the data the site may have collected from you, feel free to do so.

This privacy policy is subject to change at any time.
