Your IP address is saved so that these logs can be used for our statistics package.

This site uses cookies to store information about which games the user has rated to stop them from rating more than once a day, and to stop people sending too many emails to friends. They are also used to remember your login information if you use the members system.

The adverts shown on this site are mostly served by other companies which we don't control and so the advert content can't be controlled, and the information taken (if any) is not kept by us and so we aren't responsible for this.

If you signup to receive the newsletter your name and email address are saved in the database. These can be removed at any time by unsubscribing using the links at the bottom of each email, or by going to the [newsletter unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/unsubscribe.php) page and entering your email address. We don't pass any of your information to third parties so you won't get spammed.

If you want to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) about any of these policies or the data the site may have collected from you, feel free to do so.

This privacy policy is subject to change at any time.
