# GameLink - Privacy Policy

|  | 

|  |  | 1\. NOTICE:   
---|---  
Game Link LLC (we) strictly maintains your privacy in all transactions. Your information is NEVER sold or shared with any third parties, except as disclosed in this statement. We never sell, give or lend mailing or ordering lists, including your data or any other part of them, except as needed to fulfill your order (e.g. shipping company, credit card processing company) or as requested by law enforcement (see below).

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Website for 30 days.   
  
|  | 3\. CHOICES:   
---|---  
As an individual, you have the opportunity to limit the personal information you provide.

There are non-mandatory sections of the forms we use that do not need to be filled out unless you want to include the information. Limiting the information you include could limit your access to certain special offers and promotions. 

You may choose not to register as a customer. This may limit your options for performing transactions on our site, and will prevent you from ordering online.   
  
|  | 5\. COOKIES:   
---|---  
We use cookies for several purposes. We use what are commonly called "session" cookies that only last as long as you are online. We use these cookies to identify your shopping cart and its contents and to help us personalize your service experience. These session cookies help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them. 

As part of the sign-in process, we may also use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies which stay with you and are on your computer, after your session is over and you are offline. We use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to remain partially logged in so that the next time you sign in, you will only need to provide your password. 

We sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology within the promotional emails that we send to our subscribers or advertisements for our service. The generated information is related to non-personally identifying customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels to gauge the effectiveness of advertisements and promotions. 

Additionally, GameLink uses a third party service provider: [WebSideStory, Inc.](http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/overview.html?lpos=Shortcuts&lid=Shortcuts+-+Our+Privacy+Policy) for internal use only, to help us track the activity and user flows within our service. This third party uses temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking. Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal analysis by GameLink to improve the website.   
  
|  | 6\. SECURITY:   
---|---  
Our secure servers and SSL protected ordering systems help assure the security of your private information at any point during your transactions with us. We take great precautions to protect any of your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

Though we are required to maintain your ordering history, it is kept discreet. We use the Verisign® system to ensure, as best they can, that email is kept encrypted and secure.   
  
|  | 7\. DATA INTEGRITY:   
---|---  
Game Link keeps the data you give us accurate, complete and current in order to speed your order to you. We only require personal data that will allow us to achieve this purpose and to maintain the "adult-only" nature of this Website.

Naturally, we can only maintain data that you submit. If you move or change your email address, please let us know so your records remain up to date and there is nothing to delay receipt of your order. We are not responsible for lost goods or services due to your failure to update your information.   
  
|  | 8\. ACCESS — YOUR OPTIONS TO CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION:   
---|---  
You are able to access and amend your personal information where it is inaccurate. This applies to the non-public records that we hold.

You can update and change your data by: 

  * · Logging in with your User Name and Password to access and edit your personal profile. This can be done while placing an order, or independently of placing an order at [https://www.gamelink.com/login.jhtml](https://www.gamelink.com/login.jhtml;jsessionid=UAtD8X7+VFJvkdEBNrld0A**.glstore-pbj2). 
  * Email Game Link Customer Service at [customerservice@gamelink.com](mailto:customerservice@gamelink.com) with a request to change information in your profile. 
  * Mail a letter requesting the change of information to:  
     Game Link Customer Service  
     537 Stevenson St. #100  
     San Francisco, CA 94103  

  * Fax an information change request to 1.208.460.3429.

You are the only person who can access and/or change your personal information. Keep your information secure by guarding the privacy of your username and password.   
|  | 9\. ENFORCEMENT:   
---|---  
We provide the following readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms by which any complaints and disputes regarding our privacy policy can be resolved: 

  * Please contact the Customer Service Department in writing or by email to [customerservice@gamelink.com](mailto:customerservice@gamelink.com).

Again: we keep all our ordering information, databases, email addresses, and mailing lists on our own secure servers. We feel obliged to remedy any problems that our customers may have regarding our privacy policy.

We understand that if we fail to comply with the principles outlined and annotated in this, our privacy policy, you, the customer, may not come back. We thus make every effort to comply. Your return business is our goal so our own sanction for ensuring compliance is the potential reduction in our business.

To ensure compliance by us we will, if contacted, cooperate with data protection authorities located in the European Community.  
  
|  | 11\. COREMETRICS:   
---|---  
We respect your privacy. We recognize that you may prefer to limit or eliminate the data that our service provider, Coremetrics, collects about your use of our Site. We invite you to indicate your preference by choosing an option below. No matter which option you choose, we will not provide Coremetrics with your name, phone number, email address or credit card information. We just assign a random number to your usage so that Coremetrics can identify a unique user of our Site. However, Coremetrics cannot associate that number with your personally identifiable information. The "Anonymous Visitor" option below simply eliminates this number.

Please note that because your status is maintained by placement of an "opt-out cookie" on your computer, your status will not be recognized if you visit our site from a different computer than the one you are using now to opt-out. In addition, if this cookie is removed or deleted, e.g., if you upgrade your browser to a new version or if you choose to clear out all your cookies, you will need to use this form again to opt-out and receive a new "opt-out cookie".
