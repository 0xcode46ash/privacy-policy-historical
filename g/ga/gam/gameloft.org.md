**IV. COLLECTION AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We, at Gameloft, recognize a special obligation to protect personal  
information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to the Gameloft forum by children 13 years of age or under. In order for children 13 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in forum activities that require registration, we require prior written permission or other verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. In other jurisdictions, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required from a parent or guardian for children under 14 or 18 years of age. Upon registration, the appropriate permission form will be made available. This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Gameloft by fax or mail to the Privacy Policy Administrator detailed in the Parental Consent Form instructions. Children 13 and under may not participate on certain portions of our sites. In some cases, we may not permit children under 14 or 18 years of age to participate in certain portions of our sites.

**V. SAFEGUARDS**

Gameloft maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under 13. Personal information collected by Gameloft is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.
