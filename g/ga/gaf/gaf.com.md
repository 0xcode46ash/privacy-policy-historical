# GAF | Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome to the website (the “Site”) of Building Materials Corporation of America, doing business as GAF (“GAF” or “we/our/us”). 

This privacy policy describes how GAF treats your use of the Site, including the handling of personal information.  We reserve the right to revise this privacy policy at any time without any further notice to you.  You should periodically read this policy to learn of any revisions. Your use of the Site at any time is deemed to constitute your agreement to all of the terms of this privacy policy then in effect. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Site. 

**1.   INFORMATION COLLECTION**

We may share both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (Non-PII) with third parties that help manage the Site and related databases, as well as with our parent company, partners, affiliates, and other third parties. 

**A.   Non-Personally Identifiable Information **

GAF gathers certain broad Non-PII about Site use, including the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the programs and services preferred. We look at the data in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. We gather this information so we can, for example, learn how many people visit the Site, see which pages are the most and least viewed, and identify which web sites are referring visitors to the Site and related information. The data helps us determine the extent to which visitors use certain parts of the Site and tailor the Site in the future. In connection with these activities we may use some of the following tools. 

Cookies and Pixel Tags: We use standard technologies such as a “cookie” and pixel tags to collect information about how the Site is used. A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer.  We use cookies to, among other things, identify your computer during a particular visit to the Site and analyze Site visitor behavior. If you create a user account or otherwise join our Site, these cookies enable you to store your password for fast log on and other conveniences. We do not store personal or sensitive information in cookies. Most Web browsers provide you with the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to take advantage of all aspects of our site.  Pixel tags, also known as beacons or clear GIFs, help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on Web pages. 

IP Addresses: We collect and analyze traffic on the Site by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. An IP address is the unique numeric identifier assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message. 

**B.   Personally Identifiable Information**

Certain areas of the Site require you to provide personal information.  The PII we collect may include your name, address, phone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address, fax number, a user name you provide, or similar information.  By submitting personal information to us, you agree that we may use the information in accordance with this privacy policy. 

If you do submit personally identifiable information to us, we may share such information with third party marketing partners in addition to using that information for the purposes for which it was submitted. 

We may also use your information in other ways, such as to contact you about changes to Site, to provide you with information about products and offers we believe will be of interest to you, or as otherwise disclosed to you at the point of collection.  We may share your information with affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, and any other organizations or entities for similar purposes. Additionally, to the extent required by applicable federal or state law, we will provide this information to others. 

By submitting information to us, you give us permission to receive it, review it, edit it, store it, and use it in appropriate settings designed to illustrate the viewpoint of GAF. 

**C.   Sharing Information for Operation Of GAF Business**

For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between GAF and our service providers who use that information only to conduct GAF business. For example, they may handle GAF’s credit card processing, shipping, data management, e-mail distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share your information to administer a Site feature. We provide our service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to protect your information.  The information that you submit on the Site may be provided to those vendors so that those vendors can provide services on our behalf. 

In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information we receive and that you give us online with other information from GAF sources, transactions and communications. This may include data from the Site, GAF contractors, direct mail, events, or online marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. 

We also reserve the right to share PII you provide with legal authorities if it is, in our sole opinion, necessary to investigate, prevent, or otherwise take action regarding suspected fraud, situations involving threats or potential harm, or if otherwise required by law (such as by a subpoena, court order, or other legal means). In the event that we reasonably believe that you have violated any of the Terms or policies governing your use of the Site, we reserve the right to use any information we have collected about you in connection with any efforts we make or made by any of our agents on our behalf. 

We may transfer personally identifiable information to an affiliate or third party as part of a transfer of business assets. Such a transfer would be within the scope of this policy so long as the affiliate or third party agrees to continue to maintain use and storage of PII in accordance with this policy. 

**2.   SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, PROMOTIONS**  
From time to time, we may request information from you via online polls, surveys, sweepstakes, or contests. Participation in these survey, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose information required to enter. Information requested may include personal contact information such as your name, address, phone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address, username, and/or similar information.  In addition, as noted above, we may share this information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, and any other organizations or entities. 

**3.   ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS**  
We work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect Non-PII about your visits to our Site and your interaction with our communications, including advertising. Our advertising partners may use cookies and pixel tags on this Site and on third party sites on which our ads appear, which allow the advertising partner to track certain information about user behavior, such as “click stream data.”  Any use of information by an advertising partner would be governed by their terms of use and privacy policy, so be sure to become familiar with these policies prior to responding to online advertisements.

  **4.   E-MAIL NEWSLETTER AND UPDATES, TEXT MESSAGES**  
If you sign up to receive an e-mail newsletter, e-mail updates, or text messages from us, we may collect, store, and use your e-mail address and mobile phone number to send you such information from GAF. We may also collect and store other PII including but not limited to your name, address, phone number, number, username, and/or similar information you may opt to provide us. In addition, as noted above, we may share this information with affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, and any other organizations or entities. 

**5.   OTHER COMMUNICATIONS / OTHER USERS **   
You may choose to contact GAF, by e-mail or otherwise, with other inquiries or to provide comments. Any PII you provide in connection with such inquiries or comments will be collected and used by GAF for the purpose of processing and responding to your inquiries or comments. 

**6.   FACEBOOK AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES**  
GAF maintains an active presence on several social networks.  Please read the privacy policies of those social platforms, because your participation at those sites will not be governed by GAF’s Privacy Policy. 

**7.   SECURITY**  
Information submitted via the Internet, including through a web page or e-mail is subject to interception or incorrect routing, and the Internet is not a fully secure communications channel. Please consider this prior to submitting any information to us via this Site.  While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**8.   INTERNATIONAL USERS**  
This site is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States. By using this Site, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States, and allow GAF to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**9.   UNSUBSCRIBE / CONTACT US **   
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from GAF or would like to update or change your personal information or preferences, follow the instructions below. However, GAF may send you service-related announcements, and transactional e-mail such as confirmations and receipts, from time to time through the general operation of the Site or by e-mail.  If you do not want to receive any e-mail from us in the future, click the “unsubscribe” reference in any e-mail we send you.  If you wish to review the contact information we have on file for you, correct your contact information, provide a change of address, or inform us how you wish your contact information to be used, please contact our staff.
