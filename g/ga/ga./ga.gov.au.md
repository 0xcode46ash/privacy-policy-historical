## Privacy

### General

This statement applies to user interactions with Geoscience Australia Website at: [http://www.ga.gov.au](http://www.ga.gov.au/)

### Data Collection and Click-Stream Data

Browsing any web-site, including the Geoscience Australia site, generates a trail of the pages that are visited, and the time apparently spent displaying each page. Clickstreams are the paths a user takes when navigating a web site and the internet in general. 

When you visit our site, our servers may record the following information for statistical purposes: 

  * the user's server (IP) address and machine name;
  * the date and time of visit to the site;
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded;
  * the number of bytes transmitted and received for each request;
  * the address of the referring page visited;
  * search terms used; and
  * the type of browser used.



Geoscience Australia examines this information to determine the traffic through the server, and to specific pages or applications, and in order to deliver better services. 

No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect server logs. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Geoscience Australia uses only session ID cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies can be easily blocked on your computer by simply un-checking the "accept cookies" option in your web browser. This can be found under the options menu of your Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer browser software. 

### Use and Protection

We will only record your email address if you send us a message, or if you subscribe to an e-mail list. Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which you provided it. We will not use your email address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent. 

Any personal details submitted via the Geoscience Australia website will only be used for the purpose for which they are provided. We will not use your personal details for any other purpose, and will not disclose them, without your consent. 

Information given during the course of online purchases and product orders may be used to determine your liability to Australian GST on the items purchased or ordered. 

If you have concerns about sending information over the web, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact_us.jsp) for alternative methods of submitting information (mail, fax etc). 

### User Feedback

We seek feedback from our users in order to improve the service offered by our site. [Your feedback is welcome](https://web.archive.org/about/contact_us.jsp). 

### Accountability

The staff who operate the Geoscience Australia Website, and most Australian government agencies, are subject to the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988

## Security

### Site security

|  The Internet is not a secure network, and as such, information you send may be intercepted by others. Geoscience Australia runs a secure website (using [SSL](http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6156-10/contents.htm)) for transferring all sensitive information such as personal and credit card details. Secure server technology reduces but **does not eliminate** the risks of sending information over the Internet. 

If you are sending us private information you should check that you are linked to our secure server. You can do this in two ways: 

  1. Check that the web address in your browser starts with **https** rather than just **http** ( _this page would be https://www.ga.gov.au/privacy.jsp_ ).
  2. If you can't find the web address, then most web browsers will display a padlock , usually at the bottom of the page. If the site is insecure some browsers may show an open padlock .



You should check your browser's help facility for further information on security. 

If you wish to switch to the **secure** website you can change by simply changing the **http:** // to **https:** // in your web address, or visit <https://www.ga.gov.au/>.

### Firewall security

Information you send us is stored behind our firewall. 

Any of your information, ( _apart from usage logs_ ), that is on our server outside the firewall is always **encrypted** , and moved inside the firewall at the earliest opportunity. 

Our **Online Ordering System** uses the Secure Sockets Layer for encrypted communication between your browser and our server and is [fully explained in a separate area](https://www.ga.gov.au/secure/order_security.html). Credit card details are **NOT** stored on our server. Each encrypted order is immediately transferred to our sales staff for offline processing. See also [online ordering](https://web.archive.org/sales/howto/index.jsp#forms) for more information. 

If you have concerns about sending information over the web, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact_us.jsp) for alternative methods of submitting information (mail, fax etc).
