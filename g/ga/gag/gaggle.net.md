### Background

Gaggle has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy, and in particular our pledge to ensure the safety of our student users. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Gaggle web site.

In general Gaggle automatically gathers usage information like frequency of users to certain areas, number of log-ins, number of email messages sent and received, etc. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps Gaggle determine how often certain areas of the site are being visited so we can improve the site to make it as user friendly as possible.

We use your assigned access level to deliver content specific to your interests or position.

Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information such as their name and email address. We use this contact information from the registration form to verify your status as a teacher or school district employee and your affiliation with a particular school, district, or educational institution. This is done to protect the safety of our users. We at Gaggle want to provide safe, controlled email accounts for students and teachers. The customer’s registration information is also used to contact the user with information about our company and updates to the Gaggle Email Service.

### Disclosure

We do not disclose personal information such as your name, address, email address or telephone numbers to any outside companies. But, as mentioned above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated information regarding the overall use of Gaggle.

### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. Users should be aware, however, that Gaggle cannot guarantee security and confidentiality. Users should also be aware that the use of Gaggle Email is not private. While Gaggle does not routinely monitor message content, it may be necessary to back up or review messages to identify network problems or if a user has violated the terms of service. Gaggle, at its’ discretion, may choose to turn over or make available message content to appropriate personnel or law enforcement agencies if required.

### Student Safety

Gaggle supports the efforts of COPPA to ensure the online safety of children. Email accounts on Gaggle are provided only through a qualified school or educational organization. Schools receive a master account which enables them to create accounts for student users. Schools should obtain parental permission before issuing accounts to students.

Gaggle will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without consent of either a parent/guardian or a qualified educational institution except in cases of Possible Student Situations (PSS), which are reported to law enforcement.
