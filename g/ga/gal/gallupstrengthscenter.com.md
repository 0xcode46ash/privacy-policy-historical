# Privacy Statement

Protection of personal privacy has always been a hallmark of Gallup. Since its inception in 1935, Gallup has maintained the anonymity of each survey respondent unless an individual user consents to the release of the user's Personal Information or individual results. In a like manner, Gallup protects the identity of individuals who access Gallup Websites. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the terms "Gallup, we, us, and our" refer to Gallup, Inc., 901 F Street, NW, Washington, D.C., 20004, U.S.A. For questions about this Privacy Statement or your Personal Information, please contact [privacy_administrator@gallup.com](mailto:privacy_administrator@gallup.com).

This statement describes the types of information, including Personal Information, collected and processed through Gallup websites and through the services delivered via Gallup websites, and how Gallup treats such information.

**_Personal Information_**

By using the term " **Personal Information** " in our Privacy Statement, we refer to information that you individually provide to Gallup either directly or indirectly that on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you. Personal Information includes your name, your mailing address, your telephone number, and your e-mail-address, and may include other information that identifies you.  
Information that by itself cannot be used to identify you does not qualify as Personal Information. This includes but is not limited to your age, your gender, or other preferences.  


**I. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY GALLUP WEBSITES**

Gallup websites gather information in two ways: (1) indirectly (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) directly (for example, when you, the site visitor, voluntarily provide information on various pages).

**_1\. Information Collected Indirectly_**

Gallup indirectly collects a variety of information pertaining to use of our websites.

**_1.1. Tracking Data  
_** Website traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given website or page on a daily basis is typically referred to as **Tracking Data**. This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit any Gallup Websites, our servers log your computer's IP address.

To obtain these Tracking Data, Gallup uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze how users use the Gallup websites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Gallup websites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. On behalf of us, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Gallup websites, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Gallup Websites.

You can prevent Google's collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en> . In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, is the full IP address sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.

Further information can be found under <http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html> (Google Analytics Terms of Service & Privacy).

Only designated administrators of Gallup can access the information gathered by Google Analytics, and the information is only used for administrative and planning purposes to meet the needs of our users, such as to improve the content of the site and to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users.

_**1.2. Gallup Cookies**_  
Other types of indirectly collected information are stored in "cookies". Cookies are small files of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help that visitor while on the site. Some Gallup websites use cookies simply to store a user code so that the user does not have to re-enter their information when re-joining the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept them is yours. Adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. Even without accepting a cookie, users can still access most of the features offered by Gallup websites. Cookies placed by Gallup will expire when the user terminates the website session or after a reasonable period of inactivity.

  
**_1.3. Third-Party Cookies_**  
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness.
