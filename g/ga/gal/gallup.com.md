# The Gallup Organization - Privacy Policy

| Â  |  **The Gallup Organization - Privacy Policy**  


Protection of personal privacy has always been a hallmark of The Gallup Organization. Since our inception in 1935, Gallup has maintained the anonymity of survey respondents unless the respondent provides express consent to the release of individual responses or information. In a like manner, we protect the identity of registered users of the _Gallup Tuesday Briefing_ publication as well as the identity of individuals who access our website. 

_**Information Collected by Gallup**_   
Gallup collects two types of information from registered users: personal data, such as name, address, and e-mail address; and aggregated data, such as information about traffic patterns on Gallup.com (for example, how many users log on to Gallup.com on a daily basis). 

_**Personal Data**_   
Personal data is collected during registration for the _Gallup Tuesday Briefing_ publication. **Gallup will never disclose your identity or personal information to any third party**. Gallup will never barter, trade, or sell access to our database of registered users. 

Personal data is collected during registration for the Gallup News _Alerts_ service. We have chosen Alerts.com, to be the distributor of our News _Alerts_ service and the personal information collected for this service will reside on their server. **Under no circumstances will Gallup disclose your identity or personal information to Alerts.com.** Further, Alerts.com will not have any rights to access or barter, trade or sell, your personal information. 

_**Aggregated Information**_   
Gallup gathers aggregated information for both registered and non-registered users. Aggregated information (such as which pages users visit) is collected through various means. One of these ways is through an IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from Gallup, our servers log your IP address. **Gallup does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, your session will remain anonymous to us.** Gallup collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration. 

_**Use of Cookies**_   
A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes when you visit them. Gallup does not use "cookies" to collect information.

_**Use of Information Collected by Gallup**_   
Gallup uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for individuals or groups of users, and if requested, to provide information services by e-mail to the user. Gallup reserves the right to change the policy on use of information collected. Any changes in policy will be noted in a revised privacy policy statement and will be posted at least 30 days prior to implementation. 

_**Correcting and Changing User Information and Preferences**_   
If you have registered as a member through our online registration system and have subscribed to one or more of our e-mail newsletters and do not want to receive such e-mail newsletter(s) from us in the future, discontinue your subscriptions by e-mailing us at [tuesdaybriefing@gallup.com](mailto:tuesdaybriefing@gallup.com). 

_**Information Security at Gallup**_   
Gallup employees understand the need for user privacy and the company has appointed a Privacy Policy Administrator to monitor privacy practices. Access to user data is strictly limited and can only be accessed by specific individuals who have the necessary user name and password combination. A log is maintained to record who has accessed the data. This log is monitored periodically for security breaches. 

_**Children and Privacy**_   
Gallup encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. Gallup's sites will not contain content that is considered unsuitable for children. 

_**Links to Other Sites**_   
It is important to note that the Gallup site may contain links to other sites, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Gallup. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect data and make use of it in ways that Gallup does not.
