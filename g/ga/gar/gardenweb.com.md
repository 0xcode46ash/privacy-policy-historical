Privacy Policy for The Virtual Mirror, Inc.   


* * *

This policy covers all sites owned and/or operated by The Virtual Mirror, Inc., including:

* * *

Email Lists

>   * All email lists are "opt in", meaning users must explicitly subscribe themselves. No email addresses are added through any other means. 
>   * Email lists are not sold or shared with any other companies or entities. 
>   * Users may unsubscribe at any time. 
> 


* * *

Forums

>   * Information provided by users in forum messages, though publicly available, is not recorded anywhere at our site except in the actual forum message. Nor is this information shared with any other companies or entities. 
>   * Once they have posted a message, users names and email addresses may be recorded in "cookies" that reside on users' own computers. This is solely to facilitate posting to the forums and this information is not available to any other site. Registered members may choose to keep their email address hidden from other users. 
>   * The IP address of a user is recorded with the forum message as a matter of record. Users should not consider postings to our forums as being anonymous. 
> 


* * *

Tracking

>   * Information on usage patterns is collected in ways that do not involve users' personal information. 
>   * Use is made of anonymous, numeric "cookies" in evaluating usage patterns. 
>

Cookies

> Cookies are used to track general usage patterns and to make the forums easier to use. For instance, after you have posted a message, your name and email address will be "remembered" in a cookie so the next time you post, you won't have to enter this information again. We could save this information in a central file on our server, but in the interest of privacy, we save it to a cookie, which resides on _your_ computer. Cookies are also necessary for members to log in. Cookies are used both by ourselves and the various ad networks with which we are associated (see: Third Parties.) 
> 
> There are many misconceptions about cookies. Here are some facts: 
> 
>   * The cookie is assigned by the Web site. It can only contain information known to that site. 
>   * When a Web site reads a cookie, it can only read the information that the Web site itself had assigned to the cookie earlier. 
>   * Only the site assigning a cookie can read it later. 
>   * Drinking milk with your cookies will make them go down easier.

> Some of our sites, including gardenweb.com, thathomesite.com and nature.net, work with third parties that serve ads to these sites. Our third-party advertising companies also separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Disclosures

> The Virtual Mirror, Inc., may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) The Virtual Mirror, Inc.'s rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. The Virtual Mirror, Inc., may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
