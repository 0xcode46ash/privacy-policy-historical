At Garnet Hill, we are concerned about privacy issues and have therefore established a policy that respects the privacy and security of your personal information. Garnet Hill recognizes that we must preserve and use customer information responsibly. We always welcome any feedback and questions. For privacy related issues you can contact us:

**Information we collect and how we use it**  
Garnet Hill, selling under the brand names Garnet Hill and Growing Up with Garnet Hill, collects customer information under the following conditions:

  * an order is placed from our catalogs or web site  

  * an inquiry is made about our products or services  

  * a catalog is requested  

  * a gift package is received  

  * a registration is completed on our web site  

  * a purchase is made at our retail outlet stores  

  * a customer subscribes to our emails



The information, collected and maintained in a secure database, may include name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and when necessary, payment information. Garnet Hill may use this information to send you electronic (via email) or printed (via US mail) materials promoting our products, announcing sales, and offering other special, limited-time discounts. Every customer has the option of declining to receive future promotions from Garnet Hill by contacting Customer Service. Email customers can opt out of additional emails from Garnet Hill by unsubscribing on the link that appears on the bottom of every email, or by contacting Customer Service.

Garnet Hill and Growing Up with Garnet Hill occasionally make customers' names and postal addresses available to other carefully selected and screened companies for the purpose of sending our customers relevant and complementary catalog, magazine, and fundraising offers. Individual information shared may consist of name, address and aggregated data including range of dollars spent, date range of transactions, and category of items purchased. We do not share customer telephone numbers, email addresses, or payment information with other companies. You always have the right to choose not to receive information from us or from other companies by simply contacting us by any of the methods noted above.

Garnet Hill also gathers information from our web site using cookies and pixel tags. Cookies are small pieces of electronic information or data files that are stored by the web browser on the hard drive of a customer's computer. They allow us to retain visitor preferences, registration information, and remember shopping cart selections. Cookies can also be used to collect anonymous data that, when aggregated, allows us to improve the content of the Garnet Hill site, customize and personalize the site presentation for visitors, and generally enhance our customers' shopping experience. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that are placed on the web site or in an email to help us identify what parts of the web site customers visit, measure the effectiveness of searches, allow us to send you emails in the most readable format, and identify if emails have been opened by recipients. They also help us to summarize traffic volume, click paths, and browser usage on our site. This information is used to make sure that our marketing efforts are effective and that our site provides our customer with the most efficient and usable online experience.

Garnet Hill is a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and therefore follows the DMA privacy guidelines. For more information on these guidelines or to use the DMA's Mail Preference Service to reduce having your name distributed to other direct marketing companies, you can visit www.dmaconsumers.org.

**Security**  
Garnet Hill protects your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL digitally encrypts your order, making it undecipherable to anyone except Garnet Hill. To take advantage of secure shopping you must have an SSL compatible browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. Some browsers and some firewalls do not allow access to secure servers and will therefore limit your shopping experience.

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by Garnet Hill and Growing Up with Garnet Hill as indicated above unless you notify us otherwise. If we make a change to our policy, we will be sure to post those changes on this page so you can always be aware of the information we collect and how we use it.
