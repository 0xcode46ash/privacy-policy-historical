# Garmin: Garmin International's Privacy Statement

Garmin International respects your right to privacy and shares your concern about the security of any data you may submit to our website. The following statement discloses the guidelines we have established for protecting the information you provide to us during your visit to [http://www.garmin.com/](https://web.archive.org/). 

This website is owned, operated, and maintained by:   


Garmin International Inc.

What information about me do you collect and how is it used?   
Garmin only collects personal information about you if you voluntarily choose to share it with us. We do not rent or sell information concerning our customers to third parties.

When you visit garmin.com, unless you voluntarily disclose personal information, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information about you. However, we do collect and store certain data about the use of our website. This is done on an anonymous basis, and the same information is collected for all hits on our servers. The information collected may include the time and date you visited the site, the pages you looked at, and your IP address and domain name. We do not link this information to anything personally identifiable to you. We only use this information for system administration and to help us develop ideas about how we might tailor our site to improve your visit. This information is not rented or sold to third parties and will not be used by us to contact you in any way. 

When you visit shop.garmin.com, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that help us keep track of your shopping cart as you move through our store, and they only contain the necessary information to associate a shipping ID on your computer with the orders in the "shopping cart" table on our server. Please note: At the present time, you cannot purchase from shop.garmin.com with the "cookies" feature shut off on your browser. If you place an order at shop.garmin.com or you request an unlock code for a MapSource CD at the garmin.com MapSource unlock pages, we will request and collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, and expiration date. This information is used to fill your order or process your request for a MapSource unlock code, as the case may be.

On our garmin.com website, there are several opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself with us. This may include information about you such as your interests, your name, and your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is strictly voluntary. If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it for internal marketing research and other marketing purposes. We may, in the event that this information is collected as part of a warranty registration process, use this information to contact you later. If the information is sent as part of a website evaluation, we may also use the information to contact you about your comments. However, we do not rent or sell your information to another company. In the case of MapSource Unlock data, certain customer information is shared with our data providers. These providers currently use this information for internal demographic analysis. These providers may, in the future, use this information to inform you when new data is released or new products become available. They may also give this information to third parties without Garmin's knowledge. 

You may decide to send Garmin personally identifying information in an e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about our products or services. Garmin will use this information to identify you as a Garmin customer and to respond to the electronic mail. We will only use the information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. Garmin never sells e-mail addresses. 

We may transfer personal information that you share within the Garmin group of companies in order to provide the products that you request. Except as specified above, we will only share your personal information with third parties if: 

  * we have your consent; 
  * we consider that we are required to do so by law; 
  * we find that you are in breach of our terms and conditions or any of our policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services; 
  * it is necessary in our opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences or attacks on the technical integrity of our site(s) or our network; or 
  * it is necessary in our opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of Garmin or its employees, the users of our website(s), or the public. 



What does Garmin do to protect the data I transmit to your Online Store?   
Garmin's online store, shop.garmin.com, uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information such as your credit card number. Garmin uses [VeriSign](http://www.verisign.com/), an industry leader in online security and site verification, to ensure our site's security. Garmin's website shop.garmin.com is also registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm our identity before any personal information is sent. In addition, our secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology. 

What do you do after you get an order from me?   
Not only does Garmin protect your purchase-related information as it is transmitted to our servers, but we also secure the servers themselves to help prevent unauthorized access to the data after it is in our hands. We have comprehensive security measures in place to protect our Internet servers, as well as our internal corporate computer resources, from loss, misuse, and alteration. In addition, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. 

What can I do to help make sure online shopping works correctly?    
To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to make purchases at Garmin's online store. Please note: If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted. Garmin will not be responsible for any compromise of data that is intercepted due to the customer's use of an unsecured browser. 

Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid site identification information for the site you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. We recommend that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the site you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than the normal http://), along with the security symbol of your browser (an open or closed padlock in Netscape or a broken or complete key in Internet Explorer) to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the site to which you are connected. We encourage you to use this to check the validity of any site you connect to using secure communications. 

If my credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on my account, what should I do? If your credit card company determines that there are fraudulent charges on your account that are the result of your purchase at shop.garmin.com and they hold you liable for the unauthorized changes, please contact us immediately. You can contact us by e-mail at mailto:websales@garmin.com or postal mail: 

Garmin International Inc.   
1200 E. 151st St.   
Olathe, KS 66062   
Attn: Webmaster (credit card fraud) 

You should carefully review security/privacy policies of any third party sites accessible from our site. Other sites accessible through our website have their own policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's policies and practice. Garmin is not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. The information practices of those websites linked from our site are not covered by this Privacy/Security Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. 

Do you offer opt-out or opt-in services?   
There are no opt-in or opt-out selections on our website. Garmin does not have any mail lists or other systems in place that are traditionally associated with these service options. However, we may implement electronic newsletters or similar broadcast mail systems in the future. If we do, these services will only be offered on an opt-in basis. Currently, we do not mass e-mail or provide such information to outside mailing lists. 

What if information I have previously submitted has changed?    
If you need to change the information you have sent to us on a product registration, please e-mail [warranty@garmin.com.](mailto:warranty@garmin.com)

Is Garmin responsible for all of the material I see on your website?    
Garmin does maintain responsibility for and authority over all information contained on its website. However, we may post links to sites that we do not control. Garmin is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. 

What about testimonial copy?  
Testimonials submitted to stories@garmin.com may be used on the website and in promotional newsletters and other publications. If you submit communications—either written or electronic—to Garmin, please indicate if you do not want your submission published or if you would prefer us to use your initials rather than your full name. 

What's your policy regarding children's use of your website?    
While Garmin encourages everyone to visit our site and learn about our company and GPS technology and applications, we have no desire to collect information from those under the age of 18. Any instance of personal information about a minor being collected would be purely accidental and unintentional. If a minor would like to submit information to Garmin, we ask that the child's parent submit the information on his or her behalf. We strongly encourage parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to take appropriate steps to ensure a positive and safe experience. 

Where can I learn more about using the Internet and protecting my privacy?   
The United States Federal Trade Commission has a web page <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html> devoted to providing you with information about protecting your privacy online. Garmin encourages you to familiarize yourself with the concepts discussed on this page. For more information, you may also wish to review _[Site Seeing on the Internet](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html)_[.](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html) This handbook contains useful information regarding how to use the Internet wisely. 

Privacy/Security Policy changes **  
** This Privacy/Security Policy was last changed on January 10, 2003. If Garmin makes changes to any terms or conditions of this Privacy/Security Policy, these changes will be posted on our websites in a timely manner. 

Disclaimer: While we continue to work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure and Garmin cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.
