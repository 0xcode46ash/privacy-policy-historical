  * Gardenista also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Gardenista believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Member Agreement, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Gardenista, our users or others.
