During registration and account setup, we ask you to submit information such as your name, email address, zip code, brokerage names and account descriptions, and the type of operating system your computer uses. Also during registration, we may ask you to share other personal information that is optional, such as your gender, birthdate, referral names and email addresses. This information is **optional** and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. This information will only be used internally by GainsKeeper's marketing department for demographic studies on our users and their investing and tax filing practices in order to generate statistics on our user base. However, we do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable or Optional Information to a third party without your consent or request. 

ShareBuilder provides access to the GainsKeeper services for ShareBuilder Advantage and other customers that subscribe or pay for the service through ShareBuilder. All access is made solely via the ShareBuilder Web site. Upon registration, you will need to record and/or create personally identifiable information in the system. This information includes your First/Last name, email address and the securities you buy or sell, when you purchased the securities and for how much. Without this information, GainsKeeper would be unable to adjust your cost basis and generate Capital Gain/Loss reports for tax preparation and portfolio analysis. This information is necessary for GainsKeeper to provide its service, but GainsKeeper does not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party without your consent or request. This information may be shared with Sharebuilder for the following purposes: (i) Should ShareBuilder decide to migrate the Gain/Loss reporting functionality to its own systems (ii) Reconciliation for accounting purposes (iii), and Aggregate usage statistics.

If you wish to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from GainsKeeper's systems at any time, email this request to [billing@gainskeeper.com](mailto:billing@gainskeeper.com).

GainsKeeper uses the information you enter to provide its tax lot accounting service, such as custom Capital Gain/Loss and Schedule D reports with the user name and address in the report header for proper tax filing. We also use personal information to do research on demographics, interests, and behavior. Our research is done to better understand and serve our users. For example, GainsKeeper uses investment information to determine what type of trading activity the majority of our users undertake. In general, if our users are trading more mutual funds than stocks we can target future development efforts on services focused on mutual fund analysis. A past study of this kind indicated that a large portion of our users required option functionality, and we made development plans accordingly to now offer this. This information and analysis is compiled only on an aggregated basis for general statistics. 

There are opportunities where individuals can opt-in to receive a premium service from GainsKeeper or its partners. Upon approval, certain information can be shared with ShareBuilder so that they can provide the requested service. An example of opt-in premium services are if GainsKeeper partners with a brokerage or an advisory company to provide a GainsKeeper members with services, such as automatic data downloads. GainsKeeper members will opt-in to elect this type of premium service before any personally identifiable information is shared.
