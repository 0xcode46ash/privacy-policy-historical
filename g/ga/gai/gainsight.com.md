# Privacy Policy | Gainsight

  * 


Gainsight, Inc. respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, business partners and others who may use our services. Not only do we strive to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business, but we also aim to uphold the highest ethical standards in our business practices. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles that Gainsight, Inc. follows with respect to transfers of personal information between the United States and member states of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (the European Economic Area).

#### Safe Harbor

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the “Safe Harbor Principles”) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Gainsight, Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.

#### Scope

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to all personal information received by Gainsight, Inc. in the United States in any format including electronic, paper or verbal.

#### Definitions

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply: “Gainsight, Inc.” will refer to its application service described at ([www.gainsight.com](http://www.gainsight.com/)). “Personal information” means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by Gainsight, Inc. or its agents to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. “Sensitive personal information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, Gainsight, Inc. will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

#### Adherence to European Union Safe Harbor Privacy Principles

Gainsight, Inc. complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  Gainsight, Inc. has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

Gainsight, Inc. may disclose Personal Data, including the data you submit to the Service, with or without notice (a) if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, (b) where required by law, or (c) at our sole discretion, where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of our User Agreement or the rights of Gainsight, Inc. or any third party.

#### Gainsight, Inc. and its Affiliates

Although Gainsight, Inc. currently operates as an independent corporation incorporated in the USA, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), it may in the future share some or all of your Personal Data with these affiliates, in which case it will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

#### Change of Ownership

In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Gainsight, Inc. User information, including Personal Data, to a separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on our website or an email to the email address you provide when you register) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Gainsight, Inc. assets by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of their registration information at that time.

#### SECURITY

Gainsight, Inc. uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by Gainsight, Inc. in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, Gainsight, Inc. cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “crackers” from obtaining this information.
