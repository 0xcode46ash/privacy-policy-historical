We recognise a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. 

Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.

### What are cookies and how do you use them?

Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to “remember” things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Gadget Guy™ may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

### What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol (“IP”) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). Gadget Guy™ may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

### What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact:
