We will only use personal information which we might collect when  
• we provide you with information about our products, services, and/or    special offers  
• you have authorised us to do so.  
• we have given you notification of the intended use and you have not    objected to that use.  
• we believe that the use is reasonably necessary to assist a law    enforcement agency or an agency responsible for national security in    the performance of their function.  
• Peter Blasina is authorised, required or permitted by law to disclose    the information.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
Any personal information you provide to Peter Blasina is strictly confidential. Peter Blasina will not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, license, share or pass that information on to any third parties, other than those who are:   
contracted to Peter Blasina to keep the information confidential; or   
bound by a privacy policy which imposes similar restrictions to Peter Blasina's privacy policy regarding the handling of personal information.   
We may disclose the personal information, other information or data we collect from you for the purposes specified to you at the time of collection or for another purpose if:   
you would reasonably expect us to disclose it for that purpose; and   
that purpose is related to the purpose specified to you at the time of collection.  
If we wish to disclose any of this personal information, information or data other than is set out above, we will not do so unless we have your express consent to do so. Exceptions to this include:   
where Peter Blasina suspects that unlawful activity is or has been engaged in and uses the personal information, information or data to investigate the suspected unlawful activity; or   
the use is authorised by law or reasonably necessary to enforce the law. These uses may include where Peter Blasina is required to provide information in response to subpoenas or warrants or other legal process including requests from regulatory authorities.   
Security of Your Information  
Peter Blasina will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment accessed only by authorised persons.

Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own system.

**How to Access and Update Your Personal Information**  
Our goal is to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You can always access your personal information and content that you provide to us by contacting us. We will update the relevant information. Exceptions to this include:   
where providing access will pose an unreasonable impact on the privacy of an individual;

where the information relates to existing legal proceedings between Peter Blasina and you and the information would not be discoverable in the process of those legal proceedings; or   
where providing access would be unlawful, may prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity, may prejudice enforcement of laws or denying access is specifically authorised by law.  
If Peter Blasina does not allow you to access your personal information, we will provide you with reasons for our decision. If you believe that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is inaccurate, incomplete or not up-to-date but Peter Blasina does not agree with you, we will post a statement of your claim where the information is kept and accessed.
