### [Privacy Policy](http://www.gadgetell.com/privacy/ "Permanent Link to Privacy Policy")

This privacy policy covers all Dabbledoo sites. Please read this statement before accessing Dabbledoo sites. By using Dabbledooâ€™s sites, you are agreeing to abide by the Terms of this statement.

**Comments**

Dabbledoo gives readers the option to leave comments on posts. In order to leave a comment, users must leave their name and a valid email address for spam-fighting purposes. In addition, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We will not pass on any of this information to any other organization.

**Mailing Lists**

Dabbledoo at times may choose to launch mailing lists for its sites. In order to sign up for these lists, users must submit their email addresses. The mailing lists contain recent articles from Dabbledoo network sites and may eventually contain advertisements. Your personal information will not be shared with any other organization.

**Third Party Cookies**

From time to time, our business partners (advertisers) may use cookies on Dabbledoo sites. Since they are not our cookies, Dabbledoo has no control over them once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. Therefore, this privacy policy covers only the use of cookies by Dabbledoo and does not cover the use by any of our advertisers.

**Stats and Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.

**Links**

The Dabbledoo sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Dabbledoo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Dabbledoo.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, you will be able to find the updated information on this page (http://www.dabbledoo.com/privacy).
