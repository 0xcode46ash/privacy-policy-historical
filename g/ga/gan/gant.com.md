# GANT - Privacy Policy

**GANT USA Privacy Policy:**

Gant USA Corporation (“Gant”) collects customer information to improve our customer's shopping experience and to correspond with our customers about our products, services and promotions. We collect information such as your name, e-mail and postal address and credit card numbers, that you present to us when you place an order, when you save your information with us or when you participate in a promotion or survey. Gant may use your information collected online to process and fulfill your order. In addition, we retain a record of your product interests, purchases and whatever else might enable us to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We also monitor site use and traffic patterns to enhance our web site design and the merchandise and services we offer. Gant recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online and in our stores. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with select partners and others. By combining this information we can improve our communication with you about our products, special events and promotional purposes and to personalize your shopping experience.

When setting up an online account at any of our websites, you will be prompted to select a password. The retrieval of personal information relating to you is only available to you if you provide the correct password that you have created, and all profile information, including your address book, is only available while you are logged in to your account.

Gant works with reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf. Sometimes these service providers require information about our customers in order to provide the best service to you, such as fulfill orders and promotions, maintain and manage our customer database and report on customer behavior and/or preferences.

When Gant gives these service providers access to your information, we require them to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and we do not allow them to use it in any way other than to enhance our service to you.

At times we will use the services of a few carefully selected companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. These companies help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and better understand how visitors use our sites. To do this, cookies are placed on computer browsers. The type of information collected in this manner includes pages visited, products viewed and products placed in your shopping cart. By supplementing our records, this information helps us to identify what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.

Gant is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13. We do not sell products for purchase by children and all children's products we sell are for purchase by adults only.

This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws. We will post a prominent notice on the site to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Notice and indicate at the top of the notice when it was updated.
