### 2\. IP Addresses and Cookies

We may also collect information about your computer and your visits to and use of our site, including, where available, your computer's IP address, geographical location, operating system, referral source, browser type, length of visit and number of page views. We will collect this information for the purposes of system administration, optimising the use of our site and reporting aggregate information to third party suppliers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. In particular, we may use an analytics service provider for website traffic analysis and reporting and to track information such as which browser, screen resolution and IP address you are using to access our website, in addition to tracking your movements around our Site.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file, which is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server and this enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. Therefore, we may send a cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. In particular, they enable us:

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognise you when you return to our site.
  * To effectively administer the site and improve the site's usability.
  * To use information obtained from cookies for marketing purposes.



You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser, which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

Please note that third party suppliers may also use cookies, over which we have no control and for which we are not liable.

As mentioned above, we may use an analytics service provider for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about site use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our site may be used to create reports about the use of our site and the analytics service provider will store this information.

### 3\. Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Please do not provide your personal data to us if you are not happy for it to be transferred overseas. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Our servers are situated in the UK, however we collect data from wherever users are situated. The information that we collect may therefore be transferred to the UK from any other country in which you may be located and our processing of such data will be subject to UK data protection laws rather than the laws of the country in which you are resident.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers and all electronic transactions made via the site will be encrypted using SSL technology.

We ask you not to share your password, login or user details with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We will retain your information for the duration of the term of your contract with your supplier and for a reasonable period thereafter or as long as the law requires or permits.
