####  General Information

The Privacy Policy of GavickPro is used to protect our customers' privacy and security of information stored and shared with us through www.gavick.com. Through the act of registering with and using our website, you automatically give consent to use and disclose information as needed. If you do not agree with the terms defined below, you should not use products or services offered by GavickPro.

####  Safe and Secure Online Purchase

We realize that using secure online shopping is important to you. Therefore, we use Thawte® Extended Validation SSL Certificate. It is used to keep your information secure while making online transactions with us.

Extended Validation SSL confirms GavickPro has been assessed and that we have instituted the highest standard in Internet security available to commercial industries. It also means that while visiting our site, a green-colored address bar will be visible. Once you click in this field, Thawte® will be displayed as the authority which issued the Extended Validation SSL Certificate. 

####  Information Collection and Use

It is essential that we collect some personal information in order to accurately process your order in a timely fashion. Further, we require specific username and password information for you to access our website when desired. At the time of registration, you provide consent for us to periodically send you informative email messages. In addition, your data is used when you access technical support. In the case of the issuing of invoices, it is the responsibility of the buyer to provide us with such additional personal information such as full name, email address and mailing addresses.

Your personal information may also be used as required for the purpose of legal action. Protection and defence of the rights and property of GavickPro are taken into consideration, as well as any merger or other business action.

####  Changing / Updating Personal Data

If you give us permission to send you information updates, including newsletters about product upgrades, updates, new products / services, or discounts available, you must remember to keep us informed when you change your email address. If you are unable to make such changes yourself on our website, we will do it at your request. Also, remember that you can cancel email notifications at any time at gavick.com.

####  Protection of Personal Information

Information gathered and stored at gavick.com is fully protected. We do our best to secure data collected from customers and we do not disclose it to any unauthorized person or organization. All data is restricted to GavickPro employees and external service providers only, which are entitled to use it to fulfill business functions. Misuse of this data is forbidden and GavickPro will take appropriate disciplinary action as required should we learn that personal data we store was used in an unapproved manner. 

Please note that GavickPro does not take responsibility for data used in a Paypal financial transaction when purchases are made at gavick.com. Paypal is responsible for accepting and verifying your financial account details. As a result, your financial details are not stored on our system.
