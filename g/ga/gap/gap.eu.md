You can contact us as described in the section entitled "How do I contact you?" to request access to or more information about the use of personal information or to ask us to change, update, delete and/or suppress personal information. Please note that certain personal information may be exempt from such access, correction, deletion or suppression rights pursuant to local data protection laws. We will respond as required by applicable law. Further, if we provide functionality on any of our websites that permits you to set up an account on the site, you may log into your account to access and change your personal information.

In any contact with us in this regard, you must clearly indicate: the information that you wish to have changed; the information that you wish to have suppressed from our database; or the limitations you wish to put on our use of your personal information. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed. We are not responsible for changing, updating, deleting or suppressing personal information in the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your personal information, or limiting their use of your personal information.

Gap Companies and our brands want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive promotional information, such as information about special offers and sales events, from one or more of our brands, you can let us know by contacting our customer service as described in the section entitled, "How do I contact you?", below or by following the "opt out" instructions provided in promotional emails sent to you.

Please be sure to include your full name and the email address you used when you registered with or made a purchase from our brand(s). If you ask us to remove your name and address from promotional lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not contact" file in order to honour your request.

If you change your mind, you can start receiving promotional communications from us again by signing up when you visit our websites or our stores or when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or by contacting customer service.

Our websites are not targeted to or intended for use by children. We ask that children under 18 not transmit any personal information to us. Where specifically requested, we welcome the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 to provide relevant information about the child.

Non-personal information is information that does not identify you. It may include information you have provided to us such as demographic data, for example, your gender, birthday, and personal interests. Non-personal information also includes aggregate information, for example, using personal information to calculate the percentage of our customers who like a particular brand.

When you visit our websites, the Gap Companies collect non-personal information that may include your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, IP address (as further described below), cookies (as further described below), pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies (as further described below) to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our websites.

The Gap Companies may use non-personal information and share non-personal information with other third parties for any purpose. The Gap Companies may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as combining your geographic location with your name, but if we do this the information will be treated by us as personal information for so long as it is combined.

Our websites use "cookies," which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online experience. For example, we may use cookies to enable you to use certain website features, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to our website, and monitor and maintain information about your use of our websites. Cookies may also be used to collect transaction information needed by a scrip or loyalty program to which you have authorized us to provide your personal information. (See the section entitled, "Do Gap Companies share my information?", above.) They may also be used to provide you with personalised advertisement banners while browsing other reputable sites. These advertisements will relate to products which have been viewed while browsing this website on your computer or any other device. We are committed to only providing you with information which is relevant to you and which you want to receive. Accordingly, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, certain features of our websites may not be available to you. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

We use "pixel tags" (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images, and other similar technologies on our websites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. Pixel tags on our sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the sites. This information may include your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our site. Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.

We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you. This information may be used to improve our websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor our communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, to understand your preferences and for other internal business purposes.

We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. We are committed to only providing you with information which is relevant to you and which you want to receive. Accordingly, if you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having your information used by these companies, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number may be different each time you log onto the Internet or it may remain the same. The IP address is logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit our websites, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you visited. It is also collected by pixel tags, as described above. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

We may use IP addresses for the same purposes for which we use personal information, as well as for calculating website usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering our websites and your use of our websites including providing opportunities to you and fulfilling your requests and purchases. Except where otherwise required by law, we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information.

We have in place physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to help protect the security and privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure. When you enter your personal information on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your personal information as it is transmitted to us.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive information through email. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as described in the section entitled, "How do I contact you?" below. If you choose to notify us by physical mail this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.

For your convenience and information, our websites may contain links to other sites, which may have privacy practices and policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the content or practices of any linked site. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that you access through our sites. The inclusion of a link to a third-party site on our websites does not imply that any of the Gap Companies endorses the site.

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
