### How does Gap Inc. share my personal information?

We may share your personal information in the following ways:

  * **Brands.** When you provide personal information to one of our Gap Inc. brands (Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Gap Factory, Banana Republic Factory, Athleta, or Intermix), we may share that information with our other Gap Inc. brands.
  * **By You.** You may disclose personal information when you post content to our websites, in-store technologies or other public forums, such as our brands’ social media pages, blogs, and online product reviews. Any information that you disclose through these services will become public.
  * **Social Sharing.** Your personal information may be disclosed in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you log into your customer account from your social media account. By connecting your customer account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.
  * **Service Providers.** We may share your information with our service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as fulfilling promotions, sending communications to our customers, conducting surveys, etc. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information. These service providers may be located inside and outside Canada including but not limited to the United States.
  * **Third Parties.** We may share your information when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests, or promotions to our customers.
  * **Legal Requirements**. We may share information about you if necessary or appropriate, in our good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations or in response to a valid subpoena, order, or government request, or to protect the operations, privacy, safety, property or rights of Gap Inc. or others.
  * **Scrip or Loyalty Programs**. If you choose to participate in any third-party scrip, loyalty, or similar program in which a Gap Inc. brand is a participating vendor, and you authorize Gap Inc. or our credit card processor to provide information about your purchases to the company administering the program, we will share your personal information with that program. Scrip programs allow you to instruct us to divert a percentage of the amount you spend on Gap Inc. purchases to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Gap Inc. brands, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. The information you authorize us to disclose to the third-party scrip or loyalty program may include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide. Please note that once we disclose this information, the scrip or loyalty company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.
  * **Business Transfer**. In the unlikely event of a sale or merger of Gap Inc. or any of our businesses, our customers' personal information and other information we have collected as described in this policy may be among the transferred business assets.

  * **Cookies** : Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Our websites, online advertisements, and emails use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your interactions, such as browser type, pages viewed, links clicked, and other actions you take in connection with our websites, online ads, and email. We use the information for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience, to understand how our websites are used, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and for security purposes. If your browser is set to decline cookies, you may not be able to access your customer account or make a purchase on our websites. To learn how we use cookies for advertising, please see the section, How is my information used for behavioral or targeted advertising and what choices do I have? below.



If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. If you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our sites. For example, you may not be able to access your account information or make a purchase on our websites.

  * **Analytics** : We use third-party service providers, including Google and Adobe, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our websites and mobile applications and in-store technologies. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.

We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.

### I received a suspicious email from a Gap Inc. brand regarding an order I did not place. What should I do?

We are aware of phony emails sent out under our brand names. These emails did not originate from Gap Inc., and individuals who received fraudulent order status emails have not been charged. For your protection, do not click links or open any files attached to suspicious, unsolicited emails. If you believe your personal computer has been compromised as a result of the scam, please consult an IT professional. For more information, contact the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at <http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/index-eng.htm> or the CRTC’s Spam Reporting Centre at <http://fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/frm-eng/MMCN-9EZV6S>. We work with law enforcement on their investigations of these kinds of fraudulent emails.

### I responded to an online job posting for a Gap Inc. job that requires me to upload personal financial information. Is this part of your hiring process?

No. Gap Inc. does not ask prospective job applicants for information about their bank accounts, credit history or passwords to financial accounts. If you are asked for personal financial or security information in response to a job application, this is likely a fraudulent job listing hosted by spammers posing as Gap Inc. or its affiliates to mislead job applicants. You can validate all Gap Inc. and its affiliates’ job postings on [gapinc.com/careers](http://www.gapinc.com/content/gapinc/html/careers.html). Spammers also create phony aliases such as thegap-usa.com to mimic our company and/or brand names in an effort to commit identity theft or other forms of fraud. If you receive this type of suspicious email activity, please alert the Government of Canada's Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at [info@antifraudcentre.ca](mailto:info@antifraudcentre.ca)

back to top

### How do I contact you?

For questions about our privacy Policy, to make choices about receiving promotional communications, to access, or update or correct your personal information, or to place an order, you can contact any of our Gap Inc. brands by email, telephone, or postal mail.
