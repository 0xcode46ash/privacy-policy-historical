What kind of information does Gap Online collect?

We collect information (such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone and credit card numbers) that you provide when you place an order, register with us or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We also maintain a record of your product interests and your purchases online and in our stores. We may acquire from third parties customer names and mailing addresses for select postal mailings.

How does Gap Online use my information?

When you make a purchase from Gap Online, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order. When you register with Gap Online or participate in a contest or promotion (online, over the phone, or at one of our retail stores) you may choose to receive emails from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you emails to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve our site design and your shopping experience. If you make a purchase online or over the phone, we may also send you notices about our products, services, contests and promotions through postal mail.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online and in our stores as well as information about your product interests and purchases. In addition, we may combine information you provide with demographic information that is publicly available. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you by email or postal mail about our products, services, contests, and promotions that may be of interest to you.

Does Gap Online share my information with third parties?

We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information to fulfill promotions and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information.

In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.

If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive information from us, you may still receive information from or about Gap Online in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Gap Online or share your information with us and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions.

We may occasionally participate in scrip, loyalty and other similar programs. Scrip programs allow you to instruct Gap and Gap.com to divert a percentage of the amount you spend at Gap and Gap.com to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Gap and Gap.com, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty or other similar program in which Gap is a participating vendor, the company administering the scrip, loyalty or other similar program (collectively, the "scrip company") will or should ask for your consent to have Gap and Gap.com or our credit card processor(s) share with the scrip company information regarding your Gap and Gap.com purchases. This information will include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may include your name. We will provide this information to the scrip company only as you have authorized us to do so. The scrip company may also share this information with the organizations you have chosen to receive a percentage of or information regarding your Gap and Gap.com purchases. Many scrip companies have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.

We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you, (such as age, gender, and types of products purchased) with our business partners to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online to any unaffiliated third party.

How does Gap Online protect kids' privacy?

Like you, we at Gap Online are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. Please note: we may nevertheless maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.

What are cookies? How does Gap Online use cookies on its site?

A cookie is a small data file that Web sites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID), that is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.

We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. When you visit Gap Online, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. If you are a registered customer, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. If you register with or order from us, we also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our site. If you have not registered with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.

We also use cookies to track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to ours to further improve our site design and to fulfill contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web sites.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.

What about links to other Web sites and services?

Gap Online may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These Web sites have their own policies regarding privacy, which you should review before visiting them. We have no responsibility for linked Web sites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, you can contact , call us at 1-800-GAP-STYLE (1-800-427-7895) or write us at Gap Online Customer Services, 100 Gap Online Drive, Grove City, OH 43123-8605.

**Our Security Safeguard**  
At gap.com we don't just stand behind our merchandise. We also do our best to provide a safe and convenient online shopping experience. 

That means we safeguard the integrity of our customers' credit card information. If your credit card or debit card ("credit card") is used in an unauthorized manner on our site (as determined by your credit card company), we will cover whatever amount your credit card company doesn't – up to $50. 

If you're not quite comfortable shopping online, or would prefer to make your purchase via telephone, just give us a call at 1-800-GAP-STYLE, option 1. Our Customer Service representatives are standing by 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They'll be happy to take your gap.com order right over the phone. 

**Credit Card Safety**  
Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us. 

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. 

SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it's a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our website's servers. 

If someone steals your credit card information or uses your credit card in an unauthorized manner on our site (as determined by your credit card company) – through no fault of your own – we'll cover up to $50 of the charges your credit card company doesn't. What's more, we'll do what we can to make the whole process as hassle-free as can be. 

**What about my bank or credit card company?**  
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank or credit card company cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card. Your liability for unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher, but most debit card issuers voluntarily apply the $50 limit to their cards, as well. If your bank does hold you liable for any amount up to $50, gap.com will cover the liability imposed on you, up to $50. Gap.com will cover this amount **only** if the unauthorized use of your credit card occurred at gap.com and through no fault of your own. 

Remember: If unauthorized use of your credit or debit card does occur, you must notify your card provider, in accordance with the agreement you have with the company. 

**How do I know my credit card information is secure?**  
To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to " **https**." 

Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at gap.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-GAP-STYLE, option 1. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
