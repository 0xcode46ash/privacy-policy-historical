This Online Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected through our Site.

This Online Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Use for our Site.

### What Personal Information Do We Collect on Our Site?

Information You Volunteer. We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use our Site, for example, the information you provide when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or other information from our Site.

Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser.

The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve our Site and our business. However, if you have created a user profile on our Site, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs -- which contain visitors' IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

_Information Collected Using "Cookies" and Other Web Technologies._ Like many commercial sites, we use "cookies," and similar technologies to collect information and manage our Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer. We may use two types of cookies -- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."

A "session cookie" assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access our Site. A session cookie expires after you close your browser. Generally, we use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use our Site. This information is known as "click-stream information." Session cookies may also be used to facilitate your interactions with our Site.

We may also use "persistent cookies." These cookies do not expire when you close your browser, but stay on your computer until they expire or you delete them. Each time you visit our Site, our Web server may recognize you by "searching" the information contained in these cookies. By assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences. This permits us to offer you a personalized experience when you use our Site. Assigning your computer a persistent, unique identifier also helps us keep a more accurate account of how many people visit our Site, how often they return, how their use of our Site may vary over time, and the effectiveness of our promotional efforts.

Neither session cookies nor persistent cookies identify you personally. If, however, you have created or modified a profile on our Site, or if you access our Site by clicking on a link in an email we have sent you, we may link the information collected by our cookies to information that identifies you personally.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit our Site, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of our Site.

### How Do We Use Your Personal Information?

We use the personal information collected through our Site to provide you information you may request; to improve our Site; and for any other purposes related to our business.

### With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?

We may share personal information collected through our Site with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide data management or other support services to us (such as data storage, web hosting, or e-mail services). We may also share the information collected through our Site with Gatestone Institute and any of our affiliates, subsidiaries, or related entities (the "Gatestone Affiliates"). The Gatestone Affiliates may disclose the personal information collected through our Site when we or they, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law (or a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce the terms of use or other agreements that govern your use of our Site; to protect the rights, property or safety of the Gatestone Affiliates or any of our users or others; or to protect your vital interests. Information submitted to our Site is an asset of the Gatestone Affiliates and will become part of the Gatestone Affiliates' normal business records. Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired the assets of any of the Gatestone Affiliates, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Online Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

### Modifying Your Information

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. You may update or modify your information at any time by sending an e-mail to [info@gatestoneinstitute.org.](mailto:info@gatestoneinstitute.org)

### Transfer of Data Abroad

If you are visiting this Site from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located (currently USA) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting our Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this policy.

### Links to Third-Party Websites

Our Site may contain links to websites that are not operated by us. These links are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party websites nor any association with their operators. We do not control these websites and we are not responsible for their data practices.
