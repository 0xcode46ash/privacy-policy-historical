There are currently two places on GateWorld.net where you will be asked for your e-mail address: when sending us feedback or news tips, and when registering for **GateWorld Forums**. The forums are currently hosted by Delphi Forums, and are subject to Delphi's [privacy policy](http://www.delphi.com/dir-html/privacy.html) and [terms of service](http://www.delphi.com/dir-delphi/agreement.htm).

GateWorld.net is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. **Your name or e-mail address will not be sold or disclosed to any third party under any circumstances** , except in cooperation with law enforcement.
