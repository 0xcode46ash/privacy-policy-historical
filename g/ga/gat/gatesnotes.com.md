# Bill Gates – Privacy Policy – The Gates Notes

This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the [Terms of Use](http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Terms-Of-Use/default.aspx) governing use of The Gates Notes website ("www.thegatesnotes.com"). Parts of those Terms of Use affect this Privacy Policy, so unless you have already done so, please review them prior to using the Website. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Statement have the definitions provided in the Terms of Use. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information collected from visitors to the Website. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time by updating this posting, with the new terms taking effect on the date of posting. You can determine if any changes were made to this Privacy Policy by noting the date that the Privacy Policy was last updated.

We collect some information automatically from visitors to the Website; for example, through the use of "cookies" and other tracking mechanisms. We collect at least the following: your domain name and host for Internet access; the Internet address of the site from which you came; the date and time of your access; your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, browser and host; the date and time you access the Site and the pages you visit. For each visitor to the Website, our servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name of visitors. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. 

It is always your choice, or the choice of anyone acting for you, whether to provide personal information. However, some information must be provided to participate in certain activities (such as posting to the "Infrequently Asked Questions" section), so the decision not to provide information might limit or eliminate your ability to participate in those. The kinds of personal information we will request about you typically includes only your name and email address. Other information is up to your good judgment, e.g., do not provide personal information about yourself that do not want to see published on the Website (and possibly other websites), and do not provide personal information about others without their permission. By submitting any personal information about others, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.

We generally do not provide to anyone else any personally identifiable information relating to Website users other than information that Website users post on interactive sections of the Website. We may use anonymous information gathered from the Website for the management and improvement of the Website. 

We reserve the right to disclose all information collected via the Website, internally or to third parties, for any lawful purpose or to prevent harm to us or others. For example and without limitation, in our discretion we may disclose information to government regulators, law enforcement authorities or alleged victims of identity theft. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law. 

We may place a "cookie" on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on websites and many major websites use them to provide useful features to their visitors. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted our Website. You may set your browser to reject cookies, but please understand that certain features of the Website may not be available if your browser does not accept cookies. We never use or install spyware on your computer. 

We also may use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (c) track entries, submissions, and status in any interactive portion of the Website.

The Website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions of use, or any of the content of such websites. The linked sites may collect personal information from you that is not subject to our control. The data collection practices of linked sites will be governed by that site's privacy policy.

Our primary audience is adults and young adults. We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Any use of the Website by children under the age of 13 should be conducted under the supervision of that child's parent or guardian. Information should not be submitted to or posted at the Website by anyone under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Children can browse the Website without any personal information being collected. If a child has provided his or her personal information, a parent or guardian may so inform us by going to the "Contact" link at the bottom of our home page and using the General Inquiry form located there, and we will use reasonable efforts to delete that child’s personal information from our database (subject to applicable law and this Privacy Policy). If we learn that a user under 13 years of age has submitted personally identifiable information online, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law). We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or other matters that relate to it, you may contact us by going to the "Contact" link at the bottom of our home page and using the General Inquiry form located there.
