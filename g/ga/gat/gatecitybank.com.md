Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

 **How does Gate City Bank protect my personal information?**| 

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

We collect your personal information, for example, when you

Federal law gives you the right to limit only

  * Sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes - information about your creditworthiness

State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
