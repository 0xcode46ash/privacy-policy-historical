# Gateway.com: About Gateway : Legal : Security & Privacy

**Online Privacy Statement**  
Gateway respects our customers' right to privacy online. We hold your detailed customer information in confidence.

  
We will sometimes ask customers for personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, occupation, hobbies and other details. Providing us your information will simply help us offer products and services that we think you'd like to hear about. When you choose to give personal information to us over the Internet that we or our business partners may request, we will endeavor to inform you how we will use the information.

When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will provide a link to this policy statement to make our intentions clear.

  
Gateway will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting access to customer information databases, communicating this policy statement to all Gateway employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement. Additionally, Gateway annually certifies itself to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program and ensures its adherence to the Safe Harbor’s standards for privacy protection.

Gateway will not sell, rent, or give away our customers' personal information to other companies for use in selling others' products or services. When we do contract with another company to market or advertise products or services for us, we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting our customer information. We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements we have with other companies.

We gather personal information from our customers so we can better develop our relationship with those customers. Occasionally, we seek customer comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services our customers should be made aware of based on their specific needs.

We will communicate with customers via e-mail or other online delivery devices only if the customer agrees to receive those communications. Customers who believe they are receiving our communications in error or no longer desire to receive them, should inform us and we will remove those customers' names from our mailing lists. Gateway will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with customers. We will, at all times, put ourselves in the place of the recipients of our mail and treat our customers as we ourselves would like to be treated.

Our site shares Web site usage information about visitors to our Web site with reputable third-party companies for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on this site and other sites as well as for gathering aggregate information about site traffic and usage. For these purposes, we and our third-party companies note some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The information collected by our third-party advertiser through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. Some of the information collected by our third-party analytics provider may be personally identifiable; however, our provider is contractually precluded from selling, licensing or conveying any such information to any third party or from using that information in any way outside Gateway’s own privacy policy. [View more information](http://www.privacychoices.org/) about our third-party advertiser, or [opt out](http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm) of the targeting program. [View more information](http://www.coremetrics.com/privacy/privacy.html) about our third-party analytics provider, including how to opt out of the data collection.

  
We currently use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your information, including your credit card number, during online transactions. None of the tens of thousands of people who have made purchases through Gateway's Web site using SSL, have reported to us fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their online order. We believe SSL to be a very safe encryption method, but we are always looking for even more secure encryption methods to safeguard information sent online. Our server will run detection software to help ensure you are using a secure browser and your information is secure when you check out. If our browser determines you are not using a secure browser, a message will appear at checkout.

For more information on SSL technology, [please click here](https://web.archive.org/about/legal/ssl.shtml).

To protect your information once your transaction is complete, Gateway stores your information on an off-line server stored securely behind our firewall. There is no external access to this information and its internal access is strictly monitored.

For your protection, never put your credit card number or other sensitive information in unencrypted e-mail. In the extremely unlikely event that we ever do suspect a customer's credit card number has been intercepted, we will immediately notify the customer.

  
As your trusted guide in today's online commerce, Gateway helps ensure your protection by offering a safe shopping guarantee. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 in unauthorized or fraudulent charges. Gateway will cover the amount for which you are held liable up to the full $50 if the fraudulent transaction resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Gateway.com using our secure server. Gateway also requires that you have followed all rules and procedures of your credit card provider relating to fraudulent and authorized use.

  
Gateway currently uses "cookies" on our site. Our cookies tag each visitor's browser with a random, unique number. The cookie simply assigns a number and does not disclose any personal information about the person using the browser. By noting where these uniquely numbered browsers go on our site, we can study traffic patterns and improve our site.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with Gateway, please contact [Webmaster](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailtoforms.pl?mailinfo=webmaster:webmaster@gateway.com). If you wish to update or correct the personal information about you held by Gateway, please call 800-846-2000.
