# Gateway.com: Privacy

Gateway wants to be your trusted guide in this digital age. The foundation of that role is building life-long relationships with our clients based on mutual trust and respect.

As part of this relationship, we want to assure you that we will always respect your privacy. From time to time on our Web site or in phone or face to face conversations, we'll ask you for information. Beyond your name and address, we may ask for your e-mail address, telephone number, occupation, the size of your family, your hobbies - things that will help us offer products and services that can help you get the most of technology.

You can be certain that Gateway will never sell, rent, or disclose in any manner, personal information you give us to any other company for their use in selling their products and services. When we do contract with another company to market or advertise products or services for us, we will require those companies to protect your information consistent with our stringent practices.

Whenever we ask for this information, we'll be clear about why we want it and will include links to this note and the [Online Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20000621101704id_/http%3A//www.gateway.com/about/spotnews/online_privacy.shtml) posted on this site. We use strong, online industry standard encryption to assure your order information remains safe. But beyond that, we always encourage Gateway employees to treat your information as they would like to have similar information about themselves treated.

We welcome your comments on this policy. Thank you for visiting our site and we look forward to building a long-term relationship with you.

**Ted Waitt  
Chairman of the Board
