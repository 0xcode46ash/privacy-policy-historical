# Gates Cambridge Scholarships - Privacy Policy

Your right to privacy is important to us. We are keen to strike a fair balance between your privacy and ensuring that you obtain full information from this site.

 **Personal Data**

In some areas of our website we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your visit to the website or reply to you after your visit. This includes where you complete a form to make an enquiry or request.

We may use your personal data for future email contact, support, general correspondence and other correspondence which we feel may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive future emails from us please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

The information you provide will be kept confidential and will be used only to support your relationship with us as outlined in this policy or elsewhere on this website. We will not transfer or disclose your information to third parties without your prior consent.

 **Updating and controling your details**

Members can update their details through this website by logging into their account. You can control what information about you is available on the public and members’ websites and your contact preferences in [your profile](http://www.gatescambridge.org/members/) in the members’ area of the website. Requests for removal from any mailing list which we operate will always be dealt with promptly.

 **Sharing data with the University of Cambridge**

We are proud of our Alumni and want to stay in touch. The Trust and the University have a shared interest in and co-ordinated approach to their alumni and supporters. 

The records are used by the Trust for alumni relations purposes. These include publications, alumni surveys, appeals and the marketing of alumni events [and services]. Communications may be sent by post, telephone or, increasingly, electronic means.  Most records contain education, contact details and career and other achievements. Other information from the University may be added from time to time. Please read the University’s data protection statement, which explains how it handles and uses data it collects at <http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/dataprotection>.

All information is held and transmitted securely and (in addition to disclosure as permitted or required by law) may be disclosed on a considered and confidential basis only to the University and, as necessary, to volunteers working on behalf of the Trust.

You are in control. If you have any queries, wish to restrict data processing or sharing including use for marketing or do not want to be contacted by the Trust, please inform us by calling + 44 (0)1223 338467or by emailing [info@gatescambridge.org](mailto:info@gatescambridge.org). (Minimal information is always retained to make sure you are not contacted again inadvertently.) You will also need to contact the University or your College separately if you wish to restrict University or College data processing, sharing, marketing or contact. We will publish any changes we make to this data protection statement and, where appropriate, notify you by email.

 **Your consent**

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of our services will signify that you agree to any such changes.
