## Privacy Policy

    At Gnolia Systems, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you on the Ma.gnolia Pre-launch site to communicate with you only about Ma.gnolia’s launch and nothing more. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.
What information does Ma.gnolia collect on its pre-launch site? How do we use it?
    When you sign-up to receive a notification of Ma.gnolia’s launch, we collect your email address. That email address is used to send you your requested communications about Ma.gnolia’s launch only.
    For certain types of sign-ups, we may also request a specific code to identify you as a pre-selected V.I.P. member. Once that code is entered, we do not use it to further track you.
    For members participating on the Ma.gnolia development blog, we may collect your screen name, should you choose to provide one, and any comments left by you on the blog. This information is used solely to enhance your communication experience on the blog and not for any additional Ma.gnolia purposes. However, comments left on the Ma.gnolia development blog do become the property of Gnolia Systems, LLC.
How does Gnolia Systems protect customer information?
    When you provide information or log into a protected area on the Ma.gnolia web site, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for Gnolia Systems are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates. To learn more about our online security, simply click on the "Security" icon (it usually appears as a padlock) in your browser tool bar, at the bottom of your browser window.
Will Gnolia Systems disclose the information it collects to outside parties?
    Absolutely not. Gnolia Systems will not sell, trade or rent the personal information you submit—period. Gnolia Systems may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
