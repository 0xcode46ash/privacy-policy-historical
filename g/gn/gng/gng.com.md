# Privacy Policy | Georgia Natural Gas

Your privacy is important to Georgia Natural Gas®. Personal information is required only to sign up for service with GNG. Any information provided will be used exclusively by GNG, our agents, suppliers, and third-party service providers for internal use or to respond to your request. GNG may, however, release your name and address in connection with joint marketing efforts and strategic alliances. GNG will not sell or distribute any other personal information collected at this site to any unaffiliated party without your consent, unless doing so is required by law or necessary to protect or deliver our services, enforce terms of service, or prevent a violation of someone's rights. GNG also may exchange information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and collection activities.

GNG may send you e-mails with promotional offers only if you opt-in to receiving such emails. If you would no longer like to receive emailed special event information, sales notifications or other promotional messages from GNG, please click the link at the bottom of any email you receive from us and follow the instructions, or alternatively you may send an email to GNGemail@response.gng.com with the word “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “REMOVE” in the subject line. Your email address will be removed from our marketing list. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request, as some promotions may already be in process.

From visitors to our Web site, GNG's server gathers nonpersonal information (“cookies”) for statistical and market research purposes.
