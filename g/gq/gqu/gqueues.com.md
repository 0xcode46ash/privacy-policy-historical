#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

All users of GQueues are required to login using their Google Account™ or Google Apps™ account. Google has made available certain account information to GQueues for use including your email address. To modify any of your Google account information, please use the means provided by Google. GQueues is not affiliated with Google and does NOT have access to, nor does it store your Google account password.

##### List contents and usage

The contents of your GQueues account are stored and maintained on Google servers which host the GQueues web application. Because Google keeps backup copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of task list contents may remain on Google's systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account.

GQueues also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in, and other information related to your registration and use of the GQueues web application. Information displayed or clicked on in your GQueues account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the GQueues user interface.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
