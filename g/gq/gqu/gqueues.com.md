##### Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

##### List contents and usage

The contents of your GQueues account are stored and maintained on Google servers which host the GQueues service. GQueues also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in, and other information related to your registration and use of the GQueues service.

We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the GQueues user interface.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.

We store your personal information in the Google Cloud Platform for the purpose of providing the service. We may provide your personal information to other companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as surveying users for feedback and for payment processing. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary_ to provide these services to us. Your personal information will not be used for secondary purposes without prior notification and express consent obtained. You can withdraw consent at anytime by emailing [privacy@gqueues.com](mailto:privacy@gqueues.com).

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If GQueues is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.

If you refuse to provide your email address to GQueues you will not be able to use the service. Other personal information may be withheld, but will result in a degraded user experience.
