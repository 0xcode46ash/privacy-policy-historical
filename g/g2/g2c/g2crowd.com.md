## What information we collect from you and why we collect it.

**In General.**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way. This may include information that can identify you (“personal information”), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, user name, and password. Additionally, if you connect to our Site through LinkedIn, we will receive information from your LinkedIn account as further described below. We may also request information about your usage of technology products and services and your preferences in choosing technology products and services. You can choose not to provide information to us, but, in general, some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member of our Site. For example, only registered members are able to post technology reviews, participate in discussion forums, email content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and technology research content, and enter surveys or promotion. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.

**Information about Others.**

You may have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Site. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing G2 with their personal information.

**Information from LinkedIn.**

If you connect to our Site through your LinkedIn account, we will receive:

  1. your LinkedIn profile information and will automatically populate your profile on our Site with your company name, industry, company size, and skills from your LinkedIn profile, however, you can request that this information not be shown publicly on our Site (though please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and we cannot and do not guarantee that this information will not be viewed by unauthorized persons);
  2. access to your LinkedIn connections to show you reviews written by your connections, however, we will not access your connections’ contact information nor send messages to your connections.



You can add an email address in your account for our Site that differs from the email address(es) in your LinkedIn account. You also can turn off or adjust the frequency of notifications you receive from us through your LinkedIn account.

We will never post anything to your LinkedIn account on your behalf without your permission.

**Information from Other Sources.**

We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners, and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit our Site by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third-party services, such as social media services, through our Site or before coming to our Site, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services in order to improve and personalize your use of our Site.

**Automatic Information.**

We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit the Site. For example, we will collect session data, including the time at which you visited our Site, your IP address, web browser software, referring website, information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies. We also will collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and keywords searched or used. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience, including through behavioral advertising, on the Site and/or other sites you may visit.

  2. Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Site.

  3. Web Beacons. Pages of our Site and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).



We do not collect personal Information automatically, but we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or you provide to us.

G2 and its affiliated websites use these technologies for the following general purposes:

  1. To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our Site. For example, if you register on our Site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our Site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled “Save this password for automatic sign-in.” Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
  2. To help us customize the content and website experience provided to you on our Site and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page on our Site, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information based on your apparent interests. This information may relate to our Site and the information provided on it and/or to products and services offered by our partners or the providers of products and services listed on our Site.
  3. To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications. For example, we work with third-party service providers to collect data about your use of the Site and the pages you visit for purposes of conversion tracking and serving ads targeted to your interests as you visit other websites across the Internet and to determine which emails you open and act upon.



You can opt out of some or all of the foregoing uses, including interest-based advertising, through the Do Not Track functionality in your web browser.
