# ::GG2.net::

At AMG we take privacy very seriously. Throughout the data collection process, all necessary steps are taken to ensure that data is used only according to the purposes that we have clearly stated.

Purposes for which information is collected All information collected is regulated by the UK Data Protection Act. Asian Media & Marketing Group, is duly registered as a data collector for various purposes under the Act. In the case of gg2.net, data collected may be used for the following purposes:

For the purpose of providing the service requested by you, e.g. sending publications and/or related material. AMG will screen your application against our terms of control and inform you if you do not qualify for any of our publications. We will also use your details to contact you when it is time to renew for another year. 

To learn more about our readers and thus to improve the content and relevance of our editorial. Some of the demographic data is used to provide reports and statistics to prove the quality of our readership to our advertisers and this is verified by our circulation auditors. The data shown to advertisers is always provided in report format as anonymous data. Without advertising we simply would not be able to keep sending our free magazines. 

For the purpose of direct marketing by AMG and other companies. This implies that we may from time to time send you information about AMG or other products, magazines, or conferences, and that we may pass your name and address or other contact details, on to third parties whose products or services we believe you might be interested in.
