### Summary

If you only browse ggftw.com (/gg FTW!), we will only collect information as captured by the server logs. This includes IP address, date/time of access, file/script accessed, and method of access (GET/POST, _etc._ ). This data will be used for internal analytics as well as enforcement of bans/IP blocks and may be surrendered to law enforcement agencies (with a proper subpoena) for investigation of criminal activity. Use of this site constitutes consent to such data collection.

Additionally, /gg FTW! uses Google Analytics for statistical analysis. You may script block "google-analytics.com" if you do not wish for your access trends to be archived by /gg FTW!

By registering an account, you must provide us with an email address and date of birth. /gg FTW! does not target users under 13 years of age and will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from users under 13 years of age. If a user under 13 years of age registers for this site, he or she is in violation of our terms of service and will be banned upon discovery.

If you contribute to the /gg FTW! wiki or post on the /gg FTW! forums, every word you post is published in public domain. You have the option, at any time, to remove information you have posted from /gg FTW!, but the /gg FTW! staff will not remove information for you. If you want it gone badly enough, you will do the work to remove it. Bear in mind, deleting posts/wiki information does not permanently remove it from our databases.

Please do not publish copyrighted information without proper authority to publish such information. We will remove all copyrighted information with a substantiated complaint from the copyright holder upon request.
