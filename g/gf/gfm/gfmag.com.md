# Privacy Policy | Global Finance

We at Global Finance Media (GFM) consider our clients’ privacy to be a top priority, and as such we have developed this Online Privacy Policy.  This Policy details what information we collect, how it is collected, for what purposes it is collected, and the steps we take to secure this information.

If you have questions about this Policy, or if you believe that this Policy has not been adhered to, please e-mail us at mailbox@gfmag.com or call us at (212) 447-7900.

We at GFM recognize that you value your privacy and that when you provide us with your personal information, you place your trust and confidence in us.  To that end, we have implemented appropriate security measures at our physical facilities to guard against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information we have collected from you through the website http://www.gfmag.com and all of its subpages.   
The website automatically logs all visitors. However, no information is automatically collected which identifies any visitor by domain or e-mail address, nor by any other unique identifier.  Be assured that this information is never shared with any third parties for any purpose without your consent.

Beyond the data automatically collected by the website, GFM retains only that personal information which our clients volunteer (for example, information provided in a voluntary survey on the website, or provided in registering for the website).  Such information may include your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or postal address.

If you choose to provide us with your e-mail address, you may receive periodic e-mails from GFM with information about new products, services or upcoming events.  You may opt not to receive these e-mails by e-mailing us your exact name and e-mail address (to ensure the proper entry is removed from our system), as well as a message asking to have your e-mail address removed from the list, at mailbox@gfmag.com. 

GFM may, at times, share e-mail addresses provided by our clients with reputable third party organizations which we believe provide products or services our clients may find interesting or appealing.  We are very selective when determining whether a third party organization is worthy of being entrusted with our clients’ personal information, and we hold those organizations with whom we do share such information to high security and ethical standards To have your e-mail address removed from the list we occasionally share with third party organizations, please send an e-mail asking to be removed from the third party organization e-mailing list, as well as your name and e-mail address, to mailbox@gfmag.com. 

If you choose to provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from GFM with information about new products, services or upcoming events.  You may opt not to receive these mailings by e-mailing us your exact name and address (to ensure the proper entry is removed from our system), as well as a message asking to have your address removed from the mailing list, at mailbox@gfmag.com. 

GFM may, at times, share postal addresses provided by our clients with reputable third party organizations (subject to the same selection criteria as those organizations with which we share e-mail addresses) to provide our clients with information regarding products and services we believe you may find interesting.  To have your address removed from the list we occasionally share with third party organizations, please send an e-mail asking to be removed from the third party organization mailing list, as well as your name and mailing address, to mailbox@gfmag.com. 

If you choose to provide us with your telephone number, you may receive calls from GFM with information about new products, services or upcoming events.  You may opt not to receive these phone calls by e-mailing us your exact name and phone number (to ensure the proper entry is removed from our system), as well as a message asking to have your phone number removed from the list, at mailbox@gfmag.com.

GFM may, at times, share telephone numbers our clients provide with reputable third party organizations (subject to the same selection criteria as those organizations with which we share e-mail addresses) to provide our clients with information regarding products and services we believe you may find interesting.  To have your phone number removed from the list we occasionally share with third party organizations, please send an e-mail asking to be removed from the third party organization phone number list, as well as your name and phone number, to mailbox@gfmag.com. 

If your personal information changes, or if you believe that GFM’s records have inaccurately recorded your personal information, please send an e-mail detailing the outdated/incorrect information and the updated/correct information to mailbox@gfmag.com. 

Be aware that GFM may use our clients’ information for unanticipated purposes not disclosed in this Policy.  We assure you that these uses will always be highly respectful of your privacy concerns and will be subject to the ethical standards of this Policy.  Additionally, if our practices regarding clients’ information changes, this Policy will be updated in a reasonable time and only data collected from the time of the Policy change going forward will be used in the new fashion.  In the event that this Policy changes, we will send an e-mail to all of our clients who have provided an e-mail address informing them of the change.

We remind you that questions, comments or concerns regarding this Policy, or reports of possible violations of this Policy, can be brought to our attention via e-mail at mailbox@gfmag.com or by telephone at (212) 447-7900.
