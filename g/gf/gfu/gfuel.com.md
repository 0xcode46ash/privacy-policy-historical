**Order Gamma-O Securely On-Line**

When you place an order or access your account information at Gamma-O.com you are using our secure server with the best software available for safe commerce transactions. This state-of-the-art technology, called Secure Socket Layers (SSL), keeps your personal information safe by encrypting all of the information you input (including your name, address, and credit card number)before you send it. This makes it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while it is being transferred to our server which provides you with maximum security. Furthermore, all customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. Once we receive your information it is stored in an encrypted form on a server that is not accessible from the Internet. Our private information is not connected to the Internet so hackers can not get to it.

**Still Prefer to Order by Phone or Fax?**

If your browser does not support SSL, or if you are still uncomfortable about sending your credit card information via the Web, we'll be happy to help you via phone, fax or mail. Simply put your items in your shopping cart and proceed to the checkout as if you were completing your order online. Then, print out the shopping cart screen.

To place an order by phone, call our toll-free order line at 1-877-GAMMA-O-2 (1-877-426-6262) between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. from Monday - Friday and one of our helpful Order Entry Reps will assist you with your order and any questions you may have.

To send us your order, simply fax the shopping cart screen printout, along with your name, billing address, credit card information, photo copy of the front and back of your credit card, shipping address and phone number to 631-755-1069, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or mail the information and payment to: Gamma Labs, 113 Alder Street, West Babylon NY, 11704 and we will promptly fill and ship your order.
