| **GECapital.Com PRIVACY POLICY**

At GECapital.Com, protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our goal is to treat the personal information you furnish us with the utmost respect, and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is currently applicable only to our United States customers and visitors when they interact with our website.  
Please read on for details about our practices for handling and securing your personal information. 

**ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION**  
Additional privacy information that is specific to certain products or services from a GE Capital business can be found on that business's web site. Various laws or the nature of certain products or services may require additional description and disclosures. We encourage you to read this information, as well as the privacy policies of other web sites you visit. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? HOW DO WE USE IT?**

**Anonymous Browsing**  
You can visit the GE companies on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your email address. In this case, our web servers collect the name of the domain you used to access the Internet (such as aol.com) and the web site you came from and visit next. This information is used by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to our web site in general. We also use this data to monitor site performance and to make the site easier and more convenient to use. 

**Personal Information Collection**  
There are times when we may ask you for information about yourself to assist us in meeting your various needs, including:

  * Providing you with products or services you have requested 
  * Servicing your account 
  * Improving our services 
  * Developing and/or informing you of additional products or services that may be of interest 

In these cases, your browsing will no longer be anonymous to us. To provide these services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among other things, your name, social security number, physical address, zip code, e-mail address, and phone number. Also, you may elect to apply online for one of our products or services, which may require us to gather additional information to determine your eligibility. 

Please note that we do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your internet browser on your computer's hard drive. If you are browsing, a cookie is used to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics relating to our web site. This cookie, by itself doesn't tell us your e-mail address or who you are. If you decide to register online with one of GE business units, we may collect additional information to provide tailored offerings or content to you. In this case, we use Cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make your online experience more convenient.

Cookies cannot be used to get data from your hard drive, get your e-mail address or personal identifying information about you. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit our site. 

For Netscape users, Netscape Navigator Version 4.0 began giving users the ability to control cookies. Newer versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer have a similar capability. Refer to these companies' web sites for additional information. 

**SHARING OF INFORMATION AND CONSUMER CHOICE**  
When you provide information to us, we may share your information with our affiliated companies and third parties for the purpose of fulfilling your requests as well as offering you other products and services that may be of interest to you. When you submit personal information to us during your visit to GECapital.Com, we will let you know how you can prevent disclosure of this information to third parties for marketing purposes, if you so choose. We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and services and provide these statistics to third parties; however, when we do, these statistics will not include any personal information that identifies individuals. 

**E-MAIL COMMUNICATION AND ONLINE SURVEYS**  
Occasionally, we will send you e-mail communications with information, which may be useful to you, including information about our products and services or about offerings from affiliates or third parties. When you first provide us with your e-mail address, you will be given the option of not receiving any such e-mail if you choose. We will include instructions in our e-mail messages on how to unsubscribe if you later decide you do not want to receive any future e-mails. 

At times, we conduct online surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option of not participating in such surveys. 

**HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?**  
In some cases you may want to update the information that you have provided to us. This may require you to use a unique user name and password (or "PIN"). Also, where the capability exists, you may request that we modify or delete information we have gathered during your visit. See the GECapital.Com [Contact Us](http://www.gefn.com/contact/index.html) page for additional information. 

**HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?**  
At GECapital.Com, our goal is to protect your personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us. If your communication is very sensitive or includes highly confidential information such as a social security number or a credit card number, you may want to send it by regular mail instead.  
We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information are subject to disciplinary action. 

**WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?**  
GE and its affiliated companies reserve the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy statement at anytime. If we make any material change, we will update our web site to include such changes.
