**Candidate Data Privacy Guidelines**

These guidelines are derived from the GE global Guidelines on Employment Data Protection and Privacy. They are intended to provide candidates with information about the processing of Candidate-related data. For the avoidance of doubt, these guidelines do not form part of your contract of employment (where applicable). GE may amend these guidelines from time to time, should it become necessary to do so. 

GE respects the privacy rights and interests of its candidates and the following principles will be applied when dealing with information that relates to identified or identifiable candidates in connection with your interest in a GE position. This type of information will be referred to as "Candidate Data".

      * GE may collect candidate feedback and opinions periodically (e.g. surveys) for business purposes, such as improving processes, subject to local legal requirements. You may respond to these surveys voluntarily or may elect not to respond and will not suffer reprisals for your decision. These guidelines will be applicable to personal information provided as response to the surveys. 
**_Disclosure Within GE_**
      * To operate as a global business and to promote your career within GE, it is necessary to process and transfer Candidate Data both within GE businesses and GE affiliates. This will involve transferring Candidate Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to the USA and elsewhere. 
      * Processing and/or transfer of Candidate Data and release of information within GE and/or to third parties outside the European Economic Area is subject to local law and, where required, will be subject to candidate consent, as well as ensuring adequate security measures.

      * GE ensures adequate security to protect manual and electronic processing of Candidate Data and prevent its misuse, subject to local legal requirements. 
      * Data sensitivity categories are separated by GE into high, medium, standard and public depending upon the type of data being protected and as appropriate, or otherwise in accordance with local categorization requirements. 
      * GE also ensures adequate security is observed by third parties and affiliates processing Candidate Data on behalf of GE, subject to local legal requirements. 
**_Sensitive Personal Data_**
      * GE ensures special protection for Sensitive Personal Data. This is defined by GE as: 
        * Demographic data (e.g. sex, race, color, ethnic or national origin, religion, philosophical or political beliefs, trade union membership and criminal proceedings); and

      * If required by local law, explicit candidate consent may be obtained to the processing of sensitive personal data. 
**_Data Collection and Candidate Access_**   
Candidates may use various methods of submitting their Candidate Data to GE. These include email or paper submission to GE personnel, online resume submittal which is processed by a third party provider into an electronic database based in the U.S. accessible by GE authorized personnel, or via a GE employment application. In addition, some candidates may be invited to complete separate online questionnaires for our Leadership Programmes where automated decisions will be made based on your responses to the online questionnaires. If your Candidate Data is held in an electronic database, either through your submission process or from completing an online questionnaire:
