# Privacy : GE

### Information we collect and how we use it

  * #### Personal Information

You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) on this Web site. Here are some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the information.

    * ##### Contact Us

If you email us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.

    * ##### Investor Communications E-mail Alerts

If you would like to receive company news alerts from the GE Investor Communications Staff, we ask for your name and email address so we can send you the news alerts.

    * ##### Questionnaires and Surveys

We occasionally may ask visitors to our Web site to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a ge.com survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.

    * ##### Send TV Ads to a Friend

You can send certain GE TV ads to your friends. To do so, we ask you to provide your name and your friend’s email address. We use this information to send the ads to your friend.

    * ##### Order Reports

If you would like to receive the printed General Electric Citizenship Report or Ecomagination Report by postal mail, you may ask for a copy on our Web site. We ask for your contact information so we can send you the report.

    * ##### Request Electronic Delivery of Annual Reports

If you are a GE shareholder and would like to request electronic delivery of annual reports, you may do so on our Web site. We ask for your last name and the last four digits of your account number for verification purposes.

    * ##### Contact GE’s Board of Directors

On ge.com, we provide a phone number, a postal address and an email address so visitors can report complaints about GE accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters or other concerns to the board of directors or Audit Committee. If you email us, please be aware that you will be providing us with your email address and any other information you include in your email.

  * #### Non-Personal Information

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit this Web site. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Web site to our visitors. We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with “web beacons,” as explained below.

    * ##### Cookies

Like many companies, we use browser cookies on this Web site. Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited us before or if you’re a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember though, without browser cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Web site features.

We also use flash cookies on our Web site to enhance your online experience. Flash cookies are similar to browser cookies, except that they can store data more complex than simple text. Flash cookies, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. In addition, flash cookies cannot access or remember your email address or other personal information unless you provide the information on this site. We use flash cookies to provide you with a better user experience. You can manage and disable flash cookies by [clicking here for Manage and Disable Flash Cookies](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=52697ee8 "Manage and Disable Flash Cookies").

    * ##### Web Beacons

Certain pages on our site contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected through web beacons.

GE also uses third party web beacons to help manage online advertising. These web beacons are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our web site. The cookie on your Web browser was placed by GE, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [www.doubleclick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).




### Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. We may share information provided by our visitors to ge.com with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are contractually restricted from using or disclosing the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

### Information We Transfer

We may transfer the personal information we collect on this site to other countries where we do business, but we will do so only for the purposes described above. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described here unless otherwise required by applicable laws.

### Links to Other Sites

We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites may have their own privacy statements in place, which we recommend you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites or any use of the sites.

### Children’s Privacy

This Web site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the site. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on the site, we will delete the information from our records.

Some links on ge.com take Web site visitors to sites that are directed to kids (such as http://kids.ecomagination.com). These Web sites have their own privacy notices that address children’s privacy. We encourage you to read these privacy notices if you visit any linked sites directed to children.

### How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on this Web site. We use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to help keep the personal information you provide on this site secure.
