## Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

**Information Collected Upon Payment** When you purchase any of our products, our third-party payment provider [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) will ask you to provide certain personal information, including your name, credit card number, expiration date, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number. Your credit card information will not be stored on our servers. PayPal employs a variety of security and risk management technologies to facilitate secure on-line transactions and to protect your credit information. You can find more information about PayPal and their privacy policy [here](https://cms.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_US). All information gathered on our Site, or to support back office operations, is transferred over 128-bit or 256-bit encrypted requests directly to PayPal. 

**Information Collected Upon Registration** If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to GelaSkins Inc. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for a User Account, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.

**Additional Information** Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people in the GelaSkins Inc. network to enable you to connect with people on the Site, as specified in your privacy settings. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.

**Use of Contact Information** In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

**Log Data** When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain, from which you are visiting, the web pages you visit, the search terms you use. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the sites technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.
