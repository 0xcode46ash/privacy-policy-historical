# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

General Electric Company, through its Lighting Business ("Operator"), is the operator of this Website ("Site"), although software, hosting and other functions may be provided by Operator's service providers ("Service Providers"), and other companies which are affiliated with Operator ("Affiliates") or merely in a business relationship with Operator ("Business Partners"), each of which may also provide content on the Site or sell or provide goods or services on the Site or advertise or link on the Site. This Privacy Policy describes the type of information Operator and its Affiliates and Service Providers collect from visitors to the Site, what we do with that information, and how visitors can update and control the use of information provided on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not necessarily describe information collection policies on other sites, such as separate sites operated by our Business Partners that we do not control. This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time and without further notice. Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms. If you do not agree to abide by these new terms or any future terms, please do not use the Site. Operator's Service Providers, Affiliates and Business Partners are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Privacy Policy. The Site is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and children under 13 years of age shall not use the Site to submit any individually identifiable information about themselves.

**What Type of Information Do We Collect?**

You are welcome to browse some portions of the Site without becoming a registered user. For some services or areas on the Site, we will ask that you register if you have not already done so and provide us with information about you and/or your company such as name, job title, email address, phone number and other types of identity and contact information which enable us to provide services and information to you. Once we provide you with a user name and password you will be able to access other parts of the Site.

If you use services or tools available through the Site, we may ask you to provide further information, including but not limited to financial information, equipment information, and other personal information. We may collect other personal information when you provide comments or participate in surveys.

When you visit the Site, we collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site. For example, we log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system and CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet Service Provider, to bring you the best possible service. We also record search requests and results to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of our search engine. We use your IP address to track your use of the Site. We also collect information provided by "cookies" stored on your hard drive. Cookies are small data files containing a unique identifier so that we can recognize you each time you return to the Site, and which keep track of the pages you view on the Site and which services you use. This information allows us to provide more tailored and user-friendly services.

We also collect aggregate information about the use of the Site, including which pages are most frequently visited, how many visitors we receive daily, and how long visitors stay on each page.

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to facilitate your activities between us, and to provide you with both general and tailored information about offers, products, services or other useful information from us or others. If you order products or services from us, we may maintain an order history for your account. We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline with the information you have given us online (or vice versa), to provide a more customized experience for you when you deal with us. We use demographic and site usage information collected from visitors to improve the usefulness of the Site and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying, information used in marketing, site advertising, or similar activities.

By visiting the Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of our company we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, for the purposes identified in our other communications with you, or to provide the information to other General Electric businesses and selected third parties which may be outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data. 

As our services evolve, the types of information we collect may change. Please check this Privacy Policy frequently for the most current explanation of our data practices.

**With Whom Do We Share Information?**

We may share your information with our affiliates or selected third parties to achieve the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, in our other communications with you, or on the Site (for example, to provide you additional promotional materials in which you may have an interest). We may provide others aggregate statistics about visitors, Site transactions or other Site activity. 

We may disclose information about you or your company if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Operator, its affiliates or others.

**How Is Your Information Protected?**

Your transmission of some technical or financial information to us is secured through encryption only within certain areas of the site (i.e. GELightnet.com). Likewise, all order forms or requests for quotes submitted through the Site, and billing information and account status information accessible through the Site, are secured via encryption.

While we strive to protect your personal or company information by encryption and other means, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us, and if you choose to use the Site, you do so at your own risk. Additionally, in providing your information over a public or third party network, you do so at your own risk.

Please keep in mind that the information disclosed by you on the Site -- for example, information you may provide to others on bulletin boards or in chat rooms that may be available on the Site -- can be collected and used by visitors to the Site.

**Opting Out, Accessing Or Changing Information**

Operator maintains customer information, including order history and Site usage data, for a length of time appropriate to our business needs. You may contact us to correct or update any personal identifying information that you have submitted to us, or should you have questions about information maintained by us. If you operate in the European Union or other jurisdictions that provide access rights under law, you may access your personal information or have it corrected or updated in accordance with applicable law by contacting us. In some jurisdictions, you may be charged a reasonable fee for access to information. You can opt out of receiving information about non-Operator activities, products or services and/or opt out of having your data provided to third parties for marketing purposes by contacting us.

**Special Provisions for Our European Users**

If you are an individual resident in a Member State of the European Union, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect, use and disclose your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, or any amendments hereto. You further acknowledge and agree that we may transfer your personal data outside of the European Union for purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
