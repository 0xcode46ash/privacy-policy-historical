### Privacy Policy

Our site uses Google Analytics and Google Analytics Advertising to help analyze and understand how users navigate it. The tools use “cookies” (small text files placed on your computer) to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form (including IP address), which is transmitted to Google. Rafflecopter also, by nature, collects anonymous data, but only if you’re using this tool to enter one of our giveaways. This information is used only to evaluate visitors’ usage of the site and to compile statistical reports on website activity or, referring to Rafflecopter, for contacting giveaway winners — nothing more. You can choose to opt out of Google Analytics as a whole [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data, and neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user.

In layman’s terms, any and all information we personally collect will be used for analytical purposes only, or for contacting giveaway winners.

### Targeted Advertising

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

We use cookies to improve your experience on this website. Feel free to change your browser's cookie settings at any time. Hit Ok or scroll down to accept.Ok[Read more](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/)
