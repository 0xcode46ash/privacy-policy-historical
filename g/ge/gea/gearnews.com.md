**What security measures have we taken to protect your data?**

We have taken a variety of security measures to protect personal information to the extent that is required and reasonable.

Our databases are protected by physical, technical and procedural mechanisms that limit access to the data to authorised persons pursuant to this privacy statement. Our information system is behind a firewall to prevent the unauthorized access of other networks that are connected to the internet. Only staff that require the information in order to complete a special task have access to personal information. Our employees are trained in matters of security and data protection processes.

When communicating via email, we cannot guarantee complete data privacy.

**Newsletter**

You have the opportunity to receive a newsletter containing targeted information via our web service. In this case we must collect and save your email address, which we will only use to send the newsletter. You can unsubscribe via our website at anytime. At the end of the newsletter you will find a link intended for this purpose and provides a simple way to cancel the newsletter. In this case your data will be deleted.

**When using our website, a cookie will be stored on your computer. What does that mean?**

We use “cookies” on our website. Cookies are small amounts of data in the form of textual information that the web server sends to your browser. These are saved to your hard disk only. Cookies can only be read by the server that previously placed them and contain information about the content you have viewed on a website and when. Cookies help to make more effective use of the Internet. We use cookies in order to provide you with useful functions. Cookies only identify the IP address of your computer and do not save any personal information such as your name.

You can decide whether to accept cookies. By changing your browser settings (mostly found under “Options” or “Settings” in the browser menu), you have the choice of accepting all cookies, being informed about each cookie or refusing all cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies on our website, it is possible that the functionality of our website may be limited and some services may not be usable. We thank you for your understanding in this matter.

**We use Google Analytics and Google AdSense. What does that mean for your data?**

Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), on our website. Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are saved on your computer and that enable your use of the website to be analysed. The cookie-generated information about your use of our website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. However, if you are in a country that is a member state of the European Union or a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and if IP address anonymisation has been activated on our website, Google will first truncate your IP address. Only by way of exception will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purposes of analysing how you use our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing further services related to website and internet use to the website operator. The IP address transmitted through Google Analytics from your browser will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You can disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly; however, if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our website. You can also prevent the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of this website (including your IP address) being transmitted to and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)

As an alternative to installing the browser plug-in, particularly in internet browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking this link:

https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

This will save an “opt-out” cookie to your device, meaning that none of your data will be collected on this website by Google Analytics.

More detailed information about the function of Google Analytics and the terms of use and privacy policy relevant to this service can be found under [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html) and [http://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/). We would also like to point out that our website uses Google Analytics with the anonymizeIP extension so that IP addresses are only processed further in an abbreviated form to prevent them being directly linked to a particular individual.

Google AdSense

Our website also utilises Google AdSense, a Google Inc. service that allows Google to place automatically generated, content-related advertisements on our website. For further information on Google AdSense, please see [http://www.google.co.uk/adsense](http://www.google.de/adsense). Similarly to Google Analytics, Google AdSense uses cookies that are saved on your computer and that enable analysis of your use of our website. Additionally, Google AdSense utilises “web beacons” (invisible graphics), which also enable an evaluation of your use of our website. The information regarding the use of this website (including your IP address) generated by cookies and web beacons, and the delivery of advertising formats, are transferred to a Google server, where they are saved. Google uses such information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide other services to us in relation to website and internet use. Furthermore, Google may pass on this data to its advertising partners. We would like to point out that, in contrast to Google Analytics, Google has as yet not taken measures to anonymise your IP address for its Google AdSense service. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned data relating to your use of our website, your IP address will also be transferred to, and saved on, a Google server. You can disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly; however, if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our website.

**Your right to information and other rights of the persons affected**

You have the right to access the data stored about you and information concerning its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing free of charge at any time. In addition, you have the right to rectify, delete or block your personal data, provided the legal requirements to do so are met (Section 35 of the German Federal Data Protection Act [BDSG]). If you have any questions about data protection, please feel free to contact us at any time using the details given above.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy in the future without any notice to reflect the way we handle data. You should therefore regularly check this page for any changes to this Privacy Policy.
