##### How We Use Information We Collect

The information collected and the practices described above are done in an effort to provide you with the best experience possible, protect you from risks related to improper use and fraud, and help us maintain and improve Gemini. 

We may share information with trusted and contracted third-party service providers (including those that may be located outside of the United States or your country), who help us operate our platform and systems, and detect fraud and security threats throughout the normal course of our business. Such third-party service providers are subject to strict confidentiality obligations. In addition, we may be compelled to share information with law enforcement, government officials, and regulators. 

For example, we may use your information to:

  * Provide you with Gemini, including customer support for Gemini;
  * Optimize and enhance Gemini, for all users, or for you specifically;
  * Conduct anti-fraud and identity verification and authentication checks (you authorize us to share your information with our third-party service providers, who may also conduct their own searches of publicly available information about you);
  * Monitor the usage of Gemini, and conduct automated and manual security checks of our service; and
  * Create aggregated and anonymized reporting data about Gemini.



If we decide to modify the purpose for which your information is collected and used, we will amend this Privacy Policy.

If we propose to sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your information in an anonymized form to the prospective buyer or seller of such business or assets. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale of Gemini, we will give you notice if, and before, your information is transferred in a non-anonymized form or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We do not sell customer information to third parties for the purposes of marketing.

Be aware that bitcoin, ether, and other Digital Assets are not necessarily truly anonymous.  Generally, anyone can see the balance and transaction history of any public Digital Asset address. We, and any others who can match your public Digital Asset address to other information about you, may be able to identify you from a blockchain transaction. This is because, in some circumstances, information published on a block chain (such as your Digital Asset and IP address) can be correlated with information that we and others may have. This may be the case even if we, or they, were not involved in the blockchain transaction. Furthermore, by using data analysis techniques on a given blockchain, it may be possible to identify other information about you. As part of our security, anti-fraud and/or identity verification and authentication checks, we may conduct such analysis to collect and process such information about you. You acknowledge and agree to allow us to perform such practices.

##### Information Security

We take your privacy very seriously and work hard to protect Gemini and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we collect and store. In particular we encrypt the Gemini website with SSL; we require two-factor authentication for all sessions; we review information collection, storage, and processing practices; and we restrict access to your information on a need-to-know basis for our employees, contractors, and agents who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

##### Accuracy and Retention of Information

We take reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that your information held by us (i) is accurate with regard to the purposes for which it is to be used, and (ii) is not kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it is to be used, which is when your business relationship with us ends, unless the further retention of your information is otherwise permitted or required by applicable laws and regulations.

##### Access to and Correction of Information

You have the right to ascertain whether we hold your accurate and current information, to obtain a copy of your personal data that you submitted as permitted by law, and to correct any of your data that is inaccurate. You may also request that we inform you of the type of information we hold with regard to you. For data access requests, please contact [datarequest@gemini.com](mailto:datarequest@gemini.com).

When handling a data access or correction request, we check the identity of the requesting party to ensure that he or she is the person legally entitled to make such request. A reasonable fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs incurred for complying with your data access request.

##### Direct Marketing

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send direct marketing materials promoting services, products, facilities, or activities to you using information collected from you. An opt-out channel will be provided to enable you to exercise your right to opt out of such direct marketing.
