[](https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/82797c023e9104f85b5fbd42ae556c77)Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for GEMPLER'S® Online Store at http://www.gemplers.com/. At GEMPLER'S®, we value our customers and their privacy. We are committed to protecting your personal information and providing you with a secure online experience. We suggest that you review this privacy policy periodically as we may update it from time to time.

Our privacy policy is designed to protect the private nature of the information you provide us. When you purchase products, sign up to receive our catalog or e-mail newsletter, or register at our site, you will be providing us with personal information including your name, phone number, mailing address, and e-mail address.

We also collect anonymous usage data. We use the usage information to describe in aggregate terms how our website is utilized and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the date and time of each visit, the duration of each visit, and other non-personally identifiable information.

If you provide us with your e-mail address, you will automatically be registered to receive our e-mail newsletter. The GEMPLER'S® E-mail Newsletter includes special offers, notices of clearance and overstock items, as well as company news. You may unsubscribe from the e-mail newsletter at any time. There are unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of every e-mail newsletter that we send. You can unsubscribe using our [online unsubscribe form](https://web.archive.org/a/shop/unsub.asp). We do not share or sell your e-mail address to any third parties.

We occasionally make our customer names, addresses (not e-mail addresses), and limited information about purchases available to carefully screened companies and organizations whose products and activities might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to have your information shared with any other companies, just let us know. We will gladly accommodate your request. Call one of our friendly telephone operators at

Visitors are not required to accept cookies in order to shop online or order from GEMPLER'S®, but it will make your shopping experience easier and more enjoyable. Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

At GEMPLER'S®, we believe that all Internet transactions should be convenient, reliable and secure. To ensure your trust, we've designed a highly secure ordering process and instituted a Credit Card Guarantee that gives you 100% protection for your credit card transactions on our website.

We use Verisign, a well-known company that validates website security. The verification process happens in the background every time you place an order. Security is provided by state-of-the-art technology known as Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to encrypt your personal information, including your credit card number before it is sent. When you enter the checkout area of our website, you move into a secure area to ensure the security of your data as it is transmitted to our server. Once your order is complete, your browser will automatically revert to standard mode, as general browsing does not require encryption. This keeps our website faster so your shopping experience is more enjoyable.

There are several different ways to see if your web browser is in a secure mode. The first way is to look at the bottom of your browser. If you see a small picture of a padlock or a key, you are in secure mode. An open padlock, broken key, or no icon at all, indicates that your web browser may not be in a secure mode. Another way to tell is by looking at the website address in your browser window. Non-secure pages begin with http://. Secure pages begin with https://. The "s" in https:// stands for "secure."

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of the $50.00, GEMPLER'S® will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00, if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at GEMPLER'S® while using our secure checkout. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must promptly notify your credit card provider and follow the procedures outlined in your credit card agreement.

If you have purchased from GEMPLER'S®, subscribed to GEMPLER'S® E-mail Newsletter, or requested a GEMPLER'S® catalog, and you wish to opt-out of the use of your contact information, then you may do so by sending e-mail to [customerservice@gemplers.com](mailto:customerservice@gemplers.com).
