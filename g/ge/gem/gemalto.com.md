# Gemalto's Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how GEMALTO collects, uses, transfers and discloses personally identifiable information obtained through this website at [http://www.gemalto.com](http://www.gemalto.com/) (“Site”). By using this Site or submitting any personally identifiable information to GEMALTO, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

## Active Information Collection

Personally identifiable information may be collected through the Site, including your name and salutation, job title, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other contact information, and other information that is combined with your name or identifiers, such as the products or services requested, name and nature of your business, site activity data, product preference information, marketing permissions, username and password, and delivery and fulfillment information (“Personal Information”). This Personal Information is collected where required or appropriate to facilitate the download or delivery of GEMALTO products and services, to create or maintain user registrations and profiles, to communicate with users and respond to inquiries, to tailor the user experience on the Site, and to protect GEMALTO from fraud or other inappropriate conduct. 

## Passive Information Collection 

The Site may “passively” collect certain kinds of Personal Information during your visit, including through the use of:

**Cookies** : “Cookies” are small text files sent from a Site to the hard drive of a user's computer to store bits of information related to that user. Cookies can store information about users, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, and passwords needed to access the special areas on the Site. We use cookies for the purpose of keeping track of the products and services you request, to assist with the downloading of documents and other materials from the Site, to create a more personalized experience on our Site, for standard Site traffic analysis, and to improve our Site content and display. If you choose to register or create a user profile, we will use cookies to store the Personal Information in your profile. You may configure your Internet browser, using the “help” function, to be notified when a cookie is sent (giving you the option to decide whether to accept it or not), and to reject cookies or remove cookies. However, if you reject or remove cookies, you might not be able to access certain pages or use important functions on the Site, including downloading documents and establishing a user profile.

**Other Passive Site Tracking**. This Site also uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files to identify server problems, to improve site content, and compile aggregated statistics about Site usage and click-stream data. We also use Web beacons to help personalize your experience and perform standard Site traffic analysis in a manner similar to how we use cookies. GEMALTO also reserves the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques related to the use of the Site, although we will do so subject to and in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. 

## Use, Disclosure and Transfer of Information

We never sell Personal Information. We use, disclose, transfer and otherwise process Personal Information in several ways. If you register or you create a user profile, we will store your Personal Information as requested to manage your profile. Personal Information obtained from registration forms is used to send requested product information and promotional materials. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information or you do not want to receive product information or promotional materials, you may contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy and ask us to delete the Personal Information in your profile. We may also disclose and transfer Personal Information to GEMALTO partners or resellers who can provide you with further information about GEMALTO’s products or services. 

We may also disclose and transfer Personal Information to IT providers, fulfillment houses, subcontractors managing e-mails, statistics, delivery of required information, services or products and other subcontractors that assist with the operation of the Site and/or the associated business transactions, which may be located within your home jurisdiction or elsewhere, including countries which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to the country in which you are located. All such parties will be required to keep Personal Information secure and only process it in accordance with our instructions.

We may also disclose and transfer Personal Information, subject to the requirements of applicable law, where necessary or appropriate to protect the security of the Site, to protect any member of the GEMALTO group of companies or others against liability, and/or in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business.

## Additional Communications

Persons who submit Personal Information on the Site will be added to our internal mailing list and may be provided with product information from GEMALTO via email, telemarketing, fax, SMS, and postal mail, where permitted by applicable law. If you do not wish to receive such information, please unsubscribe as described in the individual communication, or contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will remove your name from our subscriber list within ten (10) business days. 

## Data Security

Pursuant to applicable regulations, we maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. Unfortunately, no information security system can be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the Personal Information against any possible loss or unauthorized access. 

## Access and Correction of Personal Information

If you wish to access or update the Personal Information you submit through this Site, or to make any inquiries, please contact us as described below in the section “Contact”. In addition, GEMALTO provides individuals with access to their Personal Information as appropriate under applicable data protection and privacy laws. To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to you Personal Information. 

## International Transfers

GEMALTO hosts this Site on our servers in France. Because GEMALTO consists of a global group of companies, any Personal Information that you submit to the Site may be shared with our affiliates in any other location as appropriate for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Such jurisdictions might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your home country. Your use of the Site or submission of any Personal Information will therefore constitute your consent to these transfers.

## Links to Other Internet Sites

The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this Site and other specified activities only. Other websites hosted by third parties may have different practices. If you link to or otherwise visit any other websites managed by third parties, please review the privacy policies posted at those websites. GEMALTO has no control over those websites and is not responsible or liable for the policies and practices followed by third parties.

## Revisions to this Privacy Policy 

GEMALTO reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement from time to time in our discretion. Please check this Privacy Policy frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via the Site. All revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site via a link from the home page. In the event that we change a significant or material term in this Privacy Policy, we will notify affected visitors by revising the link on the home page to read "Revised Privacy Policy."
