**Customers Say it Best!**

  * "Dear GemSelect, I just received the turquoise I ordered, and I am totally impressed with the stones that I obtained from your company. This was also my first Internet purchase, and you have made my first online transaction a memorable one, thank you!"  
 **\--MY, MALAYSIA (January 2012)**
  * "Hello, thank you so much for the beautiful topaz, it arrived yesterday. "  
 **\--KD, Oregon, USA (July 2010)**
  * "Dear GemSelect, thank you for your concern. I contacted Fedex yesterday and this morning they delivered the package. I received all the items [andalusite, opal, amber and fire opal]. I look forward to doing further business with you. Regards, "  
 **\--PSO, Pennsylvania, USA (September 2010)**
  * "I was very appreciative of the wonderful quality of my rainbow moonstone that I purchased from you during my very first order. My jeweler assured me that your company was very good to work with for loose stones. Not only did I find the service very good, it was excellent, beyond my expectations: very professional, efficient, yet caring. It was a little scary to do this kind of business over the internet, but I was not disappointed at all. It will be easy to place my confidence in you to order again in the future .. your company does a great job in satisfying its customers, large or small."  
 **\--LB, Minnesota, USA (March 2011)**
