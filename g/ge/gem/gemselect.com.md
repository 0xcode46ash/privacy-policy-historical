**Customer Reviews**

seller sent me jewels i purchased . i was quite satisfied with seller and,with their service. i would recommend this seller to anyone interested in obtaining jewels, from a party you can trust to send you what you purchased. moreover this seller also provides you with information on just about any jewels that one would seek-and best of all,"its free. 

GemSelect has a wonderful selection of quality gemstones. They have a very easy to follow index of types of gems and an interesting and informative profile on each. This is my number one "go to" site for high quality gems. There is a fantastic selection, and information on each type of stone. I would not hesitate to recommend this site.

Good service, people were very helpful and helped me to obtain the full report from lab, though it was quite expensive. Overall, I am very happy with my buying experience.

We found a gorgeous black opal in the size and shape we wanted, at a very reasonable price. Can hardly wait to see the stone "up close and personal". Very good buying experience!
