**GEMM's Privacy Policy**

* * *

We recognize that ensuring the privacy of our buyers and sellers online is crucial to the GEMM experience and we want to assure our users that we are committed to protecting your privacy online.

Because we serve as a link between GEMM buyers and sellers, we need to ask each user for some personal information before our users can buy or sell items listed in GEMM. We also use some of the information to help us understand how the site is used so that we can customize our content to your tastes and preferences.

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our Web site. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.

  
**What information do we collect?**

When you place an order on GEMM, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing and shipping address, credit card number, and expiration date. This information allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. GEMM may use the information, on occasion, to notify our visitors about updates to our site, and certain programs that become available to our customers. This information is also available to our sellers so that they can process orders on their own behalf. Sellers registered with GEMM have agreed to abide by the terms of GEMM`s privacy policy and will be immediately removed from GEMM should they fail to do so.

  
**Will GEMM disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

GEMM does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. GEMM may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information. GEMM may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of GEMM, our users, or others.

  
**What are "cookies" and how do we use them?**

A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website stores on your computer to allow it to distinguish it from others. It''s used in conjunction with data stored on the GEMM server. It''s needed by GEMM to preserve the continuity of your session so that you can for instance place & keep items in a shopping cart without having to log in for each item. Cookies are also used by GEMM to know which affiliate to reward for introducing you to us. Cookies also might be used to allow you or the GEMM system to customize the content to your personal preferences. 

GEMM uses cookie information only for the above purposes. It does not share cookie information with other websites or businesses. In other words, the GEMM cookie can''t be used by any other company to build a larger scale profile of your browsing & buying habits. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. You can still search for music in GEMM with cookies turned off, but features such as the [Shopping Cart](https://www.gemm.com/cart.pl?&) and [My Account](https://www.gemm.com/c/ordertrack/o2_main_menu.pl?type=customer&) may not save your session data if cookies are disabled.

  
**Your consent**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by GEMM as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

  
**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy. If we do so, we will post those changes on this page so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we share the information with others.
