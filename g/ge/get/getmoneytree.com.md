We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following statement to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our web site. If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by phone or email. 

## Gathering of Information 

### Voluntary Submission 

We do not collect personally identifying information about any individual web site user except when knowingly provided by such individual. For example, we may ask you for information when you register for a contest or survey or to receive a newsletter. You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most our web site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a data file that certain web sites write to your computer’s hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. We use cookies solely to enable enhanced features for our web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user. 

Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.   
Browser Level Information 

Our web servers automatically collect information about a site user’s IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from the user’s browser (information provided by every user’s browser). This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our web site. This information is automatically logged by most web sites. 

##  Use of Information

Our primary goal in collecting user information is to provide financial services directly to you and to enhance your experience on our web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our calculators, forms and electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future promotions based on your interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.

We do not share your identifying or financial information with any 3rd parties without your prior knowledge and consent. These 3rd parties include credit bureaus, lenders, and other financial institutions that may assist with your financial needs.

We may disclose information about our users when we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure is required by law. 

Please be aware that our sponsors, advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those parties and web sites linked to ours are not covered by this privacy statement. Our users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. 

### Kids under 13

Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

### E-Mail 

We respect the privacy of our readers and shall not disclose, distribute or rent the e-mail address of subscriber newsletter list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. 

## How to Contact Us
