Like most websites today, our web servers keep log ﬁles that record data each time a device accesses those servers and those log ﬁles contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. If the survey taker arrives on our website, we record information about the source that referred the survey taker to us.

The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include cookies. A cookie is a small ﬁle placed on the survey taker’s computer or smartphone. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not require permanent cookies. The survey taker can choose to refuse or disable cookies from their browser or the settings on their smartphone but this may adversely impact the survey taker’s ability to use our Services.

Our Services may contain small electronic ﬁles known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content on our Services and verifying system and server integrity).

### How We Use Survey Taker Information

Survey responses are owned and managed by the survey creator. To understand how survey creators will use survey responses, survey takers would need to contact the survey creator directly.

We only use information that we collect about or from survey takers, including any personal information, to:

  * Improve our Services and resolve technical issues.

### When Survey Taker Information is Shared or Disclosed

Survey responses are disclosed to the survey creator and, as mentioned above, such responses are owned and managed by the survey creator. 

We host surveys but the survey creators control how surveys are sent out and what is done with the information received. Survey takers should contact the survey creator to understand what will be done with survey responses and whether responses are received anonymously or whether the survey was sent out in a manner that allows the survey creator to link the response with an email address. 

In the following limited situations, we may disclose survey taker information to someone other than the survey creator:

  * To our contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are obligated to keep personal information conﬁdential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
