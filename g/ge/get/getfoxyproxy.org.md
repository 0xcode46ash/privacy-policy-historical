Last Updated: January 2016

## Summary Without the Legalese!

Our privacy policy is closely aligned with our philosophy on free speech, free press, and the right to anonymity.

  1. We don't log your activity.
  2. We don't track you in any way.
  3. We don't advertise.
  4. If you use one of our free products or services, we don't collect any information about you.
  5. If you use our [support system](https://support.getfoxyproxy.org/) or [community forums](http://forums.getfoxyproxy.org/), those systems ask for an email address in order to notify you of replies. You are encouraged to use a disposable email address for this purpose, although we will never share or sell that address, give it to a 3rd party unless required by law, nor send any emails to it except reply notifications.
  6. If you use one of our [paid services](https://web.archive.org/order/), we collect the minimum information possible in order only to bill you. For example, we cannot bill a credit card without a name. If we did collect billing information from you, that information (except your email address) is not stored by us. It is stored by our payment provider, [Recurly](https://recurly.com/). Their privacy policy is [here](https://recurly.com/legal/privacy/).
  7. If you use one of our [paid services](https://web.archive.org/order/), we ask for an email address. You are encouraged to use an anonymous email address. We use this email address only to provide you with account information, and to alert you of changes to your account information.
  8. If we did collect minimal billing information from you during checkout, we will never share or sell it. We will never give it to a 3rd party unless required by law. We will never market to you directly unless you expressly opt-in when making a purchase or when setting the marketing preference in the [control panel](https://web.archive.org/panel/).
  9. Automatic renewal of service will only occur if you expressly opt-in when making a purchase or when setting the automatic-renewal preference in the [control panel](https://web.archive.org/panel/).
