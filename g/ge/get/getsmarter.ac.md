#### 3\. Cookies and similar technologies

A cookie is a small piece of code that is installed in your web browser by a website that you visit. They help the website to remember information about your visit, and assist to make the website, and advertisements that you encounter while browsing, more relevant to you. We've provided some further detail on cookies below to try and clarify how and why we use them.

 **(ii) How can I manage the installation of cookies?**

Through your browser preferences, it is also possible to delete cookies installed in the past.

#### 4\. Use of Non-Personal Data

We use your non-personal data for purposes like product improvement, internal reporting, learning analytics, performing statistical analyses of collective behaviour of our users, measuring demographics and interests, and for other legitimate business purposes. We will take all reasonable steps to properly de-identify all information that is stored and analysed as non-personal data. This non-personal data may also be shared with the current and future universities partnering on course development and/or delivery ("knowledge partners"), and other partners and service providers (since there is no prejudice to our users from the disclosure of this non-personal information).

#### 5\. Use of Personal Data

Except as set out in this Policy or specifically agreed by you, we won't disclose your personal data that we receive through the Websites. In general we will always aim to de-identify the information that we store (as non-personal information), but some information will need to still be attached to your name or email address (as personal information), for reasons listed below, and with the aim of supporting personalised student learning journeys. We work hard to ensure that access to student information doesn't disadvantage or prejudice our students.

The ways in which (and the purposes for which) we use personal data are described in further detail below:

  * Verifying student identity.
  * Contacting you for the purpose of:
    * marketing,
    * advising you on course information,

    * to government authorities in response to court orders, subpoenas or other legal processes, to establish or exercise a legal right, defend a claim, or as otherwise required by law;
    * to investigate, prevent or take action in relation to any suspected illegal activities, or to protect our own rights and the rights of our knowledge partners;
    * to acquirers, assignees or other successor entities in connection with a sale, merger or reorganisation of all or substantially all of our equity, business or assets;
    * to a student's employer, in the event that the employer is paying for the student's course, and the student has consented to the disclosure.

    * for which we receive your consent,
    * that is in the public interest,

#### 7\. Information Security

 **(i) Methods of processing**

We undertake to process your personal data in a reasonable manner and take appropriate, reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorised destruction of your personal data. All data processing shall be carried out by employees, consultants or third party service providers using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following standard organizational procedures and modes.

In some cases, personal and non-personal data may be accessible to certain types of persons involved with the operation of the Websites (administration, sales, marketing, finance, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, by us as data processers.

 **(ii) Place**

All data collected through our Websites is managed and processed primarily at our various operating offices, and in any other place where the parties involved with the processing are located. For further information on our servers and places where we process data, please contact us.

Due to the fact that we have students all over the world, and hosting services have become more 'cloud-based' and international in recent years, we may send and store your personal data outside of the country in which you reside, and there will therefore be some cross-border transfer of this personal data. We are nevertheless committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred, in accordance with this Policy and the data privacy requirements in the United Kingdom.

 **(iii) Retention time**

All Personal Data will only be kept for the time necessary considering the purpose for which it was collected or to provide the service requested by you – we won't keep Personal Data for an excessive period of time, and won't keep Personal Data after we no longer have any valid use for it. You may also request that we suspend or remove your personal data from our system.

All non-personal data and de-personalised data will be retained for as long as it is useful and necessary, in light of the fact that the maintenance of this data would not be prejudicial to individual users in the event of a security breach.

#### 8\. Additional Information
