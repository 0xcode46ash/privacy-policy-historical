# GetPaidToTry | Privacy Policy

**Information Collected:**

The information collected by GetPaidToTry is used to better serve you. We collect your name and address to provide payment to you. Demographical information about you, including birth date, gender, marital status, and interests are collected to send you paid emails corresponding to your information. Your personal information is physically given to advertisers who pay for mailings when you select co-registration boxes (ads for separate sites) on our signup form or on a page in our registration path. The information provided to these advertisers varies based on advertising campaign requirements. 

**Means of Collection:**

At this time, the only way to become a member of GetPaidToTry is by filling out our signup form. Members will not be acquired through purchases, other companies, or mergers. However, GetPaidToTry reserves the right to purchase email addresses and market offers to these individuals as a separate function of our site. These individuals are not considered GetPaidToTry members, and are not paid to receive these email promotions.

**Use of Information:**

The information you provide us serves two purposes. One of these purposes is for GetPaidToTry to contact you regarding updates to our program and other essential contacts between the company and its members. The other purpose is to match you with paying advertisers using the demographic information you provide upon signup. 

**Posting of Personal Information:**

We have a ZERO Tolerance against cheating! Any member deemed to be cheating our program, depending on the seriousness of the fraud involved, automatically forfeits their coverage under our Privacy Policy. We hereby claim the right to post any and all information provided by any Member that has attempted to fraud our company. We believe this will make members seriously consider their actions before attempting to cheat. This action is reserved for serious offenses only. We will not post every cheating offense on this page, just the ones we deem to be malicous.

**Minimum Required Age:**

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Members must be at least 13 years old to participate in our program. 

**Information from Third Parties:**

We may collect your information when you provide it to a third party, and we subsequently purchase, license or lawfully acquire the information from that party. The information that we collect may include but is not limited to your name, address, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, employment status, person and online interests, and other information that you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring data from outside sources, we seek assurances that the party has the right to transfer the information to us, that the data was not improperly obtained, and that we have the right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose information is provided to us. 

When you register with GetPaidToTry.com and you leave the box checked stating "By checking this box, you agree to receive email from GetPaidToTry-Offers.com" - you explicitly authorize us to share your information with Datran Media to contact you via email. 

**Subject to Change:**

By registering as a member at GetPaidToTry.com, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change from time to time, as our company grows and our plans change. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without notification to our Members; however, if any major updates take place, we will post this information with a pertinent link on our site. 

It is the responsibility of our members to review this policy periodically to ensure that they are aware of our rules and regulations so users are aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. In the event that a change is made after user registration the user will be notified via e-mail and be given the opportunity to opt-out prior to those changes going into effect.   
This policy will be available on this page for members to read.
