# GetUp! Privacy Policy

GetUp collects personal information principally to allow us to send you opportunities to get up and participate in our campaigns. You can ask to stop receiving these emails or change your details at any time by using the link at the bottom of each email or by sending an email to: privacy@getup.org.au.

In addition, your information may be used to identify your location (eg electorate, state) and provide targeted and relevant opportunities for you to be part of our activities.

We will also collect personal information for security and verification reasons when accepting donations.

**What does GetUp do with the information?**

GetUp will not provide your personal information to any other organisation except where necessary eg to verify credit card transactions or as required by law.

We won't sell, trade or exchange your information without your permission.

When you send an email through the site, such as to a newspaper or member of Parliament, the email will include your email address and full name. When you sign a petition, we will publish your name, town and state, but not your email or physical address.

We'll make all reasonable efforts to store your information safely and securely. When you donate online using credit card facilities, that information is encrypted before being sent using SSL certificates.

**For more information...**

If you would like more information on privacy at GetUp, [contact us by email](http://www.getup.org.au/about/contact/), or on 02 9264 4037.
