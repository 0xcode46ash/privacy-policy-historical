We consider your privacy to be very important. All information provided by you will be kept strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party without your permission.

 **Anti-Spam Policy**  
Any eMail addresses supplied by clients of select agencies will not be sold to third parties. If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

 **Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and postal address), and demographic information (such as postal code, age, gender, etc).

 **Log Files & Visitor Analysis**  
In an endeavor to maintain a superior service for clients, we use Site Meter to analyze traffic to this website. Site Meter does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services Site Meter does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Site Meter only collects aggregate data.

 **Sharing**  
Where partnerships with other companies are formed, we will share aggregated demographic information with them. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

Where we use an outside shipping company to ship orders or use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

 **External Links**  
This site, our eMails, and other electronic publications contain links to other sites. Our company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

 **Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.

Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
