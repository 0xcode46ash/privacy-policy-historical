## The data we collect 

### The information collected when you register with us is generally used to communicate with you and improve our services where possible, and specifically, to process payments or enable third parties to carry out technical or commercial supporting functions.

### In addition to personal data such as name, e-mail address, delivery address, billing address, credit or debit card number and expiry date, we also analyse data about participants in order to provide a safe shopping environment for all users. Examples of the data we may collect and analyse include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, login, password, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, your operating system and platform, the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), your clickstream to, through and from our website (including date and time), cookie number, products you viewed or searched for, your purchase history, personal preferences and any phone number recorded or used to call our customer services number. In using our website you accept that your personal data may be used for such purposes.

### We will not sell, distribute or disclose information about you or your personal usage of our website without your consent or unless required or permitted to do so by law. If you subscribe to our mailing lists for new release and other information, we may also ask you to answer various general questions about yourself. You may be asked to specify the areas in which you are interested so that we can tailor the information which we send to you to cover the topics and merchandise which we believe you might be interested in. By subscribing to our mailing lists, you accept that your personal data may be used for such purposes. You also accept that we may from time to time share this information with other group companies. They will not use this information for any purpose other than those listed here and for promotion of other group company brands.

### Please note that we do provide links to other sites, which are not governed by this Privacy Policy and you should view the respective privacy policies of those sites for further information.

### In addition to the information which you supply to us, information and data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files our website can use to recognise repeat users and allow us to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve our website for you. For example, cookies will tell us whether you viewed our website with sound or with text on your last visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors to our website. You can configure your internet browser to accept or reject certain cookies or inform you when a cookie is saved.

### We do not cross the information recorded in the cookies with the personal information collected at the time of your registration on our website or with your online activity.

### Some of our business partners may themselves use cookies on their own websites. We have no access or control of these cookies, therefore we cannot accept liability for any malfunctioning of your PC or its installed web browser as a result of your access to any of the websites linked to from our website.

### We may monitor customer traffic patterns, website usage and related information in order to optimise your use of the website and we may give aggregated statistics to a reputable third party, but these statistics will include no information personally identifying you.

### We may also use the information we gather to notify you about important functionality changes and alterations to the website, or offers of products, services or information that might be of particular interest to you. By submitting your information and ticking the requisite boxes on any order form or when subscribing to the services available on our website, you expressly consent to such use and transfer, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## We comply with, and are registered under, the Data Protection laws in the United Kingdom. We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized access to and use of your personal data.

## We have business and technical partners with whom we share data to handle orders, process credit and debit card payments and provide a range of services, including for fraud protection purposes. They are bound by Data Protection covenants and must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Laws of the United Kingdom.

## From time to time we may need to transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (namely the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) in order to deal with your requirements in a more efficient manner. In agreeing with the Privacy Policy, you specifically consent to us transferring your data outside the EEA.

## In case any fraudulent activity is detected on the website, or, without limitation, in connection with the breach of intellectual property rights through the use of the website, we may release personal information in order to comply with any applicable law or regulation, or assert our rights as well as those of our business partners.

## We always aim to improve the services we offer. As a result we occasionally canvass our customers using surveys or inform you of upcoming promotions or other relevant information, by means of newsletters, telephone, emails or SMS (text message) provided that you have given prior and express consent.

## Your participation on our website may mean that we occasionally contact you with the opportunity to enter competitions. Participation in surveys and competitions and subscription to newsletters is voluntary, and you are under no obligation to reply to any survey or invitation to a competition you might receive from us. Should you choose to sign up to these surveys or newsletters, or to enter a competition, we will treat the information you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## If you do not wish to receive any mailings or invitations to enter competitions, email unsubscribe@getthelabel.com with your email address, name and address details.

## We may from time to time operate an "Email a friend" service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for customers to recommend our website and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend’s name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular offer, or to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. We will not use your friend’s details for any other purpose.

## If you use this facility to email a friend and provide us with his/her name and e-mail address, we reasonably assume (and you warrant) that you have obtained your friend’s prior consent in order for us to process his/her data. You supply any such information freely and voluntarily, and at your sole liability and responsibility.
