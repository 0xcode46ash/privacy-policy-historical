# Privacy Policy - Get Revising

This is about protecting the information you give us. It is standard for a site of this type. The principles are the key thing.

**Our principles**  
We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior consent. We have also established the following principles:  
1\. We will respect your e-mail privacy, and will send you unsolicited mail from getrevising.co.uk only if you have agreed to this.  
2\. We will not pass on any individual user details (including your e-mail address) unless we have your prior consent.  
3\. Otherwise, we will only share aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers.

  
1) Information Collected

(a) It is necessary for getrevising.co.uk to collect your personal information for the purposes of registering you as a user of the website [www.getrevising.co.uk](http://www.getrevising.co.uk/) (the "Site"). Your responses also help us to provide as complete a service as possible for you by ensuring that the Site and any appropriate advertising or sponsorship space that we sell reflects your needs and requirements.  
(b) If your contact details change please amend details in your control panel.  
(c) Getrevising.co.uk collects data listing which of its pages are most frequently visited and by which type of users.

2) Data Protection and Disclosure  
(a) GetRevising maintains registrations and takes all reasonable endeavours to comply with all requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and any regulation created under it.  
(b) GetRevising will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except with your permission or under special circumstances such as when it believes in good faith that the law requires disclosure.  
  
3) Further Use of Information  
(a) GetRevising may occasionally send you communications about products and services that it feels may be of interest to you unless you indicate that you are not interested in receiving such offers or information from us.  
(b) GetRevising does not sell, trade or rent user information to others unless you have given us permission. With your permission GetRevising will only share your information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties.  
(c) GetRevising will not pass on your personal information unless you have given your prior consent. Otherwise, GetRevising will only share aggregate statistics about sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers, but these statistics will not include any personally identifiable information.

4) Cookies  
In addition to the information which you supply when you register with us, information and data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files a web site can use to recognise repeat users and allow GetRevising to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the Site. Cookies make it possible for GetRevising to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time you access the Site. Using cookies also means that accessing the Site is more convenient for you as you do not need to remember your username and password each time you enter the Site.  
  
5) GetRevising's Security Policy  
(a) No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, GetRevising cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to GetRevising and you do so at your own risk.  
(b) Following transmission, GetRevising will make best efforts to ensure the security of the information on its systems.

At GetRevising.co.uk we collect information about our users for two main reasons:

1\. To help us continually improve the service we offer.  
2\. To use the details of our users to sell appropriate advertising or sponsorship space on the site, and so continue to keep getrevising.co.uk free for all our users.
