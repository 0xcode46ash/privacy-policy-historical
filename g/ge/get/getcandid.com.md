## Data Collection and Publishing

This Site collects no more data about you than most other websites. The information that the user introduces in his public gallery, as well as his public web albums are published, and except in very limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this Site. Please keep this information in mind when deciding whether to upload any content.

## Personally Identifiable Information

When creating a profile or uploading pictures, a name and an email address will be required. Generally, the information CANDID collects helps us to communicate with you regarding content that you have submitted through the CANDID Services. For instance, we may use your email address to provide you with an email confirmation of your registration or to notify you of the status of the content you have submitted. Furthermore, our licensees whose sites you have submitted content to through the CANDID Services, may use your email address to communicate with you from time to time.

When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and Services, and for the Site's technical administration.

We will not share, rent or sell your personally-identifiable information with any entity, except as set forth in our Data Release Policy below.

## Cookies

We also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. CANDID may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and Services.

A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Services and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

## IP Address and Clickstream Data

Our server may collect the Internet Protocol address, or IP Address number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the Web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with your personal information.

Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).

## Clear GIFs

We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your personal information.

## Data Release Policy

Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following circumstances:

  * To our licensees whose sites you have submitted content to.
  * As required by law.
  * To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
  * When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.
  * For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user's Internet Service Provider.
  * If necessary to defend against legal claims.
  * When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this Site



## Service Providers

We may use third party partners to help operate the Site and deliver our features and Services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or Services for or through this Site or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).

## No Selling of Information

We will not sell, lease or give your personally identifiable information collected via this site (such as your email address) to third parties except as otherwise explicitly stated in this Policy and the Terms of Use.

## Securing Your Information

CANDID is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. Although we use security measures to help protect your personally identifiable information against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control.

When you use some our Site or Services, or post on a Candid forum or social networking service, the personally identifiable information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these instances.

If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

## Phishing

If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with CANDID, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at [admin@getcandid.com](mailto:admin@getcandid.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy)

## Third Party Links

Our Site or Services may contain links to third party websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

## Our Policy Towards Minors

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 unless they have obtained parental or guardian consent. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 18 without such consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [admin@getcandid.com](mailto:admin@getcandid.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy)

This Privacy Policy is effective as of September 1st, 2013
