**How Does Gettington Share My Personal Information?  
**_Service Providers._ We share personal information with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card processing services, data storage services, and web hosting services) or that help us market our products and services (such as third-party email marketing companies). These third parties are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to take commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.

_With Our Marketing Partners_ . From time to time we may establish a business relationship with other third parties whom we believe trustworthy. These are known as our "Marketing Partners." In such cases, we may share and cross-reference information, including some personal information about you, so that our Marketing Partners can contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.

If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us. 

_Compliance With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others._ We may disclose personal information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce or apply our online terms of use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

**Your Choices**  
_In General._ We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. In most cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal information. We will also include an "opt-out" link in newsletter or promotional email we send you so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future.

We will respond to reasonable requests within a reasonable time and, in any event, within the time period required by law. 

Even if you ask us not to share or use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, we may still use your personal information in connection with the proper administration and management of your Gettington Credit Account.

**Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies by Third Parties  
**_Marketing Consultants._ Our marketing consultants may use Web beacons, cookies and other Web technologies to collect information about visitors to this Site. For example, our consultants may count how many visitors access this Site, what links they use, and what pages they view. They may also track which Web sites and advertisements refer traffic to this Site and the URLs of the sites to which this Site refer traffic (that is, the Web sites on which our visitors land when they leave this Site). Our consultants use this information to compile statistics and prepare reports that provide the feedback and analysis we need to understand the needs and interests of our visitors, improve the content, functionality and usability of this Site, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing efforts.

_Advertising Companies._ We use third-party advertising companies to manage our online advertising campaigns. These advertising companies use cookies and other Web technologies to target and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements. For example, these advertising companies place Web beacons on their clients’ Web sites, including this Site. When you visit these Web sites, the Web beacon "tags" your computer with a "cookie". The information stored on the cookie does not identify you personally and is not combined with any information that identifies you personally, but it does permit our advertising companies to recognize your computer when you access one of their clients’ sites. These advertising companies use the information they collect about your use of their clients’ Web sites to customize the advertisements you see when you visit their clients’ sites. Our advertising companies’ use of cookies and other web technologies is covered by their privacy policies, not by this Online Privacy Statement. If you do not wish to receive our advertising companies’ cookies, you may "opt-out" by using the following link and clicking the "SELECT ALL" button on the opening page: [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)
