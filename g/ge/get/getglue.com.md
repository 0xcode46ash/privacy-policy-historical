# GetGlue: Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 28, 2010

The GetGlue network is made available by AdaptiveBlue, Inc., a Delaware corporation. GetGlue respects your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information, such as your name, email address and mailing address. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how your personal information is collected and used by us. Contact us with any questions you may have by emailing [support@getglue.com](mailto:support@getglue.com). We’re always happy to hear from you.

## How GetGlue Works

The GetGlue website and mobile apps enable you to “check in” to your entertainment and get entertainment recommendations based on your likes, what your friends like and what’s popular now. GetGlue works by recognizing books, music, movies, wine, restaurants, and other entertainment on GetGlue.com and on popular pages around the web. You rate your favorites to create a personal taste profile. The GetGlue software saves the items that you check-in to and the things you like, and recommends to you other things that you may be interested in. You can share your opinion and leave a comment, posting information to be displayed publicly under your user name. You can get free stickers and, from time to time, additional offers and rewards. Additionally, you can choose to add the GetGlue app to your web browser and it will appear automatically on certain popular sites around the web.

By using GetGlue you build a library of your entertainment taste preferences. That library is part of GetGlue’s service. To provide you this service, GetGlue needs to keep track of what you checkin to and what items you like. By its nature, the GetGlue service needs to make use of information about you. Any use we make of your information is subject to the terms of this privacy policy. If you use GetGlue, you agree to allow us to use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You are in control of what information about yourself and your network activities you share with us and with other GetGlue users. Visit <http://getglue.com/settings> to configure your account settings to reflect your privacy preferences.

## What information does GetGlue collect and how?

Personal information collected by GetGlue is information voluntarily provided to us by you when you create your account or change your account information. Currently, information that we save about you includes your display name, your email address, and your user id. In addition, if you request free stickers or other rewards to be physically mailed to you, GetGlue will ask you for your mailing address. This mailing address is only used to mail you the stickers or other rewards and is not used for any other purpose. Once the particular stickers or other rewards are sent to you, we no longer save your mailing address.

GetGlue stores your entertainment check ins, likes, dislikes and comments that you provide us with. In addition, if you add GetGlue to your browser, it will by default store the books, movies, music, shows, games and topics you visit around the web on popular sites. By visiting <http://getglue.com/settings>, you can set your account to hide your visits so that things you have checked out won’t be shown on your profile. When you unsubscribe from the GetGlue service, all data that we have saved about you is deleted.

The GetGlue website and widgets (<http://getglue.com/widgets>) use cookies. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser, for the purpose of enhancing your visit to the website. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. We use cookies to personalize your site visit, securely store your ID and password, and identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of other information that you voluntarily provide. You can set your computer settings to alert you when a cookie is being placed. You may also clear all cookies saved to your computer by using the relevant selection in your internet browser.

## How GetGlue uses your personal information

Information collected about your Internet usage, your “likes” and “dislikes”, and information you post, is displayed to the public, together with your chosen user name, according to the user account settings selected by you when you join GetGlue or update your account. Your profile by default is visible on the GetGlue.com website and mobile apps. You can change this by visiting <http://getglue.com/settings>.

We will not disclose your personal information to others without your express permission, or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. GetGlue does not supplement the personal information provided by you with information collected from other sources.

The only way for third party applications or services to access your information is by you giving them explicit permission to do so. When you give permission to share your information with other websites (eg., when you agree to a pop up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information), GetGlue uses standard OAuth (open authorization) technology to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us (eg., your checkins and likes) without sharing your security credentials. You only authenticate on our site. The only way a third party is permitted to access your info is by using standard OAuth protocol.

We will also use your personal information to contact you from time to time by email: regarding updates to our policies and to GetGlue software; to send you our weekly digest or other information that we feel may be of interest to you; or to provide you stickers or other rewards or information about how to obtain them. The GetGlue service includes a weekly digest of new activity. You may elect to turn off the digest by visiting <http://getglue.com/settings>. You may choose to unsubscribe from our emails by using the “unsubscribe” link on the bottom of the email.

We also use your mailing address to mail you physical stickers or other rewards if you explicitly request that. Your mailing address is not stored longer than necessary to mail you the item in connection with which the mailing address was provided.

Your information will be accessed by GetGlue employees as necessary to provide customer support and troubleshoot problems.

We may also release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements, or to protect the rights of AdaptiveBlue or others. Your personal information is, of course, subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders.

Information collected about you is protected in several ways.

When you provide us with your email, mailing address or other personal information, these are stored in our secure database in encrypted format. When your personal information is sent between the web browser and the server, it is also encrypted using modern encryption standards in order prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information while it is being transferred.

Your credentials are never shared with any GetGlue partners; you only authenticate on the GetGlue site or apps.
