**2\. Cookies policy**

To make our websites function properly, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile devices, known as cookies. A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a websites server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or whats in your shopping basket. 

Most big websites or internet service providers do this in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a session cookie) or for repeat visits (using a persistent cookie). Cookies help the site remember your settings  language, font size and other preferences for how you want to view the site on your computer or mobile devices - so you dont have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to us. If a website doesnt use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site  for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it wont recognize you and it wont be able to keep you logged in. 

Our cookies are not used to identify you personally. Theyre just there to make the site work better for you. You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish  for details, see AboutCookies.org. You can delete all the cookies already on your computer and you can set most browsers to block them being placed. But if you do this, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our websites. 

Instructions on how to change your browser settings are available at the following links:
