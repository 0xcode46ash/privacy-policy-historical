  * We recognise your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you may share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number).   
We do track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyse this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. 
  * Our Web pages utilise "cookies" so that we can better serve you with more tailored information when you return to our site. "Cookies" are used to enhance your interactive experience and generally improve our service to you. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. We recommend that you accept cookies as they are completely harmless. 
  * We store information you supply in our free e-mail services. 
  * We protect subscriber information from outside parties by storing it in a fully-secured database. 
  * You may update personal information at any time by using the subscriber functions. 
  * We will never release your name, street address, or e-mail address without your consent. 
  * In all cases, the only information we will ever disclose to third parties (e.g.: advertisers and partners) is aggregate information about our users.
