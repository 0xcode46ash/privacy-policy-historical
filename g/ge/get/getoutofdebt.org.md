# Myvesta.org: About Us: Privacy Policy

Myvesta.org has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. 

## IP Information

The Myvesta.org Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives Myvesta.org an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a users session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. On our secure sites we do provide a deeper level of tracking for abuse protection purposes. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Myvesta.org uses cookies in only two instancesâ€”when you travel through the site:

**Registration:** when you register for the Myvesta.org chat room or forum, Myvesta.org may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.

We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies also enable you to enter Myvesta.org's chat room or forum as a member without having to log on each time. 

##  Registration Information

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information. The contact information is used to contact the visitor to complete information requests and if the email address is provided, added to our opt-in email notification list. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the delete/deactivate section below). 

## Order Form Information

Our site uses an order form for visitors to purchase, products, and services. This secure order form is hosted by an outside firm to process orders. We have instructed the vendor to collect purchasers' contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to complete orders. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the delete/deactivate section below). The vendor is under contract to not disclose any confidential information to any third party.

Financial information that is collected is used to process the order for products and services. 

## Banners
