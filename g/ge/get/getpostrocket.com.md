Information Collection and Use

PostRocket is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. PostRocket collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

Web Site Registration

In order to use some features of this Web site, users must first complete the registration form. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (name and e-mail address) and/or via Facebook login functionality. This information is used to contact users about the topics on our site for which they have expressed interest and to enable users to retrieve lost passwords. We require users to connect their PostRocket account with their Facebook accounts in order for us to use the information and data to have PostRocket functioning the way it is intended.

Cookies

PostRocket uses cookies to remember if users have logged in while on our site. This allows web site users to avoid logging in more than once, thereby saving time. Users have the option of disabling or not accepting cookies by changing the preferences on their browsers*. If users opt to disable cookies, they will still be able to use our Web site. However, they will not be able to use some functionality.

Web Statistics

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use for reporting and sponsorship purposes. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Sharing

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners, sponsors, and donors. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We only share this information so that we can secure funding to continue providing this site free of charge.

Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that PostRocket does not claim any responsibility for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Security

PostRocket takes every precaution to protect our users’ information, and we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

Send This to a Friend

If users elect to use our “Send This to a Friend” function, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. PostRocket will automatically send friends an e-mail message inviting them to visit the site.

Updates

We may also send the user site and service announcement updates. Users are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements that contain important information about the service. We communicate with users to provide requested services and to discuss issues relating to their accounts via e-mail.

Choice/Opt-in

Our users are given the opportunity to “opt in” to newsletters and site update e-mail messages. To unsubscribe from mailings, please see your account settings page. To avoid receiving certain topic updates, the user can simply deselect the topics and select the “modify” button.

Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
