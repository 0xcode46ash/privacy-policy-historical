Most pages of our Web site contain a link to this privacy policy, which describes what information we collect and how we use it. By using the Getty's Web site or communicating with us by e-mail, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

**General Policy on Collection of Information**  
We only collect personally identifiable information if you knowingly provide it to us.

We may record your e-mail address if you e-mail us, submit an online form that contains your e-mail address, opt to receive e-mail notices of Getty programs, news, and events, or register for an online service such as Getty Bookmarks or the ArtsEdNet Talk discussion board.

We will never share your e-mail address with anyone.

Our Web server automatically records the IP addresses of visitors to our site. This information is used in aggregate form to helps us understand how visitors use the Getty online environment. The servers at this site also collect connection-related technical data. The data entries in these logs are used for server and network operation and maintenance and to help us understand general usage patterns.

Some pages on this site allow you to send free e-cards to a friend. E-cards are sent as links to a Getty.edu Web page. We do not save, use, or sell senders' or recipients' names or e-mail addresses.

**E-Newsletters**  
The Getty offers free electronic newsletters sent via e-mail.

To receive an e-newsletter by e-mail, you need to submit your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is stored on secure Getty servers and will not be shared with anyone.

You may stop receiving e-newsletters at any time. Follow the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of any newsletter.

**Getty Bookmarks**  
To use the Getty Bookmark feature, you need to create an online account. Your e-mail address is used to identify your account and the associated bookmarks. The e-mail address tied to your account is stored on secure Getty servers and will not be used for marketing purposes or shared with anyone. We may occasionally use your e-mail address for purposes related to administration of your online account, such as sending service notices or password reminders.

We use cookies to administer your online account(s). However, we do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information.

If you choose to e-mail Getty Bookmarks to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail containing your bookmarks, but we will not store his or her e-mail address or use it for any other purpose.

You may review or change the password(s) for your online account(s) at any time. Log in to Getty Bookmarks and click "Edit Profile" to choose a new password.

You may contact us at [bookmarks@getty.edu](mailto:bookmarks@getty.edu) to request that we remove your e-mail address from our database.

**Planning a School Visit**  
To request a school visit to the Getty, you must submit information about yourself, your school, and the nature of your visit request. This information is used to help us accommodate school visit requests as equitably as possible. The information is recorded and stored in a database by our Education Department and may be used to contact you. We periodically send information to schools and teachers to notify them of additions to our Web site and of new educational programs at the Getty.

To protect your privacy, do not send any message to the TeacherArtExchange listserv that contains personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, or phone number. Please be advised that your e-mail client may send your username to our list along with your e-mail address. If you wish to remain anonymous, please make sure your e-mail username is not your actual name.

You can [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/education/teacherartexchange/unsubscribe.html) from TeacherArtExchange at any time.
