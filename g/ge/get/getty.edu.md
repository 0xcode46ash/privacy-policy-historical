# Privacy Policy Statement (Getty About Us)

In order to improve the content of our Web sites, our web server automatically records the IP addresses of visitors to the sites so that we may collect information on how visitors use the Getty online environment. We will also record your email address for this same purpose if you email us. In addition, if you opt to receive occasional email notices of Getty programs, news, and events, we will also record your contact address.

The standard web, gopher, and ftp information servers at this site, like all other web, gopher, and ftp servers, create local log file entries containing connection related technical data, but no personally-identifiable information not provided explicitly by the user. Their data entries in these logs are used only for server and network operation and maintenance, and are not related to outside entities.

**Cookies**

A 'cookie' is a piece of data we store on your computer's hard drive. This data contains information about you that we will use to help make your visit to the Getty Web site easier. For example, one cookie we may store can remember what kind of video capability you have selected so you might not have to do that every time you watch a video. You do not have to accept any Getty cookies to enjoy and use the Getty Web site; if you reject all Getty cookies you will have to re-enter those preferences now and again that we would otherwise keep track of for you.

Getty cookies do not track your activity on this site.  
Getty cookies will not be disclosed to anyone else.  
Getty cookies are not linked to any information that could identify you personally.

**Getty Publications**

If you make an online purchase or request a catalog, we may also collect your email and/or your mailing address to contact you for marketing purposes. We may share the mailing addresses we collect with other reputable publishers to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. If you do not want to receive email from Getty Publications in the future, or do not want us to share your mailing address with other publishers, please let us know by writing us at:
