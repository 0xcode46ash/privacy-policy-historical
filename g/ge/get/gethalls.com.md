Your California Privacy Rights

For California Residents Only. We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the Mondelēz Global name, for their own direct marketing purposes.

Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

Our sites are intended for general audiences and Mondelēz Global does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 on our sites. We might permit a child to send us an e-mail. We will respond to or deliver these e-mails, but we do not store the names, e-mail addresses, or the e-mails themselves in our operational database. We do not maintain this information, nor do we share it with third parties (other than support service companies as described above).

Under federal law, websites directed to children under 13 are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to engage in the activity. We comply fully with this requirement.

Upon proper identification, any parent can review any personal information we have collected from their child, if we are still maintaining the information in our operational database. They may also request that the information be deleted from our database, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Online Team as described below.
