# Privacy Policy - Nymi

_Last Update: November 26, 2014_

Nymi Inc. and its divisions, affiliates and subsidiaries (hereinafter “Nymi”) respects the privacy and the integrity of any information that you provide in the use of our Web sites and services. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our users’ needs. As we update, expand and diversify our products and services, this Privacy Policy may evolve. Please check this Privacy Policy from time to time for updates by checking the date of the “Last Update” at the top of this document. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here. A link to our Privacy Policy will be provided at the bottom of each web page on our Web sites. You acknowledge and agree that your access of our Web sites and your use of our services following any posted changes to the Privacy Policy indicate your acceptance of such changes.

### Application of this policy

At Nymi, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users, which is why we do not sell or rent any personal information or personally identifiable information regarding our users to any third party. We hope this Privacy Policy will answer your questions regarding how we treat personal information gathered from visitors to our Web sites and users of our services.

### What is personal information

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, address, e-mail address, country of residence, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of our site and our services. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.

### Consent

You acknowledge and agree that by accessing our Web sites or using our services you fully understand, accept and voluntarily consent to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. It is always your choice whether or not you provide us with your personal information; however, a decision to withhold personal information may restrict or prevent us from providing you with a particular product or service. We will only collect, use, and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirement.

### Collection of personal information

In order to use certain features of our services you must first complete a registration process and establish an account (“Account”).  During registration for your Account you will be required to provide basic information such as your name, address and email address and establish a password. Nymi will retain this information and associate it with your Account.  In addition, to place an order for services, Nymi will require that you provide payment information such as credit card numbers and billing addresses and Nymi will also acquire your IP address.  Credit card information, including the card number, expiry date and security code, is securely collected by us and passed directly to payment processors over a secure socket layer (see the section entitled “Shopify” below). Upon successful transfer of credit card data, the information is erased permanently and not retained by Nymi in any form.

### Use of your personal information

You acknowledge that Nymi may use personal information that you voluntarily disclose to us to:

  1. Provide you with information about new products, services, newsletters, informative e-mails, and research on future product ideas or improvements;
  2. Assist us in creating or providing content that is relevant to you;
  3. Provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you and to improve your experience on our Web sites or with our services;
  4. Assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs;
  5. Allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select including but not limited to the Nymi Band product;
  6. Provide you with technical support;
  7. Help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you;
  8. Send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, and product/service order confirmations. Nymi may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services or other information that may be of interest; and
  9. Restrict the availability of some of the products, services and content to certain parts of the world, where required for legal reasons, by using your address, IP address and other information in order to enforce those restrictions.



You may always choose not to provide personal information, but if you so choose, our products and services may not be available to you. You agree that you are under no obligation to provide us with this information and can access many aspects of our Web sites without providing us any personal information.

While using the service and Web site, you may have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public forums at your own discretion. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in a publically available forum such as the Web site and agree to indemnify Nymi for any damages or claims resulting from any of your postings. Nymi is not obligated to monitor postings and at its discretion may remove any content submitted.

### Disclosure of your personal information

Except as otherwise disclosed to you, Nymi will not sell or rent your personal information to any other party and will only use and disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected as described in this Privacy Policy. However, you agree that Nymi may disclose your personal information in the circumstances set out below:

  1. Nymi may disclose your personal information with your prior consent;
  2. Nymi may be required by law to disclose personal information without your consent in the event of emergency situations or when required by government or other legal authority;
  3. Nymi may also disclose personal information to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, provided that, where appropriate, any party to whom the information is disclosed is bound by agreements or obligations, and required to use or disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise; or
  4. Nymi may share your personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, collect debts, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders, to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service. Each company is bound by agreement or obligations with Nymi to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices in order to use and disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.



### How to opt-out / withdraw consent

You can withdraw your consent for the use of your personal information at any time by deleting your Account. Information may be retained by Nymi for audit or archival purposes or as required by applicable federal and provincial laws.

If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included within each e-mail communication or by selecting or deselecting (depending on the service) the appropriate option in your Account settings.   Please keep in mind that, even if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional or account communications related to services or products that you have requested (e.g. purchase confirmation e-mails and receipts).

### How long we keep Personal Information

Nymi maintains information about you for as long as we provide service to you, and longer for related business activities. After information is no longer necessary for our business purposes, we destroy the information unless there is an outstanding request or order to preserve the information.

### Safeguards we have in place

Nymi stores and process your personal information on our computers principally in Canada as well as on internationally. Nymi employs reasonable managerial and technical measures to ensure that your personal information is secure. In addition, our dedicated team of information technology professionals works to maintain data accuracy and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.  Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it.
