# Nymi | Privacy Policy

At Bionym Inc.(“ **Bionym** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **our** ” and “ **us** ”) we are committed to protecting your privacy, and support a general policy of openness about how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about Bionym’s practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be provided through access to or use of our website located at www.getnymi.com **** (the “ **Website** ”).  By using our Website, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (as defined below) in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a question about, want to make a change to or delete any personal information that Bionym may be holding about you.  We strongly recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Policy and retain it for future reference.

### Personal Information

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual.

### What Personal Information We Collect

The personal information we may collect in the course of you access or using the Website may include at least some of the following:

  1. contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number in a non-business capacity);
  2. proof of identity;
  3. financial and billing information (such as credit card number/expiration date and credit history); and ** **



### How We Use Your Personal Information

We use your personal information to:

  1. provide you with personalized services and interactive communication;
  2. provide you with timely and reliable services;
  3. allow you to pre-order the Nymi product;
  4. fulfill warranty-related obligations related to the Nymi product;
  5. do all the things necessary to administer the Website;

  7. advise you about new products and services that may be of interest to you;
  8. develop and maintain our relationship with you and communicate with you;
  9. bill you for our products and services; and
  10. collect outstanding debts.



### When We Disclose Your Personal Information

Except with your consent, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others.

Bionym may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above.  These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information collected by them on behalf of Bionym or disclosed to them by Bionym and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.

Bionym reserves the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so.

Bionym also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of Bionym or of any of the business or assets or shares of Bionym **** or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.

### Knowledge and Consent

Bionym collects personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it.  Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection.  In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).

The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.  If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us using the contact information provided in the “Contacting Us” section of this Privacy Policy.  We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.

We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

### Use or Disclosure for Marketing Purposes

If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us, including by means of direct marketing.

You can choose not to allow us to use or disclose your personal information for direct marketing purposes by contacting us as outlined below (see “Contacting Us”).

### Cookies

When you visit the Website, we or one of our third party service providers (e.g., Google Analytics) places a text file called a “cookie” in the browser directory of your computer’s hard drive.  A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store on your web browser and later retrieve.  The cookie cannot be read by any website other than the one that set up the cookies.  Some browsers can be set to reject all cookies.  If you choose to modify your browser in this manner, some pages of this website may not function properly.

These third party service providers use cookies on our behalf to anonymously collect and store Internet log information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to this site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Geographic data is also determined by the IP address of the visitor’s computer. This anonymous information collected by the cookie is transmitted to our third party service providers and is then used to evaluate visitors’ behaviour and to generate statistical reports for the website activity on the Website.

### How We Protect Your Personal Information

Bionym makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected from you is protected against loss, theft and unauthorized access.  This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard copy form.  Access to your personal information is restricted to selected employees or representatives.  In addition, Bionym employs generally accepted information security techniques, such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography, to protect personal information against loss and unauthorized access. ** **

### Links to Third Party Sites

This Website may offer links to other third party websites.  You should be aware that operators of linked websites may also collect your personal information (including information generated through the use of cookies) when you link to their websites.  Bionym is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information, so it is important to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your personal information.

### Retention and Storage of Your Personal Information

Bionym retains your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purposes(s) remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.

For the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we or one of our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider may process and store your personal information outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada, and under the laws of those other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access your personal information. For more information about our policies and practices related to the possible use of foreign service providers, please contact us as set out below.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Bionym reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to reflect changes in legal or regulatory obligations or changes in the manner in which we deal with personal information.
