# Privacy Statement

  
We are always striving to make Genki English the best we can! We take the privacy of our viewers seriously and have hence added this privacy statement to the site.

The information collected by Genki English falls into 3 basic categories:

**1\. Email addresses used for distribution of the Genki English newsletters.**

The addresses collected here are purely for the stated use. The newsletter is handled by Yahoo Groups, who may ask other demographic questions upon registration. Occasionally advertisements may appear in these newsletters. However we DO NOT sell or make available the names of recipients to any other company or organisation.

**2\. Personal data collected for products to be delivered  in Japan.**

We collect information that is needed by the post office in Japan for delivery via the "Daibiki" (cash on delivery) system. This information is again held by Genki English and is not made available to any other parties. Occasionally we may use the information collected here to inform customers of new updates, special offers or free gifts. However there is a check box on the order form if you would prefer us not to provide this service.

**3 Personal data collected for products to be delivered  outside Japan.**

This information is collected by our Credit Card handlers, CCnow (http://www.ccnow.com). Customer's names and addresses are then forwarded to Genki English. We at Genki English never see your credit card information.

We carefully control the links to other sites, however we cannot accept responsibility for content that is not part of Genki English. Similarly, you may occasionally see advertisements on these pages and these are not always for companies  connected with Genki English. It is also our policy not to feature third party advertisements on our pages which are designed for children i.e. the "Kawaii Eigo" section.

As with anything else on this site, if you have any further questions or comments then please [contact me.

Be genki,
