## 6\. Non-Personal Information and Cookies

When you visit our Website, we may automatically collect information or computer-generated data that does not personally identify you (“Non-Personal Information”). Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose, including sharing that information with our group companies and with other third parties, unless we are required to treat any such information as personal under applicable law. For example: 

  * We automatically receive and record Non-Personal Information on our server logs from your browser, including the website from which you have come to our Website, your Media Access Control address, computer type, screen resolution, operating system and Internet browser, as well as information based on your interaction with the Website, such as web log information, IP addresses our cookie information, search activity, and the pages you request. We also collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, such as billing partners, including information about your use of search products and information we offer. We also use Non-Personal Information to deliver the Website and our Services to you and to help diagnose problems with our server.
  * We may also collect Non-Personal Information such as demographic data, age groups, and your geographic areas, etc. Non-Personal Information also includes personal information that has been aggregated in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Website, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code or who are female. This technology helps us compile aggregated statistics about our users and their use of the Website. We use these statistics to improve the design and content of the Website and to prepare and deliver our marketing programs. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with personal information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do combine any Non-Personal Information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information, as long as it is combined, and its use by us will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
  * We (either ourselves or our appointed third parties) may place and access cookies, tags, beacons, and/or scripts on your computer to analyze the use of the Website and optimize and customize the Website and your experience. These technologies do not extract any private contact information or other personal information from your computer's memory, but rather record only limited information your computer sends us when you visit our Website, such as your IP address. Cookies enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time you return. Archives may make limited use of cookies to deliver content and advertisements specific to your interests. For instance, they may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you login. These technologies may also be used to see how you move around and interact with the Website or may be used to show you relevant ads either on or off the Website.
  * You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain portions of the Website may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. 
  * If you access the Website using a mobile device (e.g. your phone or tablet), we may collect mobile device identifiers such as the device type, IP address and the operating system. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to deliver you the Website and better understand the functionality of our Website and services. 



## 7\. About our advertisements

  * We strive to show you relevant advertisements both on our Website and elsewhere on the Internet. We use some third parties to show you Archives-related advertisements that are tailored to you based upon your interests or online behaviors. We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement – for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
  * Any such targeted ads placed on our behalf will contain information on or near them that informs you about the third party delivering you the ads and how to opt-out of receiving such ads in the future. If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads from third parties, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). 
  * Please note that the above links do not opt you out of being served advertising. Because occasionally the Website may be partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on the Website pages. You will continue to receive generic ads that may not be as relevant to you. If you are concerned about other interest-based ads you are receiving on other websites, you may want to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for additional opt-out information. Also, please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

We may update this policy. From time to time, we will review our information collection, use, and disclosure practices in order to assure that we are complying with our Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a notice on the Website.
