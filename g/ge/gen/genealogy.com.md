# Genealogy.com: Privacy Statement

  
**Your Privacy  
** At Genealogy.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders, to help create your own home page and family tree, and to provide a more personalized experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site. Until you initiate a voluntary transaction with the site, we do not collect personal information about you (such as your e-mail address). Transactions include making a purchase, creating a home page, conducting a search, taking part in a survey, and other voluntary actions. Once you do initiate a transaction, we ask for certain information as specified below: 

When you make a purchase, we ask for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. If you choose, you may also include your phone number as an alternate means by which we may contact you. 

When you create a home page, save a family story, or build a family tree, we ask for your e-mail address and other personal information to enable other genealogists with similar interests to contact you. You may choose not to post this information. This also enables us to send you the URL (or Web address) of your new home page. Your home page, story, and family tree are posted at a Web site for which only you will have the URL and password to edit and delete. Your content automatically becomes part of an online archive that others can see and search, but you have the option to make parts of the content on your home page private. 

**  
** When you take part in a survey, or enter a contest, we ask for your e-mail address and other personal information so that we can contact you regarding prizes won or to send you information that we think might be of interest to you.

When you conduct a search, we ask for the name(s) you are researching. This information might be used to improve your ability to use our site in the future but will not be shared with others unless you specifically ask us to.

Our policy is not to collect personal information from children, meaning those under 18 years of age, on Genealogy.com. 

**How Do We Use It?**  
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages, customize the content and/or layout of our Web pages, notify you about updates to our Web site, send you your personal identification number and password, and/or contact you for marketing purposes, if you have chosen to receive such information. If you would rather not receive marketing information, it is easy to unsubscribe by following the instructions at the end of any e-mail that you receive or by going to <http://www.genealogy.com/unsubscribe.html>. We also post some personal information online so that other genealogists may contact you, but you may choose not to post this information. We do not post or otherwise make available at the site any information pertaining to your credit card, purchase history, or payment methods. 

**How Does Genealogy.com Protect Customer Information?**  
When you make a purchase or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL encrypts your order information and is designed to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Genealogy.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then be assured that SSL is active. Furthermore, Genealogy.com has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and appropriation of data. We cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or appropriation will not occur, but we make every effort to ensure that they do not. 

**What About "Cookies"?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as creating home pages and subscribing to the Library. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our site. 

**Does Genealogy.com Disclose the Information It Collects?**  
Genealogy.com does not share any contact information with third parties except marketing companies engaged by Genealogy.com, under the control and direction of Genealogy.com, and on behalf of Genealogy.com. Genealogy.com maintains ownership and control of this information. Genealogy.com may provide group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Remember, if you do not want to receive electronic mailings from us, you may opt out at any time by going to <http://www.genealogy.com/unsubscribe.html>.
