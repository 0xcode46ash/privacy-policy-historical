# Genome, powered by OSM, privacy policy

Genome, powered by OSM ("Genome"), is a technology platform offered by interclick, inc. that leverages interclick's proprietary technology, OSM. interclick is a leading technology company providing data-driven advertising solutions for advertisers. In the course of providing these services, interclick collects and analyzes the online behaviors of consumers across its network of sites. It is critical to interclick that consumers' privacy, rights and choices are maintained during this process.

Accordingly, Genome is committed to following interclick's privacy guidelines in accordance with [NAI privacy principles](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). This document is intended to inform consumers how interclick collects, maintains and processes information we collect in the delivery of our network advertising services.

On the interclick network, we collect non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.

interclick does create nor use any sensitive data segments to provide its targeted and optimized digital marketing solutions for advertisers. However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data segments collected and used by our technology solutions, interclick will provide examples of them here.

For example, we may use health related segments such as  _Interest > Health, Beauty & Personal Care > Health_ ([click here](https://web.archive.org/legal/health-segments.aspx) for a complete health segment list); or financial segments such as  _In-Market > Financial Products & Services > Credit Products_ ([click here](https://web.archive.org/legal/financial-segments.aspx) for a complete financial segment list).

While we never use these segments to identify, locate or contact consumers, interclick encourage consumers to contact us for more information about our use of potentially sensitive data segments at [privacy@interclick.com](mailto:privacy@interclick.com). And if you want to view the segments that interclick has stored about your browsing behavior for targeting purposes, [click here](https://web.archive.org/legal/opt-out.aspx) and scroll to section entitled "My Categories."

Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to recognize the computer when you revisit the site. Generally, sites use this cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as valuable and relevant to you as possible.

Like many websites, interclick sets a cookie on your computer containing an anonymous identifier. This cookie allows interclick to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant advertising.

You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

Alternatively, you may [click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from interclick](https://web.archive.org/legal/opt-out.aspx "opt-out"). Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.

interclick has created a technology that uses any consumer information to create anonymous consumer segments. For example, consumers that demonstrate car-buying behaviors are grouped into an auto-buyer segment. These segments will be used to target and optimize advertiser campaigns. interclick will never use this information to identify, locate or contact consumers.

interclick has created a technology platform called Genome, powered by OSM. Genome is a self-service audience recommendation and planning platform that enables our advertising partners to create anonymous consumer segments  (e.g., travel enthusiast) to target and optimize their advertiser campaigns. interclick requires our advertising partners to use these segments in accordance with privacy law and industry standards (e.g., the [NAI privacy principles](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)). However, interclick is not ultimately responsible for the privacy practices of any of our advertising partners, and encourages consumers to read the privacy policies of any website they visit.

We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 90 days. This data includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.

We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquiries about privacy concerns. Please contact us at [privacy@interclick.com](mailto:privacy@interclick.com) or the address below with any questions of complaints.

For more information, please see the [Network Advertising Initiative web site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

You can opt-out of the targeted advertising delivered by interclick by requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by interclick, which will prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser. This allows you to opt-out of the interclick tracking system without erasing other cookies associated with your browser.

This opt-out means that interclick will not store information unique to your browser behavior and will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next. Opting-out does not mean you will not receive online advertising. However, because the network is not able to uniquely identify your browser, interclick is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again. [Click here to visit the opt-out page](https://web.archive.org/legal/opt-out.aspx "opt-out").

To opt out of all NAI member networks' behavioral tracking, please visit the [NAI opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

interclick reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change it, we will post a link from our homepage, and possibly other highly visible places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
