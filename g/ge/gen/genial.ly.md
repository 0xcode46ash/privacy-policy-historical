## Genially Privacy Policy.

Last updated March 24, 2017. 

This Genially Privacy Policy provides information on how Genially collects personal data and how it uses that data. Although we believe our approach to processing personal data is fair and reasonable, please review this document carefully as we want to make sure you have full transparency with regard to how your data is used. 

### I. Name and address of the data controller

Genially Web S.L.   
C/ Claudio Marcelo, nº6-1ª planta. 14002 Córdoba   
Registered in the Registro Mercantil de Córdoba, Book 2154, Sheet 51, number CO-35517, registration 1ª - C.I.F. B-56019912.   


### II. Name of the register

Genially User Register. 

### III. The type of information we collect

We collect both Use Data (which as such does not contain personal data or other personally identifiable information) and Personal Data. 

**Use Data.** When you use the Genially service, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of your "IP address") about your activities while visiting the websites, including the web pages you view and the times you view them and information about the browser you are using. We use this browsing information for internal purposes such as to help us understand how the websites are being used and to improve them, and for systems administration purposes. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. 

The Use Data generally does not contain any Personal Data. However, in some cases Use Data can be stored together with your Personal Data in such a way that the Use Data could be considered to be Personal Data as well. In such cases we handle it in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

**Personal data and personally identifiable information (”Personal Data”).** In some circumstances we can also collect Personal Data, such as your name and address. This could occur upon you registering as a user of the Genially service. In such cases, what type of personal data we ask you to provide will be clearly indicated, and that Personal Data will be stored and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

We view protection of users' privacy as a very important community principle. We understand clearly that you and your information are one of our most important assets. We store and process your Personal Data (if any) on computers located in the U.S. or E.U. that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices. By using the Genially service, you give Genially Web S.L. consent to store, process and transfer your personal information (if any) outside of your country of residence within the U.S. or E.U. If you object to your personal information (if any) being transferred or used in this way, please do not use the Genially service. 

We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use any features of the Genially service that would require you to provide Personal Data to us. 

### IV. The purposes for which we use the information

We use the information we collect for the purposes of providing and developing the Genially service. Some of the features our service offers may rely on the use of information we have collected from you in order to ensure that a given feature is customized and targeted for your specific use. 

The Personal Data you provide can also be used for direct marketing unless you let us know that you do not wish to receive such marketing or marketing from our partners, provided that you have given your express opt-in consent. The Personal Data can also be used for contacting you if required for the provision of the Genially service. 

### V. Your right to inspect the information

Genially does not verify the accuracy of the Personal Data you provide. You have the right to inspect the Personal Data we have in store about you in the Genially User Register either via the Genially service (if we, in our sole discretion, offer such functionality) or by requesting it in writing from Genially. 

### VI. Disclosure of the information to third parties

As noted above, Genially uses third-party service providers (“Hosting Providers”) for hosting the service and storing the information collected from you and other users. Apart from Hosting Providers, Genially does not disclose your Personal Data to third parties unless: 

  1. you have provided us with your express opt-in consent for doing so;
  2. the disclosure is reasonably necessary for us to be able to enforce our Terms of Service;
  3. the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud or security breaches; or
  4. applicable law requires us to disclose it .



We may share aggregate Use Data (provided that it does not contain any Personal Data) to select third parties. 

### VII. Removal of information from the register

You can request the removal of any Personal Data by contacting Genially. Removal of any Personal Data does not, however, affect the license to the User Material granted by you to Genially in accordance to the Terms of Use. 

### VIII. Cookies.

We use cookies for the purpose of providing enhanced end-user functionality to users of the Genially service, as well as calculating statistics related to the use of the service. Cookies enable us, for example, to remember various user preferences you have set and to calculate unique user statistics relating to the use of the Genially service. 

When using the Genially service you might on occasions also be exposed to cookies provided by third parties such as Facebook, Google, and other third-party service providers with which the Genially service can be used. Genially cannot be responsible for how these third-party cookies are used, and you should consult the privacy policies of these third parties for more information about how they use cookies. 

### IX. Data Security

Genially uses industry standard security mechanisms to protect the information stored in the User Register. Personal Data and backups are stored in protected databases located behind a firewall and with both physical and software-based access controls. 

## Genially Cookie Policy

Last updated March 24, 2017. 

Genially respects your privacy. We want to ensure that you have a full understanding of how information about you is collected when you are using our service and thus can make informed decisions about your privacy. To this end, we have prepared this cookie policy. 

We have also included information about cookies set by third parties (“Third-Party Cookies”). Given that these relate to third-party services, we cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the list, but we can say that we have done our best to ensure the list is as accurate as possible at the time this policy was prepared. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you consult the third- party websites listed in the cookie descriptions to find out more about the third-party cookies in question. 

Our aim is to ensure that this policy is continuously updated to reflect any material changes in our use of cookies. If we change this policy, we will post an updated version on our site at Genial.ly. 

### Cookies set by Genially

Genially uses cookies to improve performance and enhance the user experience for those who visit our website. This policy clarifies how we do this and how cookies are managed. 

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page in order to remember your user preferences, help analyze the website’s performance and to recommend content relevant to your visit. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. Most cookies will not collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user’s general location. What cookies do we use? Genially´s website uses cookies to inform us about how our website is operating, remember your preferences for services such as language choice, what you’ve chosen to purchase and other settings. Without these cookies installed, many of the services offered by the website will fail to function. 

### Cookies set by third parties

Since Genially is a service which allows content to be included from third-party sites and in other third-party sites, all of these sites may provide cookies on their own in addition to the above listed cookies. For example, viewing a YouTube tag can give you cookies from YouTube. We have no control or knowledge of those cookies. We recommend that you review your browser's privacy settings and adjust them accordingly if you wish to deny cookies from these third-party sites.
