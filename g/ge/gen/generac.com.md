# Generac Power Systems - Privacy Statement

General

Generac Power Systems respects the privacy of every individual who visits the Generac Power Systems Web Site ("Site") or provides information to us over the Internet. This Privacy Policy outlines what information Generac Power Systems ("Generac") will collect and how we will treat the information.

When you visit the Site, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. Portions of the Site may request visitors to submit names, e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information in connection with registering for product information. By submitting personally identifiable information, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to this information being used exclusively by Generac for business purposes. If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information, no material consequences will result, although you may be unable to receive specific product information.

Generac may store and process personally identifiable information to better understand our visitors needs and how we may improve our products and services. However, we will not trade, rent or sell personal information gathered online about our visitors. We will not provide your e-mail address, or any other information gathered from visits to the Site, to any outside organization or send unsolicited e-mail to any of the addresses provided to us. Individually identifiable information submitted in connection with employment inquiries will be used only in the employment process.

Generac may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable such as domain names (e.g. aol.com, etc.), browsers, and the specific pages accessed or visited on the Site. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages viewed and methods by which our site was found. Generac collects this information to evaluate the use of and to make improvements to the Site.

We will not send unsolicited email to our customers or visitors to the Site. We will use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from visitors or engage in other communication which the visitor has expressly requested.

Children

Generac will not knowingly solicit personally identifiable information (name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) from individuals under the age of majority and will not encourage children to use the Site or market our products to children. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy to request that this information be deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases.

Links

The Generac Site may contain links to other web sites. Generac provides links from the Site merely as a convenience and the inclusion of such links does not imply an endorsement by Generac of the sites. Generac is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any other web sites linked to the Site. If you link to another web site from the Site, please review the privacy policies posted at these sites.

Policy Changes

Because Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, this Privacy Policy is subject to change. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will update this page to keep you informed on how we will use your information.
