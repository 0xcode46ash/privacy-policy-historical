**Privacy Policy**

**We respect your privacy. Your Email address and any other data you provide us will never be released to a third party. All our Email lists and Membership forms use the Opt-In model. These Emails always include a procedure and instructions to remove yourself from our lists. We do use "cookies" on this site. We use "cookies" to retain your user name and password for our geek/talk Bulletin Board and in our Contests, Polls, Quizzes, and Surveys.

Certain sections of this site log and display your IP number. This includes our geek/talk Forums For Webmasters. IP numbers are not secret and have been used for years. Every site you visit logs and often displays your IP number. We use this procedure for your protection as well as our own. It helps us protect our members from abuse, permits members of our Bulletin Board to "flush" impostors and "Abusers", provides us with the additional evidence to aggressively pursue "Abusers", and acts as a deterrent for "Abusers". If you use a Broadband connection to the Web such as Cable or DSL, you should install a firewall on your system to protect it from third party abuse. We have received good reports about [ZoneAlarm](http://www.zonelabs.com/), [BlackICE](http://www.networkice.com/index.html), and the [Linksys Router](http://www.linksys.com/). Then check the integrity of your system using [Shields UP](http://grc.com/). If our IP procedures still make you nervous or are inconsistent with your wishes, please leave our site and do not return.

**This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site. If you visit our site we collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
