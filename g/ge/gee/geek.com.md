Geek.com Privacy Statement 

Geek.com has created this privacy policy to assure our visitors that their privacy is respected. Your privacy is important to us. In this document we outline the ways that we collect information, and describe how this information is used.

**Information Automatically Logged  
**We log our users IP addresses to determine how many unique visitors we have. We also log general demographic information such as browser type and operating system of users.

**Advertisers and opting-out  
**At any given time, we have several advertisers who may be running ads through Engage, Doubleclick, Avenue A or other ad agencies or networks. These ads may send cookies or serve 1x1 blank pixel gifs to your browser to collect information that may include: date/time of banner shown, the banner shown, their cookie, and the IP address. 

While we currently do not use cookies on the rest of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may be placed and collected by our advertisers. We do not have specific access to the information placed in and gathered by these cookies. If you wish to opt out of these advertising programs, please go to the [Network Advertising Organization's opt-out page](https://web.archive.org/web/20010607070359id_/http%3A//www.geek.com/www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp%20).

**Engage-specific statement:** Geek.com uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data typically through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>.

**Sale of T-shirts and other apparel  
**We link to [Copyleft.net](http://www.copyleft.net/) to sell Geek.com T-shirts. Copyleft collects contact information (email address, shipping address, phone numbers) and financial information (credit card numbers) in order to process orders. Geek.com does not have access to customer information.

**Geek.com Survey  
**Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, occupation, income level, etc.). E-mail addresses from the surveys may be used to get in touch with the visitor if we have questions about their entry. They may also opt-in to any of the Geek.com newsletters through the survey. E-mail addresses are not required to complete the survey.

Demographic information from the survey is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

**External Links  
**Geek.com contains links to other sites. Geek.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Special Relationships  
**We have a relationship with [Mailstartplus.com](http://www.mailstartplus.com/) for our e-mail services. Information collected by Mailstart during e-mail account signup is covered by the Mailstart privacy policy. That information is available to Geek.com staff for anonymous demographic analysis and presentation to third parties as anonymous demographics. Geek.com does not sell, give away, barter or in any way provide our list of e-mail subscribers to any third party.

Geek.com also has relationships with [Necx.com](http://www.necx.com/), [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) and others to provide goods and services to our customers through affiliate links and other similar arrangements.

**Submission Mechanisms**  
Geek.com has many mechanisms for users to submit content to us, including CGI scripts and e-mail. Many of our submission forms request that you give us your name along with a news item, story, tip or question. This information may be published to the site. If you do not want your name published with this information, please let us know within your submission.

**Public Forums

Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
