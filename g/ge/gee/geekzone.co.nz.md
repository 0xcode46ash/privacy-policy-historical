Geekzone Privacy Policy 

  
  


We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is not used to identify you. However, all posts in our forums and comments to articles have an associated IP address recorded. This IP address is never shown to other users and it is only collected in order to help us to prevent unsolicited posting to our forums (spam) or other breaches of our [**Forum Usage Guidelines (FUG)**](http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=1046).

All users have their user name, country and date of inclusion listed in our [**User List**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130512123037id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/users.asp). This list is only visible to other registered users. The _email_ icon allows users to send private messages between them, but neither the sender's or recipient's email addresses are disclosed. If the user requires privacy, an option is available on your [**user profile page**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130512123037id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/user_profile.asp) to hide the user name from this list and prevent other users from contacting via those private messages. 

You user profile page will be indexed by search engines. If you don't want your name and/or location showing up in search engine results, by all means leave those fields empty.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your login. Cookies are simple data files that store information. We do not install any program on your computer while visiting our site. The information stored in the cookie file is used to store the login information if the user decides to use our auto login feature. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and optional demographic information (like city and country). If the user opts in, we use the contact information (email address) from the registration form to send any important information regarding its registration with Geekzone. Users may opt-out of receiving future contacts at any time. Please update your [**user profile page**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130512123037id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/user_profile.asp) to change this option or simply [**contact us**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130512123037id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/contact.asp).

The [**Geekzone Software Store**](http://store.geekzone.co.nz/) is managed by Mobihand, and it also uses cookies. The information stored in that cookie file is used to manage your shopping cart while the user is selecting software from the on-line store.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser server may place or recognize a unique cookie file.
