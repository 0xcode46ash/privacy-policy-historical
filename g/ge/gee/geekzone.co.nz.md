We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is not used to identify you. However, all posts in our forums and comments to articles have an associated IP address recorded. This IP address is never shown to other users and it is only collected in order to help us to prevent unsolicited posting to our forums (spam).

All users have their user name, country and date of inclusion listed in our [**User List**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415212532id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/users.asp). This list is only visible to other registered users. The _e-mail_ icon allows users to send private messages between them, but neither the sender's or recipient's e-mail addresses are disclosed. If the user requires privacy, an option is available on your [**user profile page**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415212532id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/user_profile.asp) to hide the user name from this list. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your login. Cookies are simple data files that store information. We do not install any program on your computer while visiting our site. The information stored in the cookie file is used to store the login information if the user decides to use our auto login feature. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address) and optional demographic information (like city and country). If the user opts in, we use the contact information (e-mail address) from the registration form to send our weekly newsletter and any important information regarding its registration with Geekzone. Users may opt-out of receiving future newsletter at any time. Please use [**My Profile**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415212532id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/user_profile.asp) to unsubscribe from our newsletter or simply [**contact us**](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415212532id_/http%3A//www.geekzone.co.nz/contact.asp).

The [**Geekzone Software Store**](http://store.geekzone.co.nz/) is managed by Mobihand, and it also uses a cookie. The information stored in that cookie file is used to manage your shopping cart while the user is selecting software from the on-line store.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser managers may place or recognize a unique cookie file.

We use Tribal Fusion, DoubleClick, and Google to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (but not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

More specifically Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google's use of the [**DART cookie**](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [**Google ad and content network privacy policy**](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
