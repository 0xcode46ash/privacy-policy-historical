**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

**(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)** ** **

Effective Date: February 1, 2017 – V1.2

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.

As stated in our Privacy Policy , we do share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please note that your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

You are entitled, but limited to the extent required by law, upon sending us a request by email at [support@](mailto:support@geru.com)geru.com to receive the following information: a) the names and addresses of all of the third parties that received personal information from us for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and, if the nature of that third parties' business cannot reasonably be determined from the third parties' name, examples of the products or services marketed, if known to us, sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third parties' business and; b) a list of the categories of information that correspond to the personal information disclosed by us to such third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes as set forth in the applicable law.

California customers may request further information about our compliance with the law referenced above by e-mailing [support@](mailto:Support@geru.com)geru.com.
