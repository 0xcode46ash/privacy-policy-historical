# The Gerontological Society of America

**_Who We Are_**

This is The Gerontological Society of America's ("GSA") Internet Privacy Policy. You can write to us at 1220 LStreet, NW, Suite 901, Washington, DC, 20005. We can be reached by email at [geron@geron.org](mailto:geron@geron.org), or you can call us at 202-842-1175.

GSA values individual privacy and we want to give our website visitors the opportunity to know what information we collect about them and how they can limit the use of personally-identifiable information beyond the purposes for which they first provided it. At all times, however, GSA reserves the right to disclose information where required by law or to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to protect GSA's rights or property, including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of GSA or substantially all of its assets, or during emergencies when safety is at risk.

Whenever we change our policy, we will give reasonable notice by posting a notice on our home page. Since these policy change notices last only for a limited time, however, you should check this Privacy Policy regularly to see if there have been any changes.

**_Data We Collect and How We Use It_**

**Personally Identifiable Information**

We collect your email address if you communicate with us by email, as well as other information that you might supply voluntarily, such as survey information.

If you purchase a product or service at our site, we will also ask for your credit card number or other account number you wish to be charged. We do not give out your credit card or other account information to third parties unless you authorize us to do so or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities, including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service you order.

We may use this information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve our website and our services, to customize your experience at our website, or to send updates or notices about our organization and the products we offer that we think may be of interest to you. We may also combine this information with other generally or publicly available information to help us identify visitors' preferences or interests. We may provide information that identifies you to companies that assist us in these activities, such as helping us fulfill your request for a product, service or information.

GSA collects information from its members (including names, addresses, business phone numbers, business fax numbers, and email addresses) for inclusion in a membership directory that is distributed to the association's members and to purchasers of the print directory. Access to directory information is also available only to GSA's members on GSA's website. Further, with the members' express approval, GSA may occasionally provide, sell, or rent limited data to third parties, including companies that offer products and services for sale to GSA's members. This limited data includes names, job titles, companies/organizations, and business addresses, but do not include business phone numbers, business fax numbers, or email addresses.

**Children's Privacy**

GSA's website is intended for adults. GSA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If GSA obtains knowledge that it has personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in its files, GSA will delete that information from our existing files.

**Cookies & Computer-Related Information**

GSA does not enable "cookies" on our website with one exception. A cookie is used in website system administration to keep track of movement of an individual user from one screen to another. This information may be used by our staff to detect and resolve website problems and to assist with customer support. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about site visitors in this process.

Our web server automatically collects information from your computer and navigation patterns when you visit our site, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the computer's operating system, the type of browser you use, and the specific web pages visited during your connection. We may also track data such as the total number of visits to our website and the number of visitors to each page of our website.

We may use this information, in aggregate form, for system maintenance and to better understand how our visitors use our site and services so that we can make them better. GSA may also share statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties for marketing or research purposes. This aggregate data will not contain any information that personally identifies you.

**_How You Can Control and Update Data About You_**

We want to be sure that we keep only the most accurate and up‑to‑date information about you in our records. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact information needs to be updated, you can email us at [geron@geron.org](mailto:geron@geron.org) to correct or update your contact information.

You may choose at any time to remove your name, telephone and fax numbers, and postal and email addresses from the lists we use to send notices or updates and elect not to receive correspondence from us by emailing at [geron@geron.org](mailto:geron@geron.org).

Users may request that GSA refrain from disclosing to third parties the data it collects on its membership application form or any other form on which users are providing information by refraining from checking the "opt-in" box that appears on each form on which a user provides information. Alternatively, users may contact GSA at [geron@geron.org](mailto:geron@geron.org).

Other Internet sites you visit — including those linked from the GSA website — may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all. Other websites might use personal information differently than our policy permits. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site before providing any personal information.

**_Data Integrity and Security_**

We use state‑of‑the‑art technology to keep any information you provide as secure as possible. We also have in place privacy protection control contractual obligations with our vendors designed to ensure that personal data is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. All GSA employees must abide by GSA's Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees are permitted to have access to personally-identifiable data about website visitors, and that access is limited to what is reasonably needed to perform an employee's responsibilities, such as providing updates or notices or customer service. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
