# Privacy Notice

Please take a moment to read the following Privacy Notice. You do not need to call us or do anything as a result of this notice. It is meant to inform you of some important information about our privacy policy and your rights. 

##  Our Information Confidentiality and Security Policy 

Our most important asset is our customers’ trust. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal financial information. We permit only authorized persons who are trained in the proper handling of customer information to have access to that information. Gerber Life does not sell customer information to marketing, mailing list or telemarketing companies. 

##  Information We May Collect 

We may collect nonpublic personal financial information about you from the following sources: 

  * From your insurance application, information such as your name, address and telephone number; 
  * From third parties, such as claims, consumer or medical reports; 
  * From your transactions with us, information such as your premium payment and claim history. 



##  Use and Disclosure 

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal financial information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. 

## General

This notice pertains to data collected from you when you use the informational portion of our website or the websites of third parties. Please refer to “Our Information Confidentiality and Security Policy” regarding data collected when you may apply to Gerber Life for insurance.

Many of the ways in which you interact with the Gerber Life internet site allow us to learn about you.  We collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis.  For example, we track the number of people who view each page to learn which features are the most popular.  In most instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information about you.

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, you have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal it to us.  Some examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include a request by you for information, providing feedback to us in connection with our website or registering for our internet newsletter. Personally identifiable information you may choose to provide can include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and other information you may wish to tell us.   If you do not provide all “required” information, however, some portions of our site will not work properly for you, or you may be denied access to certain sections of the Web site.

## How We Use And Disclose Your Information

We do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers or other third parties.  We use your information on personal and aggregated basis to do such things as distribute email communications, operate our site, enhance our site, and sell and deliver advertising.  We also use this data, both aggregated and personally identifiable, to enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you.  We may disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties for purposes of analyzing our Web site traffic and optimizing how we lay out content on the site.

## Cookies And Other Tracking Methods

Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Site.  We use cookies, or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses, for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can help us tailor our Site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests.  Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do.

## Other Sites

Please note that if you provide any information on your own to parties who provide service to us or to any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.  We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.

## Limits On Our Abilities

We do not disclose personally identifiable information about users of our website to anyone, except as permitted by law.

## Security

We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personally identifiable information.  We permit only authorized persons who are trained in the proper handling of personally identifiable information to have access to that information.

## Changes To Web Site

We may change, move or delete portions of, or may add to, our site from time to time.
