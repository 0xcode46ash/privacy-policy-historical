# The University of Georgia Athletic Association

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Georgiadogs.com is a website operated by [Enlighten Sports Inc.](http://enlightensports.com/) (ESI) on behalf of the University of Georgia Athletic Association.

The Internet is an incomparable resource for information, that, now more than ever before, has become an integral part of daily life.  However, it is also a means of collecting personal details about you that you may not want to be made public – home address, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, to name a few. Some websites may be gathering this and other information about you without you even knowing about it.

ESI and its clients strive to make your Web surfing as private and secure as possible so that you can have a positive online experience that provides you with all the information you could ever dream of. So, although we do collect user data at times, we want to help ensure that it remains private and secure.

**Your Privacy**

ESI promises that it will not disclose your personal information to third parties except for trusted third parties with whom we have contracts; and even then, the purpose of the disclosure will be only to help us improve this and other ESI websites and to report about general usage. The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web site and to better serve our users. If we choose to disclose personal information, it will be with trustworthy third parties who have been contracted to work with ESI. In such a case, it will be for the sole purpose of providing aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information. These statistics will remain anonymous with no personal identifying information. ESI or the University of Georgia Athletic Association may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to:

  1. comply with law, 
  2. enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or 
  3. protect the rights, property or safety the website, its users or others.



At ESI, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to gauge customer satisfaction in order to better serve your wants and needs:

… When you order from our e-commerce stores, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process your order and ship it as quickly as possible.

… When you enter a contest or participate in other promotional features on Georgiadogs.com, we may ask for your name, phone number, address, e-mail address or additional demographic information so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

… We may also use the information we collect from you upon purchase and/or entry to conduct market research surveys. This way, ESI can be sure to provide the service and merchandise that our fans are looking for.

**Use of IP Address**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by this number.

ESI and its sites collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, reporting aggregate information to our advertisers, and auditing the use of our site. When guests request pages from these sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service, or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

**Use of Cookies**

The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies.

We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.  By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.

ESI has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. For example, our Web sites often include form entries. When entering a contest or sweepstakes, users enter several pieces of personal information. On a subsequent visit, this information may be used to automatically fill in portions of the form, thus saving the user from having to re-enter this information. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of our Web site services that our users find valuable.

**Disabling Cookies**

Visitors to ESI’s  websites always have the option of disabling cookies by simply turning off their browser’s functions that accommodate cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. 

\-- To disable cookies in Netscape 4.7, for example, simply go to “Preferences” under the “Edit” drop-menu. Select the “Advanced” option and select “Disable cookies.” Click “OK.”

\-- To disable cookies for Internet Explorer 5, for example, go to “Internet Options” under the “Tools” drop-menu. Select “Internet” within the “Security” tab and click on “Custom Level.” Select “disable” for both stored and per-session cookies. Click “OK.”

If you opt to disable cookies, note that some parts of the ESI network may not function properly or may be considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences, and it may take longer completing shopping transactions or entering contests.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. ESI does not control these cookies.

**Links to Other Sites**

Users should be aware that when they are on an ESI website, there will be opportunities to click on links that take them off of the ESI website. These links may be in the form of banner ads, for example, that take the user to that advertiser’s Web site. These sites are beyond our control, and may or may not subscribe to the same privacy and security statements as ESI and its affiliated athletic departments and organizations. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

**Security**

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. ESI will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, other than as specifically set forth below, ESI cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or the security of information we or our affiliates transmit to you.  You therefore send and receive information to and from ESI or Georgiadogs.com at your own risk.

Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

**Your Online Purchasing Security**

We guarantee a secure shopping experience. We protect you while you shop for your favorite Georgiadogs.com merchandise, so you never have to worry about online credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at Georgiadogs.com will be risk-free. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Georgiadogs.com.

**Guarantees**

Under the federal law, your credit card issuer cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your credit card issuer does hold you liable for up to $50.00, ESI will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. ESI will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made on Georgiadogs.com while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

**Your Consent**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by ESI as previously explained. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
