**True Credentials TM Corporate Identity Privacy Policy  
**True Credentials™ corporate identity is part of the GeoTrust comprehensive Safe MarketTM™ suite of B2B e-commerce risk management and trust services.

**Notice**

A True CredentialsTM corporate identity for a company consists of data, aggregated from third parties, that provides a picture of the business entity. This digital identity of a company is tied to its bids and offers listed in an eMarketplace. When potential transaction partners view the offer or bid, the company's business information is also available, enabling business decision-making based on real-time information. GeoTrust licenses the data used and displayed in True CredentialsTM corporate identity from third party data sources that are responsible for the content.

**Use of Cookies in True Credentials TM Corporate Identity**

Most Internet sites collect data about visitors through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small software programs that help sites recognize repeat visitors by assigning a random number to each desktop for anonymously tracking traffic patterns. If you have set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, you will notice that GeoTrust requests a cookie to be set on your computer. Its purpose is to let us know when you use our service. This cookie, by itself, only tells us that a previous GeoTrust visitor has returned. It does not tell us your e-mail address or who you are.

**What type of cookies do we use?** GeoTrust uses two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used during a unique user session and do not exist after the session ends. When you perform a profile viewing during a particular session, a session cookie associates a unique ID to your session, allowing you to view profile results until you close your web browser.

Persistent cookies remain on your computer's hard drive even after you close your web browser. A persistent cookie is used by True CredentialsTM corporate identity with a user's consent as a convenience to the user to prevent the True CredentialsTM corporate identity License and Usage Agreement from appearing on the user screen each time a True CredentialsTM corporate identity is accessed. If you decline to accept this cookie, the True CredentialsTM corporate identity License and Usage Agreement will be displayed every time you access True CredentialsTM corporate identity. When you accept this cookie from GeoTrust, it is telling us that you wish to view the License and Usage Agreement one time, and it should be displayed again only if the content of the License and Usage Agreement changes. This use of a cookie does not reveal the identity of the user, and GeoTrust will not know who you are unless you voluntarily decide to provide that information to us. You have the choice of opting out of this use of a cookie at any time by deleting the cookie from your machine. You can also set your browsers to notify you every time you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to choose whether to accept it or not. 

How to Set Your Cookie Preferences  
A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for our web site. It is used in our True CredentialsTM corporate identity software application to prevent the License Agreement from appearing each time that you access it. Here is how to set your cookie preferences:

You can find more information about cookies and Netscape on the Netscape web site.  
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x: In the view menu, select Options. Click on the Advanced tab. You may choose to be warned before accepting cookies.  
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x: In the view menu, select Options. Click on the Advanced tab and scroll down to a yellow triangle icon with an exclamation point labeled 'Cookies' where you have 3 options. Other Browsers: Contact the manufacturer of the browser for information.

**Choice**

The digital identity of an entity provided through the True CredentialsTM corporate identity is based upon publicly available third party data. Because GeoTrust does not own this data and because we are committed to providing an objective and complete profile of a business entity, we will not block, filter or change any of the data.

**Access**

When the validity of the information is disputed by an entity being displayed through the True CredentialsTM corporate identity, GeoTrust will facilitate the data dispute resolution process between the entity and the third party data source.
