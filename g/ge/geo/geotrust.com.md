This Privacy Policy describes our information-handling practices. This Privacy Policy applies only to information relating to those GeoTrust's services (the "Services") that are provided via the www.geotrust.com, www.trustwatch.com, and www.rapidssl.com public Internet web sites (the "Web Sites"), as described in the applicable Certificate Policy Statement, and does not apply to GeoTrust's corporate parents or affiliates or to any information collected or maintained for other purposes. This policy describes:

  * How we use and to whom we disclose Personal Information; 
  * Your choices concerning our uses of Personal Information; 
  * The security measures we use to protect Personal Information; 
  * Your rights to correct and update Personal Information; and

**INFORMATION COLLECTION & USE**  
GeoTrust is the sole owner of the Personal Information collected through our Web Sites or in connection with the Services. _Data Collected from non-Registered Users_

You may visit the Web Sites without providing any Personal Information. 

_Data Collected from Registered Users_

We need to collect Personal Information such as name, phone number, email address, state, and country in order for you to register for Services or to respond to your requests for information that you may submit to us through the Web Site. We use this information to process your requests, to administer the Services in which you have expressed interest, and to provide information to you relating to our Services. You may have the option to provide additional demographic information (such as job title, corporation affiliation, geographic location, or other data) through the Web Sites. We use this information to analyze interest in the Web Site and to improve the information we make available through the Web Sites. 

We may send periodic email updates to registered users, providing information about related products or services. We provide the option not to receive these types of communications, as described below under "Choice and Opt-out." This paragraph applies to users of our TrustWatch service: Your Personal Information may be used in accordance with the applicable TrustWatch Toolbar License Agreement . Certain information including your IP address and information about the sites you visit will be transmitted to Alexa Internet, Inc., which will then become subject to Alexa's privacy policy (http://pages.alexa.com/help/privacy.html). Alexa aggregates and analyzes the information it collects to improve its web traffic analysis services and to prepare non-identifiable reports about aggregate web usage. 

_Data Collected through Referrals_

We provide a mechanism for you to refer other persons whom you believe may be interested in our Services. In such cases, we will send the referral a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our Web Site. We maintain this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program, but will not send further unsolicited communications. 

We engage third party services such as TechTarget and KnowledgeStorm to identify potential users of our Services. These services employ their own mechanisms to enable individuals to opt out of email distribution lists. 

_External Links_

Our Web Site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by GeoTrust. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites that you may access from our Web Site. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

_Automated Web Site Tracking_

When you visit one of our Web Sites, statistics about your visit are automatically collected. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to the Web Site. This information may include how many people visit the Web Site, the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, which pages are visited, from which domains our visitors come and which types of browsers these persons use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregate, analytical purposes only, to help us improve the performance and effectiveness of our Web Site. We retain third party service providers, such as WebTrends (http://www.webtrends.com/), to provide these statistical analysis services. The techniques for collecting this information are described below: 

_Log Files_

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information about our user community. Unless we separately notify you, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information. 

_Cookies_

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Web Sites. We do/do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit through our Web Sites. We use both session cookies and permanent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close you browser. A permanent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may decline to accept cookies or may remove permanent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

We use temporary cookies to help your browser navigate our Web Site, to determine which visitors reach our Web Site from sites of our business partners, and to record during a user's session that the user is properly authenticated. We use permanent cookies to recall your information to save you time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our Web Site and to determine which visitors to our Web Sites have visited them before and if so, for what purposes. 

If you reject cookies, you may still generally access the informational material on our Web Sites, but you may be unable to obtain some of our Services or access some portions of our Web Sites. 

_Certificate Application Information_

In order to issue digital certificates and provide our Services, we must collect and maintain Personal Information about prospective Certificate Holders. Our information requirements may vary according to the type of Service being requested, as provided in the applicable service agreements, enrollment forms, and/or certificate applications. This information may include name; corporate affiliation; job title; postal address; telephone numbers; email address; gender; date of birth; dates of employment; and driver's license, passport or other government-issued identification documents numbers. We use this information to document and verify the identities or persons to whom we issue certificates or provide Services. We require documentation establishing that certificate applicants have expressly consented to the use of their Personal Information in connection with our Services. 

_Subscriber Information_

This information may include name; corporate affiliation; job title; postal address; years at address; telephone numbers; email address; state license status and license numbers; Dun & Bradstreet number; credit card and bank account number and related billing and payment information; and IP addresses.

For our True Identity product, we may also collect Social Security Number and date of birth to present dynamically generated questions based on information contained in the individual's credit report. We use, this information to develop an identity verification score. The score comprises an estimate of the likelihood that a person is the person he or she claims to be. This information is periodically deleted and is collected and transmitted in an encrypted form. 

_Customer Service_

We may send Service-related announcements when we believe it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Service is temporarily unavailable, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you may terminate any Services that you receive from us. We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the Services you request, and as we determine is necessary to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone, or postal mail, depending upon the nature and urgency of the matter. 

We also provide a web-based form for submitting service-related questions to us. This form requests name, company name, email address, and phone number. This personal information is used to contact the submitter to respond to the service inquiry. 

_Supplementation of Information_ v 

In order to provide the Services, we may supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources. For example, we may use the WHOIS database of Internet domain name registrants or may engage third party business information services (such as Dun & Bradstreet, Authentify, or ChoicePoint, among others) to obtain verified information about subscribers, to verify personal identification for certificate applicants, or to assess the continued eligibility or license status of certificate holders or subscribers. We use these sources only to verify information.
