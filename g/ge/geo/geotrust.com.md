Revised: June 16, 2000

The following information reflects our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [www.GeoTrust.com](http://www.geotrust.com/). In addition, this privacy policy is designed to describe the information collected electronically by GeoTrust's software applications and information services that are related to this Web site.

We gather only the information that is essential to providing good service to our customers, partners and web site visitors. We do not sell, lease or license confidential information to outside parties. We only share confidential information to outside parties directly related to the delivery and service of our products or services. Details of how we collect and use information related to individual Web users and companies is detailed below.

Personal Information

**Web site**  
We use your Internet protocol address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. This site also collects the referring URL for tracking Web traffic referred from other sites. The site does not use cookies.

**Email Links**  
We use email links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with questions or comments pertaining to GeoTrust. We do not sell, lease or license this information with third parties. We read every message we receive and try to reply promptly. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments for the purposes of evaluating how we can improve our site or services, or we may review and discard the information.

We do not associate personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, address, or email address, with non-personally identifiable information (non-PII), such as Internet protocol addresses, to create personal user profiles.

Although we do receive your email address along with your email, no other personal information is collected. We do not send unsolicited emails. 

**Software Applications**  
TrustWatch and TrustAdvisor are two software applications which will soon be available from this Website to subscribers of Safe Market. The information below will apply to these applications.

**TrustWatch™ - A Client-side Software Application**  
A client software application resides on an individual's computer. The following information is collected by TrustWatch: 

  * Source IP - a unique numeric identifier for a networked computer. 
  * Browser type - a program that allows user to access the World Wide Web. 
  * Operating System - the program that runs a computer. 
  * Platform - the underlying hardware or software for a system. For example, the platform might be an Intel 80486 processor running DOS Version 6.0. 
  * Access times - the time when the software application is activated. 
  * Global Unique ID (GUID) - the GUID is not associated with the user's personal information, rather it is associated with a particular Web site session in which the software application is in use. A new GUID is generated every time the software application is activated.



This information is gathered to analyze how people are using the TrustWatch and to assess its performance and make improvements to benefit users. The TRUSTe privacy seal program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software application downloaded from the site.

**Software Application - TrustAdvisor™**  
TrustAdvisor is a Web-based software application used by subscriber companies to disclose information about their company. As part of the TrustAdvisor enrollment process we collect contact information, (name, address, city, state, phone, fax, and email address) on a "Trust Administrator" and other individuals authorized by a subscriber company to participate in our Service. The Trust Administrator will be issued a user name and password in order to view and edit contact information related to the subscriber company

**We obtain permission from individuals prior to collecting information about them. With their permission, we use this information to update them on enhancements to our services and changes to our policies and procedures. We never sell, lease or license their PII to outside parties. We only share an individual's information with outside parties directly related to the operation and delivery of our services.**
