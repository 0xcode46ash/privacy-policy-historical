_Limitations on the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information_

_Notice and Consent_ – We will collect and process information fairly and lawfully, and where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject. The type of notice or consent required will depend on the context and the circumstances, the sensitivity of the personal information, the data subject’s reasonable expectations, and legal requirements.

  * _Specific Purpose_ – We will collect and process personal information only for specified, limited and legitimate purposes.
  * _Limitations on Use_ – We will not process personal information in a manner inconsistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected without first obtaining the data subject’s consent. The type of consent required will depend on the context and the circumstances, the sensitivity of the personal information, the data subject’s reasonable expectations, and legal requirements.
  * _Data Proportionality_ – The personal information we collect will be relevant, adequate and not excessive for the purposes for which it is collected or to which the data subject subsequently consents. 
  * _Direct Marketing_ – We will not use personal information for direct marketing purposes without the data subject’s consent. The data subject’s consent may be express or implied, “opt-out” or “opt-in,” depending on the circumstances and legal requirements. 
  * _Automated Decisions_ – We will not make decisions based solely on automated processing of personal information except as permitted by applicable law. 
  * _Transfers to Third Parties_
    * We will disclose personal information to third parties (including our affiliates) only for purposes consistent with those for which the personal information was originally collected or to which the data subject has subsequently consented. We will take appropriate measures, by contract or otherwise, to provide adequate protection for personal information that is disclosed to a third party. 
    * Before we transfer personal information to a third party to use for its own marketing purposes, we will obtain the data subject’s consent. The data subject’s consent may be express or implied, “opt-out” or “opt-in,” depending on the circumstances and legal requirements. 
    * There may be exceptions to these general rules, depending on applicable law, if, for example, the disclosure is required by court order, to comply with a law, to prevent a crime, to enforce a legal right. 
  * _Transfers to Other Countries_ – We will take appropriate measures, by contract or otherwise, to provide adequate protection for personal information that is transferred from one country to another, including transfers among affiliates. If required by law, we will first obtain the data subject’s consent to the transfer. In such cases, the type of consent required will depend on the context and the circumstances, the sensitivity of the personal information, the data subject’s reasonable expectations, and legal requirements. 

_Management of Personal Information_

  * _Quality_ – We will take appropriate steps to ensure that personal information is accurate and reliable for its intended use and, where necessary for its intended use, kept up-to-date. 
  * _Access_ – We will maintain procedures to give data subjects appropriate access to their personal information and, when appropriate, an effective means to have their personal information corrected or deleted.
  * _Security_ – We will implement reasonable administrative, physical and technological security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, unauthorized use, and unauthorized or accidental destruction, modification or disclosure. We will provide a level of security appropriate to the risks and the sensitivity of the personal information. 
  * _Retention_ – We will not keep personal information in a form that permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to which the data subject has consented, except for legitimate purposes permitted by law, such as regulatory compliance. 

_Accountability and Enforcement_

  * _Accountability_ – We will designate data subjects within GeoLearning to be accountable for compliance with privacy and data protection laws, this policy, and related procedures. 
  * _Enforcement_ – We will provide internal controls for verifying compliance with privacy and data protection laws, this policy, and related procedures.
