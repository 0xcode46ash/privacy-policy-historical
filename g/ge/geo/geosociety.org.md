## GSA Privacy Policy 

The Geological Society of America respects the privacy of users who visit each of the sites within the geosociety.org network. No effort is made to identify individuals without their knowledge. The following policies are in effect for all of the Web pages owned and operated by GSA. (The GSA Network includes all sites listed on the pages linked from the GSA navigation bars at the top and left.)

  * When a visitor requests pages at any geosociety.org site, our Web servers automatically recognize the browser's domain name, and IP address. Our servers do not record e-mail addresses. We collect the domain names and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on what pages users access or visit. This information is collected solely for statistical purposes and is not used to identify individuals
  * From time to time, we ask users to provide their e-mail address or mailing address for the purpose of a survey or to provide additional services (for example, meeting registration). Whenever the identity of a visitor is recorded, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the request before the information is requested. 
  * Cookies:
    * geosociety.org may send a cookie to your computer to collect information solely for statistical purposes on forms for ballotting, registration, membership, or for conducting surveys. It is not used to identify individuals.
    * Online Journals sends the user a cookie that is temporary and only used to enable authorization control for access to restricted material (full-text pages) on this site. This cookie is used for the convenience of the user by eliminating the need for more than one login per browser session. Only information about username and password is stored. GSA does not track other sites the user has visited and no personal or confidential information about the user is ever captured or distributed by GSA. As soon as the user ends the browser session, the information in this cookie is destroyed. 



**E-Newsletter Privacy Policy**

geosociety.org maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your e-mail address will not be sold to a third party if you sign up for one of our e-newsletters or discussion lists.

  * If you sign up for an e-mail newsletter or discussion list at a geosociety.org site, you will receive only the e-mail newsletter or discussion list you have requested. You may receive on occasion an offer to sign up for a new newsletter or discussion list, but you will not receive additional newsletters or discussion list mailings unless you specifically request them.
  * GSA creates targeted e-mailings to our members to notify you of events specific to your region or area of interest. When you sign up for GSA membership, you may choose not to receive these e-mails. You may also have your e-mail address removed from these lists at any time by following the instructions in the e-mails you receive.
