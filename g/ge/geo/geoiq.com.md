# FortiusOne Privacy Policy

FortiusOne Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting FortiusOne, Inc.’s (“FortiusOne”) Internet web sites (collectively, the “Sites”) located at the URL: www.fortiusone.com and www.geoiq.com. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout FortiusOne governing FortiusOne’s use of personally identifiable information collected from users of the Sites and FortiusOne’s general operations.

Although we operate internationally, our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Sites as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Sites you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Privacy Policy Updates   
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, FortiusOne may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, FortiusOne will post its updated Privacy Policy on www.fortiusone.com and/or www.geoiq.com, as applicable, and will use reasonable efforts to include a link to the most current Privacy Policy in any emails that FortiusOne sends to you so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. FortiusOne encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Sites and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

  
Information Collection and Use   
You can generally visit the Sites without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of the Sites and when you provide data to our servers through our GeoIQ services, we may ask you to complete a registration form and invite you to ask us questions, provide us with feedback or request information. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, password, user identification number, and code or screen name that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. In addition, we may transparently collect your Internet protocol (IP) address without your active disclosure. We also may collect the foregoing personally identifiable information about you from the log-in process; registration forms; web site usage; cookies, web bugs or clear gifs; product or service usage; chat or message boards; and communications initiated by us or our users via e-mail, phone or postal mail. We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver requested goods, services or information; provide notices regarding the good or services purchased by you; provide notices regarding goods or services you might want to purchase in the future; and to improve the content and general administration of these Sites and our services.

  
Children's Privacy   
FortiusOne recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. No personally identifiable information is collected by FortiusOne from children under the age of 13 and the Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13. FortiusOne does not target its services or the Sites to children under 13. FortiusOne does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

  
Cookies   
We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall experience of the Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.   
Aggregate Information   
The Sites may track the total number of visitors to the Sites, the number of visitors to each page of the Sites, IP addresses, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.   
Disclosure 

We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and third party service agencies that we may engage to assist us. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to the hosting company who assists us in operating the Sites or to a third party service provider to provide other services for us in regard to the operation of the Sites. Such vendors and third party service agents shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to prevent harm to yourself or others. Additionally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information, in our sole discretion, to law enforcement agencies to assist in any investigation. WE DO NOT SELL YOUR DATA TO ANY THIRD PARTY.

Links to Third Party Sites   
The Sites may provide links to other Web Sites or resources over which FortiusOne does not have control ("External Web Sites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by FortiusOne of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that FortiusOne is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that FortiusOne is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.

  
Security   
We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice, to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. FortiusOne may use password protection and place internal restrictions on who in the company may access your data to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.
