Georgiaâ€™s Own Credit Union is committed to providing you with financial products and services to meet your needs and to help you reach your financial goals. Protecting the privacy of your personal information and using it in a manner consistent with your expectations is also a high priority.

This notice describes our Credit Union's privacy policy and practices concerning the personal information we collect and disclose about our members. It also includes information about the parties who receive personal and sometimes nonpublic information from us as we conduct the business of the Credit Union.

**Categories of Information That We Collect About You and May Disclose**

We collect information about you from the following sources:

1\. Membership application form(s) and other form(s) we use to open your membership share account, other types of accounts at Georgia's Own, such as share draft (checking) and Individual Retirement Accounts, and to obtain loans, credit cards, debit cards, or other services from our Credit Union.

2\. Information created as a result of your being a member of the Credit Union. This includes the account numbers of accounts you have with us as well as information about transactions that have occurred on these accounts or on credit cards or other loans that you may have with us.

3\. Credit reporting agencies.

4\. Other sources to verify the information that you provide on an application. This may be obtained from your current or past employers, or from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions.

5\. Information obtained at your request.

**Categories of Parties to Whom We Disclose Information**

We may disclose any of the information that we collect to parties as described below:

We do not share any nonpublic personal information about you or our former members with third parties except as permitted or required by law, and as necessary for business purposes. For example, we may disclose all of the information that we collect as described above to comply with U.S.tax laws and court orders, State and Federal regulators, or with consumer reporting agencies.

We may also disclose all of the information that we collect as described above to companies that work for us to provide you with products and services such as check printers, data processors, statement printers, credit life and disability insurance providers, plastic card processors, or mortgage processors. These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of the Credit Union, follow your instructions as you authorize, or protect the security of our financial records.

As we strive to meet the financial needs of our members, we may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements so that we may provide competitive products and services to our members. An example would be a company that provides mail services to notify you of Georgia's Own products and services or other special promotions.

To protect our members' privacy, we only work with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of the information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell the information we provide.

**How We Protect Your Information**  
Only our employees or other authorized individuals will have access to nonpublic personal information about you and only to the extent that they have a need for the information. We prohibit our employees or other individuals from giving this information to anyone else in a manner that would violate the law or our privacy policy. We do not provide information about you to anyone else unless we first verify who they are and assure ourselves that they have a legal right to obtain this information. We regularly train our employees to ensure that your information is protected.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also have safeguards in place to protect this information against natural disasters, hazards, or threats. With regard to transactions that take place on the Internet, we have additional security measures in place to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of the information.
