Privacy Policy

  


GE Medical Systems respects the privacy of visitors to its site. This privacy policy is intended to protect an individual's privacy. It explains what type of information we collect from our users on this site and in the course of our relationship, what we do with that information, and how users can update and control the use of information provided on this site. This policy may change from time to time so please check it frequently. 

**What Type of Information Do We Collect?**

You are welcome to browse some portions of the GE Medical Systems web site without becoming a registered user. For some services or areas on the site, we will ask that you register if you have not already done so and provide us with information about you and/or your company such as name, job title, email address, and other types of information which enable us to provide services and information to you. Once we provide you with a user name and password you will be able to access other parts of our site. 

If you order from our online catalog or use other services available through our site, we may ask you to provide further information, including but not limited to financial information, equipment information, and other personal information. We may collect other personal information when you provide comments or participate in surveys. 

If you use our site to enroll in off line educational courses or to take courses on line, we may collect additional course registration information. In addition, for your convenience, GE Medical Systems may collect and maintain your course credit history. 

If you use our online job search program, our Human Resources staff will review and process your application. If no opportunities are available at this time, we may keep your information on file for purposes of identifying future employment opportunities for you at GE Medical Systems. 

If you provide us with personal data about other individuals, please ensure that they are aware of our privacy policy. 

If you participate in any group forums or use other interactive tools (such as message boards or chat rooms) available on or through the GE Medical Systems site, you should use care not to disclose your personal information. In general, such forums may be viewed by others who visit the site. 

When you visit our site, we collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the site. For example, we log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system and CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol address of your originating Internet Service Provider, to bring you the best possible service. We also record search requests and results to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of our search engine. We use your IP address to track your use of the site. 

The GE Medical Systems site uses two types of cookies. "Cookies" are small data files, typically made up of a string of text and numbers, which assign you a unique identifier. A "client cookie" is sent to your browser so that our systems remember your requests and keep track of the pages you view on our site and which services you use. A "server cookie" is maintained on our systems to recognize you when you return to the site. This information allows us to better administer the site and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent; if so, you may limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit our site. 

In addition, GE Medical Systems works with third parties to serve advertisements on our sites. These ads may contain cookies which are maintained or tracked by the ad server or advertiser. GE Medical Systems does not control or have access to the advertiser cookies. 

Finally, we collect aggregate information about the use of our site, such as which pages are most frequently visited, how many visitors we receive daily, and how long visitors stay on each page. 

GE Medical Systems strives to have in place appropriate means to protect your information. However, in providing your information over a public or third party network, you do so at your own risk. 

**How Do We Use The Information We Collect?**

The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is used to facilitate your orders or other activities between us, and to provide you with both general and tailored information about offers, products, services or other useful information from us or others. If you order products or services from us, we may maintain an order history for your account. We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline with the information you have given us online (or vice versa), to provide a more customized experience for you when you deal with us. We use demographic and site usage information collected from visitors to improve the usefulness of our site and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying, information used in marketing, site advertising, or similar activities. 

By visiting our web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of our company we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy, for the purposes identified in our other communications with you, or to provide the information to other General Electric businesses and selected third parties which may be outside your resident jurisdiction. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data. 

As our services evolve, the types of information we collect may change. Please check this policy frequently for the most current explanation of our data practices. 

**With Whom Do We Share Information?**

We do not sell your email address or other identifying information to third parties. We may, however, share your information with companies that are part of the GE Medical Systems family, other General Electric businesses or selected third parties to achieve the purposes identified in this policy, in our other communications with you, or on the site (for example, to provide you additional promotional materials in which you may have an interest). 

We may provide to others the aggregate statistics about our customers' orders or related site activity for purposes of marketing or promotion. 

We may disclose information about you to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of General Electric, GE Medical Systems or others. 

Other companies that provide services on our site, that provide a co-branded version of our site, or that advertise or link on our site, may use cookies or collect other information about you when you go to their site. GE Medical Systems does not control the collection or use of information by these companies. You should contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their collection or use of information about you. 

**Opting Out, Accessing Or Changing Information**

GE Medical Systems maintains customer information, including order history and site usage data, for a length of time appropriate to our business needs. You may contact us to correct or update any personal identifying information which you have submitted to us, or should you have questions about information maintained by us. If you operate in the European Union or other jurisdictions that provide access rights under law, you may access your personal information or have it corrected or updated in accordance with applicable law by contacting us. In some jurisdictions, you may be charged a reasonable fee for access to information. You can opt out of receiving information about non-GE Medical Systems activities, products or services and/or opt out of having your data provided to third parties for marketing purposes by contacting us.
