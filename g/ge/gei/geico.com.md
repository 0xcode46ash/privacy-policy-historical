# Welcome to GEICO DirectÂ®, The Sensible Alternative, Privacy Policy

GEICO respects the fact that your on-line privacy is very important to you. We are continually developing our site with these concerns in mind. You have trusted us with your insurance needs for over 60 years, and it is important to us to maintain a high degree of integrity.  Therefore, GEICO does not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, we hold our employees to strict guidelines when collecting and/or reviewing your personal information. Below we discuss specific issues that may be of concern to you and your family. If you have additional questions after reviewing this policy, please contact us at the addresses provided at the end of this privacy policy statement.

GEICO collects information in three categories when you visit our Web site. GEICO stores information collected by general browsing, when you request a quotation, and when you request policyholder service transactions in a secure environment behind our firewall. GEICO may use your E-mail address from time to time to communicate new services, special offers, and to confirm completion of transactions.

> If you are using a security-enabled web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or better, or Netscape Navigator 2.0 or better, the information you send to us is encrypted. We use an industry standard Secure Socket Layer to allow for encryption of sensitive personal information such as name, address, credit card or bank account information you have been requested to provide on-line.

GEICO places a small text file called a "cookie", on your hard drive to remember certain information. This information will not be shared with anyone outside of GEICO. If you do not wish to receive information via E-mail, you may opt out by providing your name and, if you are a policyholder, your policy number when selecting the following E-mail link:
