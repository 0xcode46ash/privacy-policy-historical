# Privacy Policy - Geisinger Health System

The success of the Geisinger Health System in achieving its mission is critically dependent on maintaining the trust of our patients and all those with whom we interact.

**Security  
**This web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Firewalls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to our systems.
