**About Log Files**

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.

Google AdSense is world's largest , most prestigious and transparent advertising company. The Ads presented on the site are non obtrusive and don't affect your computer adversely. **AdSense can also show you relevant ads based on your interests. By visiting**[ **this link**](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/html/about.html) **you can add your interests so that Google shows you ads based upon your interest, while browsing internet.**

**About Cookies & Web Beacons:** Cookies and web beacons are used by these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) to collect information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. **This does not include your email address, mobile numbers etc. This** _is used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York and showing India specific ads to somebody in India at the same time " ), so You don't need to worry about it._

**What is a Cookie?** A cookie is a small text file containing a string of characters that a website sends your computer. It records information necessary for certain website functions, such as remembering your preferences or settings. _A **cookie will not allow us or any third-party** to learn any personally identifiable information that you have not otherwise disclosed **.** _

**Do All the Major Sites Use Cookies? The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major websites. **Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you change your browser's cookie settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. **What is a Web Beacon?** Web beacons are small strings of HTML code that are placed in a Web page. They are sometimes called “clear GIFs” (Graphics Interchange Format) or “pixel tags.” Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies. DoubleClick uses Web beacons in connection with its products and services, including [ad serving](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx#adserving) and paid search listings (“DART Search”). Because a Web beacon is only 1 pixel high by 1 pixel wide, it appears invisible on your computer screen. 

**What are DoubleClick DART cookies:**

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. **It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.**

Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.**

_**Can this Privacy Policy Change?** Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We expect most such changes will be minor.We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice on the homepage .Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date. _
