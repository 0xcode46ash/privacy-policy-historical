# Grace to You

**GRACE TO YOU PRIVACY POLICY**

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy.

**What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" (IP) address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the gty.org, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site.

We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

**What are cookies?**

From time to time, gty.org may send a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of gty.org you have visited.

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

 **What other information do you request?**

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of providing additional services or information or materials you have requested.

Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy, that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.

In addition, gty.org will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. We do however send an e-mail acknowledgment when you send an e-mail to gty.org, or send a comment through our guestbook.

If you choose to purchase something online, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and card expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

**Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?**

gty.org will disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: 

  * Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on gty.org, 
  * Protect and defend the rights or property of the gty.org, or visitors to gty.org, 
  * Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties, 
  * Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. 

  
gty.org uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. gty.org also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users (see below).  
  
**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**

gty.org contains many links to other Web sites. gty.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. gty.org does not share any of the individual personal information you provide gty.org with the sites to which gty.org links, although gty.org may share aggregate data with such Web sites (such as how many people use our Site).

Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy.  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online—for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere—that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

**Your Consent To This Agreement**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by gty.org as specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
