We use the information we collect from our Site to provide, maintain, protect and improve it and
to protect our users.
When you contact us at privacy@gv.com, we keep a record of your communication to help
solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our
services, such as letting you know about upcoming events, changes or improvements.
We may use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user
experience and the overall quality of our Site.


We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those set out in
this Privacy Policy.
Transfer of personal information
We process personal information on our servers which may involve processing your personal
information on a server located outside the country where you live, including outside the
European Economic Area (EEA). Where personal information is transferred outside the EEA,
we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it is subject to appropriate safeguards
and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Adhesion to the Privacy Shield Frameworks
GV Management Company, L.L.C. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it
adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. We comply with the EU-U.S and Swiss-US Privacy
Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection,
use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and
Switzerland to the United States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in this
Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To
learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view our certification, please visit
https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Accountability for onward transfers
We are responsible and remain liable for the processing of personal information we receive,
under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an
agent on its behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of
personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability
provisions.
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield
Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in
response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
enforcement requirements.
Right of access
You have a legal right to request the personal information about you held by us. On request,
we will provide you with a copy of this information. You also have a right to correct, amend or


delete such personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of
data protection laws and Privacy Shield Principles.
Resolution of Privacy Shield queries and complaint mechanism
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, We commit to resolve complaints about our
collection or use of your personal information. European Economic Area and Swiss individuals
with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at
privacy@gv.com.
We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS. If you do not
receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your
complaint, please contact or visit​ ​https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield​ or to file a
complaint visit ​https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim​. The
services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. As further explained in the Privacy Shield
Principles, a binding arbitration option may also be made available to you in order to address
residual complaints not resolved by any other means.
We commit to cooperate with the EU DPA panel established by the EU data protection
authorities ("EU DPA panel") and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information
Commissioner (as applicable) and to comply with the advice given such EU DPA panel and/or
the Swiss Commissioner (as applicable) with regard to human resources data transferred from
the EU DPA and/or Switzerland to GV Management Company, L.L.C. in the context of the
employment relationship.
Enforcement
GV is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission. GV may be required to share your personal information, including the disclosure
of EU and Swiss personal information, to public authorities and law enforcement agencies in
response to lawful requests, including requests to meet national security and law enforcement
requirements.
Accessing and updating your personal information
We aim to provide you with access to your personal information​. ​If that information is wrong, we
strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we need to keep that
information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information,
we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical
effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice),


risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so free of charge, except
where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain any information we hold and
our Site in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
Information that we share
We do not share personal information with companies, organisations and individuals outside of
GV unless one of the following circumstances applies:
    ●    ​With   your consent
        We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside
        GV when we have your consent to do so.
    ●     ​For  external processing
        We may provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or
        persons to process it for us (or for similar reasons), based on our instructions and in
        compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
        measures.
    ●      ​For legal reasons
        We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside
        GV if we have a belief in good faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the
        information is reasonably necessary to:
               ●   ​meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental
                   request​.
               ●   enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations.
               ●   detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
               ●   protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of GV, our users or the
                   public, as required or permitted by law.
If GV is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the
confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal
information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Information security


We work hard to protect our Site and any information that we hold from unauthorized access or
unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. In particular:
    ●   We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including
        physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
    ●   We restrict access to personal information to GV employees, contractors, service
        providers and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us and
        who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may be disciplined
        or their contract terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
When this Privacy Policy applies
Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered and businesses operated by GV, but
excludes services and businesses that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate
this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered or businesses operated by other
companies or individuals. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other
companies and organisations that advertise our services and that may use cookies, pixel tags
and other technologies.

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this
Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this
