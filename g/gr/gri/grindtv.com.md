GrindTV.com collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. 

GrindTV.com automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, GrindTV.com cookie information, and the pages of videos you request.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

#### GrindTV.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with GrindTV.com under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help GrindTV.com communicate with you about offers from GrindTV.com and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GrindTV.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

We transfer information about you if GrindTV.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GrindTV.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

GrindTV.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

GrindTV.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

GrindTV.com advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 

GrindTV.com works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
