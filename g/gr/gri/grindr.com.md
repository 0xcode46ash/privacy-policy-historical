# Grindr Privacy Policy

Grindr is all about your privacy.  


Grindr is the most private and discreet way to meet guys.  
It won’t leave a trail like other dating sites and social networks.   


Grindr is the most private and discreet way to meet local guys. It uses the GPS technology in your iPhone or BlackBerry and the Wi-Fi in the iPod touch or iPad to determine your exact location and instantly connect you with guys in your area. But it doesn’t leave a trail like other dating sites and social networks.  


You do not have to provide any information about yourself. You can remain 100% anonymous. No photo or any details about yourself are required to start using Grindr. You’ll probably get more responses from local men by including a photo and your stats, but the information you share is totally your choice.  


Grindr does not ask for your email address, require an account registration, or use a complicated validation process. You can start chatting with guys near you in seconds.  


Grindr allows users 18 years and older only.
