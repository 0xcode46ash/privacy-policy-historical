The grid.org member policy  


United Devices' Community Members have placed great trust in us to allow our project applications to run on their systems, and this is a trust we return and foster. We treat our members with the highest level of personal respect: we don't open members up to security risks, unwanted spam, or invasion of privacy. Here is our policy:

Privacy & security  
United Devices assures Members that applications will not damage their systems or invade their privacy in any way. Our agent runs unobtrusively in the computing background and is not invasive. It cannot detect or change any other files or material on Members machines. It can only update project-specific data in its own files.

United Devices Members will always be told what projects they are running. They also will have access to Web pages outlining which organizations are providing the project applications and explaining those projects. Members always have the option of opting out of a project. 

Members will be able to control how much of their system resources are used by United Devices and will be given user preference options on a wide range of factors, including: 

  * Whether the program runs as a screensaver or an application
  * When computation and communication can be done
  * Whether connections should be made automatically
  * Which proxies and firewall settings to use



To protect Member privacy, Members are asked to create a member name when they install the UD Agent. This member name is maintained in the Member profile and used to identify each member on the UD web site and on any scoreboards.

Tracking technology  
We use standard tracking technology on our Web site, commonly known as "cookies," to help us deliver a customized experience to Members. Our Web site will save a small temporary file on your computer only while you are visiting our site; it will be removed when you exit the United Devices Web site. Our primary use for cookies is to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to a Member's machine. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about individual members — we do not.

In order to run our projects, United Devices software automatically detects certain basic information from a Member's machine; this includes info about the Member's processor speed, and set preferences regarding disk space, memory and times to run the projects on the machine. Members will have access to the information about the properties that are measured by the UD Agent and for what purpose this information will be used.

United Devices may provide aggregate member information such as average computing power and geographic dispersion to partners or customers. The information will be released in aggregate form only and, no personally identifiable information will ever be released. Neither United Devices nor our customers can access any other information on a Member computer or identify anything else for which a Member uses his or her computer.

Communications  
United Devices gives Members the opportunity to decide what kind of news and information, if any, they to receive from us. We also let Members change those preferences at any later date.

The United Devices web site provides visitors with e-mail forms to send inquiries to various departments (Sales, Business Development, Public Relations, Events, Suggestions, Member Services and Technical Support). The information provided is only used to answer the inquiry or respond to the request.

The United Devices web site provides members with a feature to send an e-mail message to a friend, telling them about United Devices. The recipients e-mail address is only used for sending the e-mail and is not stored.
