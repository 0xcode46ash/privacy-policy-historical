2) technologically attained information which is collected using “cookies” or web logs to collect information about how GraphicMail is being used by you. Information gather in this way may include date and time of visits, the pages viewed and the time spent at GraphicMail; 

3) account usage information such as the number of ../Site/Images/, lists and templates stored on your account and the frequency and size of your mailings.

4) third party personally identifiable information such as email addresses, names, telephone numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII) provided by our client's. GraphicMail's clients have control over this third party PII which they may use to send their marketing materials. GraphicMail does not use this information for any other purposes.

### What GraphicMail does with the information it gathers and tracks

We may use your personal information, such as your email address, for sending promotions or updates about our company or to contact you with regards to your account if necessary or requested. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time by using the unsubscribe link provided on those mailings.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Tracking your screen resolution and browser type help us understand your needs related to our website presentation.

Monitoring the data stored in your account and volume of emails you send allows us to anticipate product usage and ensure we have sufficient infrastructure in place to provide the expected service for our users.

### With whom GraphicMail shares information it gathers

We will not sell or share any of your personal information or the information stored within your account (such as ../Site/Images/, templates and email addresses) with any third parties for their promotional purposes. We may only disclose such information if required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order. If GraphicMail is involved in a merger, aquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notififed via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We may share aggregate statistics about our customers' reservations and traffic patterns with our partners and suppliers, but no personally identifying information are included in these Reports.

### Security

GraphicMail will follow commonly accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However we cannot guarantee total or absolute security, as no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. As part of our commitment to you, the customer, Quattro Internet Solutions DBA GraphicMail will strive to implement and use any commercially acceptable means accessible to protect your personal information. As such GraphicMail conforms to industry security standards to protect user information from hacking attempts and virus attacks. We use the latest product releases from Microsoft and other companies to make certain our systems always rate well against industry standards. Our software and operating systems are always up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Firewalls are used extensively to protect data by opening only the essential channels to the necessary entities on our servers. This means that if a PC or location does not need access to our servers for our system to function correctly, they will be unable to contact that server. This greatly reduces the chances of hackers being able to infiltrate our system. We use the newest Virus software to scan our servers in real time against any suspicious traffic or files. Virus definition updates occur numerous times per day.

All our software runs on RAID hard drives to prevent downtime in the event of hardware failure. We further protect our data from hardware failure or disaster events by running daily backups.

Upon joining GraphicMail all our employees sign a privacy agreement preventing them from using, disclosing or selling any user information for any purposes other than servicing your accounts.

If you have any questions about the security on our site, you can send us an email at [info@graphicmail.com](mailto:info@graphicmail.com)

### Service Providers

#### Customer Support Online Chat 

GraphicMail contains an online chat service that allows our clients to contact us directly should they have queries of any sort. The chat button is in the GraphicMail website and in each and every GraphicMail account. Our departments are setup so as the following Billing, Support and Sales and operators are assigned to each of these departments. The chat allows us to view information about the client, such as geographic location, which browser they are using, the current web page they are viewing, IP address, country etc. The tool also allows us to build up a knowledgebase and an FAQ section where we receive all correspondence via email. The service is available provided that there is someone signed in and online. 

#### Secure Trading

We use [Secure Trading](http://www.securetrading.com/) to provide payment services. They are online payment gateways which make subscribing and purchasing quick and easy for our clients. Payment details are encrypted and sent to the payment processing gateway. All payments are linked and identified to a transaction ID, but when a client selects to subscribe for a monthly subscription this subscription is identified and linked to a unique ID. This unique ID is used to initiate recurring payment. Within the unique ID the particulars of the client is viewable such as when the subscription - date and time - was made as well as the client name, address, contact no. and number payments made. The information obtained from clients at payment is not stored by GraphicMail. These confidential details [credit card details] are stored only at the Merchant bank (European Merchant Services) therefore GraphicMail does not have access to these details. Secure Trading notifies us of payment failures, warnings and cautionary payments and credit card expires. The link between Secure Trading and GraphicMail will automatically suspend clients when payment has failed and this is done by warning from GraphicMail. Should the client wish to upgrade or down grade their subscription the existing and present unique ID is cancelled and a new unique ID is allocated to the subscription. Clients can cancel at anytime from directly within the account or by an email request to [support@graphicmail.com](mailto:support@graphicmail.com). The uniuqe ID is then cancelled and this will end all recurring payments. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
