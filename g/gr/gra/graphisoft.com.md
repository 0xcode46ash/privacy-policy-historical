# Privacy Policy

| 

We at Graphisoft are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

Graphisoft respects your right to privacy. When you visit graphisoft.com, you may be providing information to Graphisoft on two different levels about your visit: anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site and personal information you knowingly give us. This document lets you know how we handle this information.

## Types of data collection

### Statistics about your visit

As you browse the site, Graphisoft's Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our site
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com")
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our website, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard-drive when you visit their websites. Whenever you request a page from the website which originally sent the cookie, your browser sends the cookie data back to the website so that the website can detect that you have been there before. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track the pages of the websites you've visited. This information is stored in a safe and secure database. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.

### Organizational/personal information you knowingly give us

Within [www.graphisoft.com](http://www.graphisoft.com/), you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to participate in a forum, to receive a newsletter or information about a product, or service or to access special services. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific phone number, email address, organization URL and mailing address.

### Graphisoft registration forms

We encourage all visitors to register with graphisoft.com, although registration is not required. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may always remove your name entirely from databases.

## How we use the information collected

To improve our Web site - information may be collected to help create Web site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly

To respond to user inquiries and requests for information - this includes registrations for newsletters and specific requests for further information

We do not engage in the practice of selling our customer lists or customer information to third parties. However, we do from time to time engage in joint marketing or other similar arrangements with responsible companies, and in the course of such activities may share our customer information with such parties, which sharing may result in communications by such parties to you. This sharing is done solely as a result of our belief that the information communicated to you by such parties will be of interest to you.

Graphisoft has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific Web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please .
