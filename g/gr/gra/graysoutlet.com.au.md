**OO's Commitment to Your Privacy**

OO values our relationship with you. We recognize that you may be concerned about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information that we may collect when you use the oo.com.au website ( **Website** ) or deal with us by telephone, email or letter, or in person. Accordingly, we have implemented this Privacy Policy to inform you of the personal information that we collect from you, how we collect this information, and what we do with it after we collect it. If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [customerservice@oo.com.au](mailto:policy@oo.com.au)

**OO's Commitment to Online Security & Information Security**

Your personal information is treated with the greatest of care. Sensitive payment information such as credit card details are NEVER stored on the Internet with our system. Once you type your information, it is sent instantly, encrypted, directly to our order processing system. We employ the latest 1024-bit encryption technology in all areas of the site which require you to provide payment information. This is done to protect you from unauthorized use of the information you are sending to our server. The Website is registered with site identification authorities to enable your browser to confirm our security identity before any transmission is sent. With this technology, the identity of this site is automatically confirmed behind the scenes prior to the transmission of any sensitive information requested to complete an online order and ensures that your data reaches your intended target or your browser notifies you that the potential receiving site looks suspicious and should be avoided.

Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. The Website encrypts sensitive information wherever OO requests it. OO employs a third party (McAfee Secure) to monitor the security of our web servers to alert us to any weaknesses before hackers find them.  Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

In addition to the steps we take to protect your information online, we also take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information that we collect, hold, use or disclose, in whatever form, is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date. We recommend you notify us if you change your address or contact details as soon as possible. This will help us to maintain your privacy by ensuring that any communications are sent to the correct postal address, email address, or telephone number. This can usually be done online or by contacting us at customerservice@oo.com.au.

We also take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, and to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if we no longer need it for any purpose.

**How do we use your personal information?**

We may disclose information of prospective employees to third party companies to assist us with the recruitment process, such as screening and selection services.

Personal information - We may use and disclose your personal information (in whole or in part, and in identifiable and de-identifiable formats) in order to provide OO services or in relation to any service that is ancillary or necessary to those services, including administration, management, account management, verification and auditing of services and our business, complaints handling, dispute resolution, product and services improvement and development and service support ( **Purpose** ).

Disclosure to third parties - We will only disclose your personal information to third parties for a Purpose and with whom we have entered into an agreement that gives you (or that the law requires to give you) at least the same level of protection to your personal information as OO does. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We may enter into agreements with third parties to whom disclosures may be made who are located outside the country where the information was collected.  If this occurs, and it is practicable to do so, we will update our overseas data transfers list, as required by law, about the location of actual or likely recipients of any personal information held and disclosed by OO.  At present, the only circumstances where personal information is transferred outside Australia is under supplier  arrangements where the goods are held by the vendor offshore, and delivered directly to the purchaser by the vendor once a sale is completed.  Where you buy goods under this type of arrangement (which is identified during the sales process) we send the customer's name and address to the relevant supplier who is responsible for delivery, so they can fulfil the order.  The overseas data transfers list is currently, the United Kingdom, the United States and  Hong Kong.

None of these activities can be carried out on an anonymous basis or pseudonymous basis.

Direct marketing – You consent to OO using or disclosing your personal information for the purposes of direct marketing (including direct marketing by third parties), unless you have requested to opt-out of any direct marketing communications.   These activities cannot be carried out anonymously but may be possible of being carried out on a pseudonymous basis.
