The Graham and Green website ('site') is a UK-based website and is in accordance with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 relating to the personal information you supply on the Site. The Site uses a security system that protects your information from unauthorised use.

Every time you enter an area of the site that has or requires sensitive information such as your credit card details, an icon at the bottom of your browser window will appear that looks like a padlock, indication that the site is secure: 

Another indicator that your page is secure is that the “https” will replace the “http” url. Graham & Green Online uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Private Communications Technology security standards that are supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later and other popular browsers. SSL encodes your personal information and all your transactions are protected by this powerful SSL encryption technology. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, phone number, identification number and password as it travels through the Internet, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than the secure server.
