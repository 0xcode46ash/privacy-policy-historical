In our effort to be transparent with our visitors and to comply with the recent legislation we are providing you with details of how Graham and Green use cookies on this website.

Graham and Green use cookies (small text files) to store information on your computer. Cookies can not harm your computer and we do not store any personally identifiable information such as credit card details. Some of these cookies are required to make our site work, remember what you have placed in your basket, ensure your security when logged into the website and maintain the functions that support your customer journey. We also have performance cookies that help us improve our service by giving us insight into how the site is being used.

We regard these as essential cookies and must be accepted in order to continue use of the website.

**Privacy & Security**

The Graham and Green website ('site') is a UK-based website and is in accordance with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 relating to the personal information you supply on the Site. The Site uses a security system that protects your information from unauthorised use.

Every time you enter an area of the site that has or requires sensitive information such as your credit card details, an icon will appear at the bottom of your browser window that looks like a padlock. This is an indication that the site is secure:

Another indicator that your page is secure is that the “https” will replace the “http” url. Graham & Green Online uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Private Communications Technology security standards that are supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later and other popular browsers. SSL encodes your personal information and all your transactions are protected by this powerful SSL encryption technology. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, phone number, identification number and password as it travels through the Internet, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than the secure server.

We will not sell, distribute or disclose information about you as an individual or your personal usage of the site without your consent or unless required or permitted to do so by law.

We provide links to other sites, which may not be governed by this Privacy Policy.

We would like you to keep the information about you up-to-date. You may change any of the basic information we keep about you at any time by sending us an e-mail to  
[mailorder@grahamandgreen.co.uk](mailto:websupport@grahamandgreen.co.uk) or by going to our mailing list link.

In addition to the information which you supply to us, information and data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files the site can use to recognise repeat users and allow us to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the site for you.

We may monitor customer traffic patterns, site usage and related site information in order to optimise your use of the site and we may give aggregated statistics to a reputable third-party, but these statistics will include no information personally identifying you.

We continually strive to improve our standards of customer care at Graham & Green, and in order to help us with training of new or old members of the call centre team we sometimes monitor and record our incoming calls.

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us on the information below.
