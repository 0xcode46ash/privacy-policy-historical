This policy covers how Grandparents.com treats personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use of our products and services.

**Information Sharing & Disclosure**

Grandparents.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except (a) to provide products or services you request, (b) for offerings to members of the Grandparents.com Grand Deals by marketing partners who execute a confidentiality agreement, or (3) under the following circumstances:

  1. We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of Grandparents.com under confidentiality agreements to provide services in support of the site. These companies may use your personal information to help Grandparents.com communicate with you about offers from Grandparents.com. However, these companies do not have any independent right to use or share this information.
  2. We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal information with third parties about how our users utilize the site and services. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics, such as numbers of Grandparents.com users who live in a particular state or fall within a particular age group. Such aggregate information is gathered from individual Grandparents.com users’ information but is not traceable to any specific identifiable Grandparents.com user.

**Use of Personal Information With Tell-A-Friend Features**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. Grandparents.com does not store this information. It is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail [and tracking the success of our referral program].

Your friend may contact us at [admin@grandparents.com](mailto:admin@grandparents.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Use of Personal Information With Marketing Partners and Promotions**

In instances where Grandparents.com and a marketing partner are offering a special value (i.e., a free gift) to our users, we may share your personal information with such partners. By signing up to receive items through these promotions, you are expressly consenting to Grandparents.com sharing your personal information with such partners and you will become subject to their privacy policies, which may vary from those of Grandparents.com. In the event that you would like to opt-out of receiving offers from these partners, you must do so directly with them. If you have any problems contacting one of our partners, e-mail us at [admin@grandparents.com](mailto:admin@grandparents.com) and we will help you resolve the situation.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and e-mail address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. To unsubscribe, please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section immediately below.

**Newsletter - Choice/Opt-out**

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at [admin@grandparents.com](mailto:admin@grandparents.com). We also offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our Account Settings.

**Use of Personal Information Posted on Forums**

If you use a forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

**Cookies**

Grandparents.com, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Grandparents.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Grandparents.com to present you with custom Web pages. For example, instead of seeing a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your name on it and information about products or services that reflect your interests.

You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of Grandparents.com interactive features, and we hope you will leave them turned on.

In addition to our cookies, Grandparents.com may allow third parties that show advertisements on our site and set and access their own cookies on your computer. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Grandparents.com Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those third parties. However, these third parties do not have access to Grandparents.com cookies.

Grandparents.com also uses Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to allow us to count how many people have visited a certain page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Grandparents.com website. Additionally, we sometimes use Web beacons to access Grandparents.com cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Grandparents.com products and services. A Web beacon is a transparent image placed on a Web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Grandparents.com web site. We may also use Web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Grandparents.com users to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened.

We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

**Third-Party Ad Serving**

We send to your Web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of websites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our Web pages. Because your Web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a Web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women ages 50 to 69) or audience segment (for example, women ages 50 to 69 with 2 or more grandchildren) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience it is trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.

We also use third-party ad servers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to Grandparents.com, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third-party service provider, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

**Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers**

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each ad network's website individually and opt out. Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their website): [24/7 Real Media, Inc](http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/privacy-policy.html) and [aCerno](http://www.imiclk.com/optout.html).

**DART Spotlight Tags**

Grandparents.com uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

**Editing and/or Deleting Account Information & Preferences**

You can edit the information contained in your account at any time by clicking on MY ACCOUNT after logging on to Grandparents.com. You can delete your Grandparents.com account by visiting the ACCOUNT SETTINGS page within your account. Although you account will be deactivated immediately, information provided to us while you were a registered user may remain in back-up storage on our servers indefinitely. Nevertheless, once you delete your account, this information will be inaccessible to the public.

**Confidentiality and Security**

Grandparents.com limits access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need such information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. In addition, Grandparents.com maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

Although Grandparents.com takes your privacy seriously and will take reasonable and customary measures to protect it, we cannot guarantee that there will be no unauthorized use of your personal information.

If you register for the site and services and create a User Account, you will be provided a username and password for such User Account. You acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password as well as any and all activity that occur under your User Account and password. You agree that at the end of each session using the Site and Services, you will exit your User Account. In the event of any unauthorized use of your password and/or User Account, you agree that you will immediately notify Grandparents.com by sending an e-mail to [security@grandparents.com](mailto:security@grandparents.com). Grandparents.com cannot and will not be liable for any and all losses or damages arising from your failure to comply with this Section.

**Third-Party Websites**

From time to time, Grandparents.com may make available to you certain services offered by third parties or may include links to sites operated and controlled by third parties. Those third-party services and sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. Users who choose to visit those third-party sites are advised to review their privacy policies.

**Access to Personal Information**

If at any time you would like to review the personal information we collect about you, just ask. You should send an e-mail to [privacy@grandparents.com](mailto:privacy@grandparents.com) from the e-mail account you used to create your account and we will provide you with a summary, as well as an opportunity to correct and update this information.
