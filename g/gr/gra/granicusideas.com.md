The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to Granicus, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of the site (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from Granicus at any time.

The GovDelivery Communications Cloud only collects personally identifiable information about you to the extent you specifically provide it to us. This includes, for example, the information you provide when you register to receive subscriptions or notices related to a document provided by one of the organizations that we have partnered with.

### Information You Provide When Using GovDelivery

We use this information you share with us:

  * to provide the services you request,
  * to improve the content of the Web site, and
  * for announcements related to new content on the portion of the site you were using when you provided the information.



We never share information gathered through our clients with third parties for promotional purposes.

However, we grant select outside vendors limited and controlled access to this information.  These vendors do not use it for any purpose other than to enhance our ability to deliver services to you and other customers and are bound to keep the information confidential.

In some cases, our client organizations using the GovDelivery Communications Cloud service (such as governmental and public bodies) have ownership of the information and its privacy and use is subject to that client organization’s separate privacy policy.  We will also share this information with outside parties as required by law.

### Other Information About You

In addition to information you provide (e-mail address, password, subscriptions, preferences), Granicus uses technology that lets us know what type of browser you are using, the Web site from which you enter GovDelivery, and which GovDelivery pages you view.
