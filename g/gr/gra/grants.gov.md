# Grants.gov - Privacy

Thank you for visiting Grants.gov and reviewing our privacy policy.

**Our privacy policy is clear:** _We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us._

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

**If you send us personal information:**  
If you choose to provide us with personal information (by providing feedback or by asking a question) we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.

Additionally, no one from Grants.gov will ever ask you for personal information, such as a Social Security number, banking, or credit card information. 

**Site Security**  
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

**Links to Other Sites**  
This website has links to other websites. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

**Links to Grants.gov**  
The Grants.gov link is provided as a public service only. These web pages are provided as a tool to help visitors explore the wide range of options and information available, and to help them make informed choices about how to prepare for and pursue grant application opportunities. As such, the organization, services, advice, or products are not endorsed or guaranteed in any way by Grants.gov and are entirely the responsibility of the sponsor of the site visited. 

**Cookies**

A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computerâ€™s RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. Depending on your browser settings, you may receive notification that a given site is requesting cookie information, possibly with an expiration date. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no date associated with them.
