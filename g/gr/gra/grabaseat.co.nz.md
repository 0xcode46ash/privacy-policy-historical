# Privacy and Security Policy - Cheap Flights, Airfares & Holidays - Air New Zealand Official Site - NZ

Introduction

Air New Zealand is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information you might provide via any Air New Zealand website. This policy explains how we manage personal information and the security precautions taken.

Collection of personal information

Air New Zealand collects information about online customers and other website users, including:

  * personal information provided voluntarily when completing a booking or other online transaction 
  * website usage information through tracking individual website users' click behaviour 
  * aggregated data, measuring traffic to the websites but not relating to you personally



If you choose not to provide personal information when requested, certain services may not be available to you online. Details including your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and frequent flyer membership number may be required in order to process your flight bookings, email registrations or frequent flyer transactions online. Sometimes we may also request additional information. For example, we may ask if you require special assistance or have a special meal preference when travelling. If you do not provide us with this information then we may not be able to meet any such special needs or requests you may have.

Protection of personal information

When you book flights or access your Airpoints information, a secure server is used.   
Air New Zealand uses industry standard data encryption for transmission of any personal information including credit card details you provide online. Known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol, you can check this is active by looking for the padlock symbol on many browsers. SSL allows a secure connection between your web browser and our web server, using a private (or secret) key to encrypt the information.This encryption provides greater consumer protection than many forms of offline credit card payment. 

Air New Zealand makes no warranty in respect of the effectiveness of encryption used and   
Air New Zealand is not responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of the information you provide.

Use of information

Air New Zealand collects personal information for the following purposes:

  * to assist in providing the services you request, including flight bookings 
  * to process any communications you request 
  * internal research 
  * to assist Customs and Immigration officials

  * any other use that you authorise



Disclosure of personal information

Air New Zealand will not sell, or allow third parties access to your information without your approval. However, from time to time Air New Zealand may disclose information collected to:

  * other airlines or travel-related businesses for the purpose of processing your travel arrangements, frequent flyer requests and itinerary requests 

  * insurance providers, if insurance is requested by you

  * government agencies and departments for the purpose of meeting their requirements 

  * communications agencies used to fulfil your communication requests 

  * trusted business partners, provided Air New Zealand has your prior authorisation, to help us process the information for specific projects
