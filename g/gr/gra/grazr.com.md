# Grazr Corp. Privacy Policy

**No Registration Needed:**  
At this time there is no registration necessary to use Grazr, so we do not collect or maintain any personal information about our users. As additional features are added to Grazr, we may need to add a registration process to allow access to these features. This privacy policy will be changed at that time to reflect our use of the information gathered during registration. 

**No Cookies Used:**  
The current version of Grazr does not use cookies during its operation. If cookies are needed in future versions to deliver personalized behaviors, we will add a complete description of their use to this policy page. 

**Server Logs and IP Addresses:**  
The Grazr Web servers record general information about user activity to log files. We use these logs to ensure smooth operation of our servers, and for general website and application maintenance. Our logs may include timestamps, your browser IP address (as it appears to the server), and the feeds you open. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may, however, publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information, such as the number of feeds served over a specific period of time. We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses. 

If you have any questions about our privacy policy please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20061207014358id_/http%3A//grazr.com/contact.html).
