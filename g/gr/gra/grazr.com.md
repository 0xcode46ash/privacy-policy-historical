# Grazr Corp. Privacy Policy

## Personal Registration Information

You will be asked to provide certain personal information (such as a user name and email address) when you register an account at the Grazr.com site. This account allows you to upload and edit files on the site. We will not share this personal information with any third parties. 

## Additional Information

Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your name, photo, bio, location, and your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself on the Grazr.com site. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.

## Content Uploaded to Site

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Any lists of feeds or widgets that you create from these lists of feeds that you submit to Grazr.com may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 

## Use of Cookies

When you visit the Grazr.com site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. This is done for users who have chosen to log onto their registered account in order to upload or modify files. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies. If you do so, you will still be able to view the Grazr.com site, but the ability to create or log onto a registered account will be disabled. 

## Server Logs and IP Addresses

The Grazr Web servers record general information about user activity to log files. We use these logs to ensure smooth operation of our servers, and for general website and application maintenance. Our logs may include timestamps, your browser IP address (as it appears to the server), and the feeds you open. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may, however, publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information, such as the number of feeds served over a specific period of time. We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.

## Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

Grazr Corp allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Grazr.com site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Grazr.com site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

## Business Transfers

Grazr Corp may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Security

Grazr Corp is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.

We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

## Changes and Updates

This privacy policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Grazr.com site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any future revisions.

## Date Last Modified

This Privacy Notice was last modified March 31, 2008.
