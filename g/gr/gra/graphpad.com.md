**Your information with GraphPad Software, Inc. is secure.** We will never release your personal information to any other company or agency.

**Online security when placing orders.** When you enter your personal information on our website, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal and/or financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."

If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, or if you're not quite comfortable shopping online, please feel free to place your order with us by telephone at (858) 454-5577.

**Your credit card number is safe.** When you order software online from us, your credit card number is encrypted using state-of-the-art technology so that no one else can read it. Your credit card transaction is cleared in seconds through PayPal, an industry leader in secure online purchasing. Thanks to this encryption, we believe that online ordering is now safer than giving your card number via phone, or handing your card to a waiter in a restaurant. There is no safer way to make a purchase. Only the last four digits of your credit card number are stored in our system.

**No abuse of cookies.** A "cookie" is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We do not use cookies to monitor your web usage or to obtain information from your system.

**License activation and confirmation.**   When you first use GraphPad Prism, activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. Prism will confirm the activation each time you launch it. During activation (and activation confirmation), the software will send information about the software and the device to GraphPad. This information includes the version, the serial number, the Internet protocol address of the device, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the device. We use this information only for license compliance, and for no other purpose.

**You can unsubscribe from our mailings at any time.** If at any time you no longer want to receive information about product upgrades from us, just let us know. You can email sales@graphpad.com or call 858-454-5577 and asked to be removed from our mailing list. Please note that we sometimes mail promotional material to addresses provided by societies and companies, and you may receive these mailings even if you are removed from our mailing list.

**Questions**? If you have any other questions or concerns regarding GraphPad Software's access to or use of your personal information, please write [support@graphpad.com](mailto:support@graphpad.com).
