**11.** _ **Transfers of Personal Data**_

Personal Data is collected and processed in several different countries. To ensure the lawfulness of the transfers of personal data across borders, we rely on decisions from the European Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission.

**12.** _ **Security of Personal data**_

We use commercially reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to protect information within our control against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, destruction, processing or disclosure, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We believe that these measures are reasonably adapted to the nature of the information in our custody.

We limit access to our users’ personal data to only those employees and third parties who reasonably need access to it to perform the activities attached to their job responsibilities.

However, due to the realities of data security, no security system or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% effective or secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any information provided to us or collected by us will not be accessed, hacked, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized parties.

**12.1** _ **Breach of Security**_

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.

**12.2** _ **Lost or Stolen Information**_

You must promptly notify us if your credit, bank, other financial institution information, username, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will assist you in updating your account details.

**13. _Rights of Individuals Located in the European Economic Area_**

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants individuals who are in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) the following rights, with some limitations. Users may contact us, at the address provided in the “How to Contact us” section below, to exercise any of those rights and we will respond with the requested action or information, or will let you know why that right does not apply to you.

**13.1 _Right Not to Provide Consent or to Withdraw Consent_**

We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing conducted based on consent before its withdrawal.

**13.2 _Right of Access_**

You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not we collect or process personal data concerning you and, if this is the case, you have the right to request a copy of such personal data in digital format.

**13.3** _**Right of Rectification**_

You have the right to require that we correct any inaccurate personal data concerning you, and that we complete incomplete personal data.

**13.4  ** _ **Right of Erasure**_

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase personal data concerning you; for example, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected.

**13.5   _Right to Restrict Processing_**

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of the personal data that we have collected about you; for example, where you believe that the personal data that hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held.

**13.6  ** _ **Right to Data Portability**_

In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, and the right to obtain that we transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.

**13.7 _Right to Object to the Processing_**

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data.

**13.8** _ **Right to Object to the Processing for Direct Marketing Purposes**_

You have the right to request that we stop sending you marketing communications.

**13.9 _Right Not to be Subject to Decisions Based Solely on Automated Processing that Produce Legal Effects_**

In certain circumstances, you have the right no to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - that produces legal effects or similarly affects you.

**13.10** _ **Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority**_

You have the right to lodge complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that our processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

**14. _Rights of Users Located in California_**

California requires operators of websites or similar services to make certain disclosures to users who reside in California regarding their rights, specifically:

**14.1  ** _ **Shine the Light**_

Under California law, a business that has an established business relationship with an individual, and has, within the immediately preceding calendar year, disclosed personal data that is primarily used for personal, family or household purposes to third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes, must disclose to its California users, upon request, the identity of any such third party, along with the type of personal data disclosed.

You can contact us to as provided in the “How to Contact Us” section. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a user’s request once during any calendar year.

**14.2  ** _ **Do-Not-Track**_

Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.

In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking, if any. See Section “Your Advertising Choices.”

**15.** _ **Privacy Notice Changes**_
