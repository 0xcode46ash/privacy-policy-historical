##  5\. What We Use Your Information For 

The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal information are to process your orders and deliver boxes, authorise payment, bill you, respond to your inquiries, get in touch with you about other products and promotional offers, recommend products which we think might be of interest to you, and generally maintain the account you hold with us, together with improving our Site and Services. 

### 5.1. Marketing and business development purposes

Apart from using your personal information to process any orders you may place, if you provide us with an email address, it will automatically be entered into our regular email update service. From time to time, we may also contact you by mail with information on special offers or events regarding our products or services or those of trusted third parties that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive updates or marketing information, please change your mailing preferences in the [Preferences](https://web.archive.org/us/account/preferences) page of the "Your Account" section.

If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time the information was collected from you, but subsequently change your mind and no longer wish to receive such information, you may opt out of doing so. If you opt out you may continue to receive information for up to 7 days after the date on which you update your account.

##  7\. Information Sharing and Disclosure 

We are committed to protecting your personal information. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except where: 

  * We are required by law to disclose information to third parties.
  * It is necessary for the performance of our operations e.g. mail delivery, hosting services, protecting us from fraud, and payment of your account.
  * We share your information with trusted third parties who perform services for us in relation to activities such as customer relationship management and product development purposes such as consumer behaviour analysis and improved product targeting.
  * We buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is one of the transferred assets, but would remain subject to the commitments made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy or equivalent.



Where you have referred a new customer to us your first name and first initial of your surname will be shared with the person you referred to us and you agree to that sharing. 

Companies and individuals registered in our Affiliate Program receive aggregate information about customers that they direct to us through links on their Site. No personally identifiable information is provided to affiliate members; the information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for the affiliates program and will not be used for general marketing purposes. 

We also provide analyses of our customers in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties (often known as 'Aggregated Data Analytics'). We do this so that we and our business partners can understand you better, and so we can keep bringing you first-rate services. We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, literal statements made by our customers. At no time, however, will we disclose personal information about specific customers for the purpose of Aggregated Data Analytics. 

Linked websites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our Site. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website we advise you to examine their terms and conditions of use.

##  8\. Security 

We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. 

While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

Your account information is password protected for your privacy and security. You can play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your password used on the Site. We recommend that you change your password from time to time for additional security. Please advise us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. 

Access authorization is granted to key Nature Delivered Inc. staff only. Backups are run to prevent loss of information, and our Internet servers are housed in secure facilities.
