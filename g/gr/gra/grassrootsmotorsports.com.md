# Privacy Policy |

Grassroots Motorsports is a Web site of Motorsport Marketing, Inc. (MMI).     We are committed to ensuring the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers, visitors and partners. As a result, we have developed this privacy policy to advise site users of how personal information collected during a visit may be used. In addition, this privacy policy can assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us.    This privacy policy will be continually assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs, and may be modified to reflect legal, technological and other developments. Any changes will appear at this location. MMI is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by this policy statement.  

### What Information Do We Collect?

**Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide:  **   
Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us who you are. Personal information is collected when you voluntarily enter it into our site. It can include--but is not limited to--your name, e-mail address, location and cars you own. If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may also retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses.

**Aggregate Information:**   
Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides to us that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the Web sites you visited just before and just after our Web site), the date and time of your visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and your type of browser and operating system. When you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log this data for purposes of system administration.   

**Cookies:**  
Each time you access our site, our server may deliver certain customized information to you based on the data stored in your cookies. These cookies do not store personal information. They are used to store your preferences to help the site remember you.  

### How Do We Use This Information?

Information collected about users may be used by MMI to provide advanced features on the site, to provide requested products and services, to perform audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes), and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. Visitors will be given an opportunity to indicate that they do not wish to receive these notifications.   Personally identifiable information will only be collected to the extent that MMI deems reasonably necessary to serve a legitimate business purpose.   From time to time, we may make individual user information available to carefully selected third parties to send you information through e-mail or postal mail about their products or services. When the data is collected, visitors will be given an opportunity to indicate that they do not wish to receive such marketing materials via e-mail or postal mail. MMI retains the right to contact a registered user regarding account status or changes to the registration agreement.   Please be aware that if you disclose personally identifiable information on Web site message boards or in comments or chat areas, that information may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of MMI.    

### How Do We Protect Your Information?

Appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information about our customers and prospects. These safeguards include, but are not limited to, encryption, secure transfer and other technologies.
