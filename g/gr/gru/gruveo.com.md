# Privacy Policy - Gruveo

## Who We Are

Gruveo is a service by Gruveo Ltd., a Slovakia, EU registered company whose mission is to enhance and simplify the way people communicate over the Internet.

## Gruveo Websites and Gruveo Apps

This information is provided to explain our online information practices and the choices you have in the way information is collected on our websites at www.gruveo.com and about.gruveo.com (Gruveo Websites) as well as our applications for Android and iOS (Gruveo Apps). Unless provided otherwise, the information in this Privacy Policy applies to the latest published versions of the Gruveo Websites and the Gruveo Apps.

## Personally Identifiable Information

You do not have to create an account and/or log in to Gruveo to establish calls on anonymous codes as well as call direct ones. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you if you use Gruveo without creating an account.

If you choose to create a Gruveo account, we will ask you to provide your email address to prove account ownership. Your email address will never be shared with any third parties.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to your browser by a website you visit and is stored on your device. Gruveo uses cookies to remember your user interface preferences such as whether you want the text message sound to be enabled. Gruveo also uses cookies to remember your login information if you are logged in. You can disable cookies entirely or on a per-site basis at any time. If you disable cookies on the Gruveo website, you will still be able to use the service.

Third-party tracking and analytics services that we employ may use cookies on their own. Please refer to “Third-Party Tracking and Analytics” below for details.

## Third-Party Tracking and Analytics

### Google Analytics

Gruveo uses Google Analytics to collect usage statistics such as the number of users or the number of calls made over a given time period. Google Analytics’ security and privacy policies are explained [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2838718?hl=en&topic=2790009).

We use Google Analytics with the IP anonymization option enabled across all of the Gruveo Websites and the Gruveo Apps. A technical explanation of IP anonymization in Google Analytics is provided [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en).

### Google Analytics Advertisement Features

We implement Google Analytics Advertisement Features including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show Gruveo ads on sites across the Internet.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Gruveo Websites. We and third-party vendors, including Google, also use the above mentioned cookies together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Gruveo Websites.

### Facebook Pixel

We use a Facebook tracking pixel on the Gruveo Websites. The Facebook pixel allows us to follow the actions of users after they are redirected to the website by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. We are thus able to record the efficacy of our Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes.

With the Facebook pixel, third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from the Gruveo Websites and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.

### Choice / Opt-Out

You can opt out of Google Analytics data collection on the Gruveo Websites by following [these instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881).

You can opt out of the collection and use of information for Facebook ad targeting on [this page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). For additional information about the currently available opt-outs in Google Analytics, please click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or who follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI site and DAA site.

## Logs

We collect server logs to monitor the performance and security of Gruveo as well as to ensure the proper functioning of the service. The characteristics of each type of logs we collect are provided below.

### Web server access logs on www.gruveo.com

  * Kept for a maximum of 31 days
  * No user IP addresses are logged.



### Signaling server logs (connection logs)

  * Kept for a maximum of 31 days
  * All user IP addresses are anonymized by masking the last octet of the IP address
  * Direct codes (i.e. usernames) are not logged to lower the possibility of tracing calls made by logged in users to their username.



### Web server access logs on about.gruveo.com

  * Standard Apache web server logs are kept, which may include IP addresses of the visitors.



## Call Security

### General

All calls on Gruveo are encrypted and, wherever possible, are established directly between the users’ devices using the decentralized peer-to-peer technology. A call may get relayed via one of our TURN servers due to restrictive firewalls, but even in that case the TURN server would not be capable of decrypting the call content. All text messages on Gruveo are relayed in encrypted form via our secure servers.

Unless call recording has been explicitly initiated by a call participant (see below), we do not store any parts of the call content such as audio/video, screenshots, text messages and the like on our servers.

### Call Recording

We offer the call recording feature to the subscribers of our Gruveo Pro plan. A Gruveo Pro user can record the audio and video of any part of a Gruveo call they are participating in for future playback and/or downloading. All call participants are alerted of a recording taking place with a visual indicator that is displayed for the duration of the recording, as well as an audible beep that sounds at the beginning of the recording.

If a recording has been started during a call, the call is re-routed through one of Gruveo’s SFU servers to make the recording possible. In this case, the call content is encrypted in transit to and from the SFU server.

We do not share recorded call content with any third parties, nor do we provide them with access to any call content otherwise.

### Connecting to the Intended User

By nature of how Gruveo works, it is not impossible that you may get connected to a user different from the person you originally intended to connect to. This may happen if the third party connects to Gruveo using your agreed upon anonymous code before your counterpart does. All Gruveo users are thus encouraged to choose longer, non-trivial codes for establishing their calls such as a word followed by a short random number.

## Gruveo Connect Newsletter

You may choose to subscribe to our Gruveo Connect newsletter by providing your email address for subsequent communication. Your email will never be shared with any third parties and you will receive only the type of content for which you signed up. You can unsubscribe at any time. Subscribing to the newsletter is not required to use the Gruveo service.
