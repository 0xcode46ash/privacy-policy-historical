# Privacy Policy - Gruveo

**Who We Are  
**Gruveo is a service by Gruveo Ltd., a Slovakia, EU registered company whose mission is to enhance the way people communicate over the Internet.

**Gruveo Website  
**This information is provided to explain our online information practices and the choices you have in the way information is collected and used on this website.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
Gruveo is an anonymous service and we do not collect any personally identifiable information.

**Google Analytics  
**Gruveo ****uses Google Analytics to collect website usage statistics such as the number of visitors or the number of calls made. Google Analytics’ security and privacy policies are explained[here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2838718?hl=en&topic=2790009). You can opt out of Google Analytics data collection by following [these instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881).

**Cookies  
**A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to your browser by a website you visit and is stored on your device. Gruveo uses cookies to remember your user interface preferences such as whether you want the text message sound to be enabled. You can disable cookies entirely or on a per-site basis at any time. If you disable cookies on the Gruveo website, you will still be able to use the service.

Google Analytics, which we use to collect website usage statistics, uses cookies on their own. Please refer to Google Analytics’ [cookie policy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage#analyticsjs) for details.

**Facebook Pixel**  
We use a Facebook tracking pixel on the content pages of the Gruveo website, which includes all website pages except for https://about.gruveo.com (the homepage) and https://www.gruveo.com/embed/ (the Gruveo embed). The Facebook pixel allows us to follow the actions of users after they are redirected to our website by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. We are thus able to record the efficacy of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes.

With the Facebook pixel, third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from the Gruveo website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. You can opt out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting on [this page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Logs**  
We collect no logs beyond what is required for performance tuning and security monitoring of our servers, as well as improving the Gruveo service. This data does not have any personally identifiable information and is analyzed only statistically.

**Call Security  
**All calls on Gruveo are encrypted and, wherever possible, are made using the decentralized peer-to-peer technology. We do not have access to the call content (including audio/video recordings, screenshots and the like), nor do we provide any third party with such access. A call may get relayed via our servers due to restrictive firewalls, but even in that case we would not be able to decrypt it. All text messages on Gruveo are relayed in encrypted form via our secure servers.

By nature of how Gruveo works, it is not impossible that you may get connected to a user different from the person you originally intended to connect to. This may happen if the third party connects to Gruveo using your agreed upon code before your counterpart does. All Gruveo users are thus encouraged to choose longer, non-trivial codes for establishing their calls such as a word followed by a short random number.

**Gruveo Connect newsletter**  
You may choose to subscribe to our Gruveo Connect newsletter by providing your email address for subsequent communication. Your email will never be shared with any 3rd parties and you will receive only the type of content for which you signed up. You can unsubscribe at any time. Subscribing to the newsletter is not required to use the Gruveo service.
