**We Are Committed To Your Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

If you activate the "Personal Contact Form" in your account to allow other members to contact you via the site, your email address is not disclosed. All members (including moderators and the site owners) are limited to sending _no more than three email messages per hour_ via the site-contact form.

To protect your privacy, posting of email address in comments for forum posts is not permitted.

We do this to protect our members from spammers that may harvest your email address from our site.
