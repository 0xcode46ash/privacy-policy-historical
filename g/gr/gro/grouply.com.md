Grouply Online Privacy Policy (Last Updated: November 14, 2006) 

Grouply takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. This policy covers how we treat the information that we collect and receive. Your accessing and continued use of our websites signifies your explicit consent to these terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change and expand. We will notify you of such changes by posting them on our site. All amendments will be automatically effective 30 days after they are posted. 

Information Collected 

Grouply collects personal information when you register with Grouply and when you use Grouply products or services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Grouply and sign in to use our services, you are not anonymous to us. 

In order for Grouply to provide you with its products and services, you will also need to provide Grouply with your username and password to your online group account(s) that you want to access through Grouply. We will only use your username and password to access your online group account to the extent necessary to provide the Grouply services and will otherwise keep your password confidential. 

Cookies 

Like many websites, Grouply uses cookies to collect anonymous visitor information. A cookie is a small bit of information stored by your browser on your hard drive that is used to identify your computer. Cookies collect information like IP addresses and the name of your operating system and browser software, but they do not collect any personal information. Cookies allow us to better serve you when you visit our website, and maintain the quality of interaction when you return to our website. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. We may let other companies that advertise on our website set and access their cookies on your computer. We may also use web beacons to access Grouply cookies inside and outside our network of websites and in connection with Grouply products and services. 

Children’s Information 

Grouply does not target its websites to children, and we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children without obtaining prior verifiable parental consent. We ask that children have their parents review our Privacy Policy and complete the registration process for their children. If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove their personally identifiable information from our files. 

Use of Information 

We use your personal information for the following general purposes: fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, to customize the advertising and content you see, and to contact you. 

We use anonymous information, such as that pertaining to web pages viewed, to analyze trends, track user’s movements, provide a better website experience and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not use this data in a manner that would identify you personally. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure 

Grouply will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide Grouply products or services that you have requested, when we otherwise have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We provide the information to our trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Grouply under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Grouply communicate with you about offers from Grouply and our marketing partners. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Grouply’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if Grouply is acquired by, reorganized or merged with another company. In such an event, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any such change of control. 



Access to Your Account Information and Preferences 

You have the right and ability to edit your Grouply account information and profile, including your marketing preferences, at any time. You can opt in or out of receiving future marketing communications from any or all of our various product categories and newsletters, or you can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages you receive. We do reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Grouply service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your Grouply account membership, and we do not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those messages. 

Confidentiality and Security 

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information we have collected and to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of any of your personal information.
