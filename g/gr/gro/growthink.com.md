  * We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide you with the best possible products and services;
  * We require outside companies and independent contractors to whom we provide customer information for marketing, servicing or processing purposes to enter into a confidentiality agreement that restricts the use of such information to be used for specific purposes as intended, and prohibits the independent use of such information;
  * We update and test our technology on a regular basis in order to improve the protection of customer information;
  * We have internal procedures that limit access to customer information to only those members who are considered “authorized” personnel.
