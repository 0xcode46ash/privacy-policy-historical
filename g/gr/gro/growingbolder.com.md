# Privacy Policy - Growing Bolder

### We Want Your Trust

Our relationship with you is built on trust. We want you to feel safe and enjoy your experience with Growing Bolder, which includes our network of websites, television, radio, magazines, books, newsletters, motion pictures, and all other related services, digital or otherwise. Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our website, you will not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our website if you choose not to provide certain information. Growing Bolder continually strives to ensure the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information.

### Information Collection and Use by Growing Bolder

Aggregate information on website usage is recorded, and information volunteered by site users including all data submitted is collected and stored. This includes the use of specific services on the Website and/or Service(s) such as performing keyword searches, registering for events, or requesting additional information. We also collect and retain your email address and any other information you provide, when you communicate with us via email. 

We use this information for several purposes, such as to understand more about our audience’s interests, to communicate with you and to give you a better experience when visiting the Growing Bolder Network by personalizing tools, content, services and email messages. Growing Bolder also uses this information to build new services and develop offers that are more relevant and valuable to you.

The information collected by Growing Bolder is used to create aggregated portraits of the Growing Bolder audience, portraits which present anonymous statistical demographic information but no personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand whom the Growing Bolder audience is.

### **Aggregate Information**

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

### IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically

We automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).

Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or mobile application. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.

### Location Data

Some of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo-location data to provide location-related functionality. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.

### Email Communications

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer service. At anytime you may opt out or unsubscribe from receiving email notifications, newsletters, or other such email communication from Growing Bolder.

### Use of Cookies

From time to time we may use “cookie technology” to personalize content and advertisements, provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your zip code) and products or services that reflect your interests.

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie can’t read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Websites. Cookies do not damage your system. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent — however, you must enable cookies from Growing Bolder in order to use most functions on the site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.

### Our Commitment To Data Security

The confidential data you submit is secure. Because your privacy is important to us, we have installed safeguards to secure the credit card information we collect online. Our e-commerce store uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect your online transactions. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, and phone number before they travel over the Internet. We also use additional technologies and measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and ensure appropriate use of this information.

Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access and is never sold, traded or rented for commercial purposes to other organizations except to provide services, information, or products you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or in the following circumstances: (a) in the case of a sale of all of the assets of Growing Bolder, a merger involving Growing Bolder, a sale of assets involving Growing Bolder or a corporate reorganization involving Growing Bolder; and (b) when it is necessary to share information to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected threatening or fraudulent activities, and violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.

### Links

Growing Bolder may contain links to other Websites. Growing Bolder is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. Because we do not control the privacy policies of our business affiliates or any other sites to which we may provide hyperlinks, we recommend you review the privacy policy of the site you are visiting. If you cannot find that site’s privacy policy, or if you are uncertain about the entity to which you are providing your information, you should contact that site directly for more information.

### Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons

To support and enhance the services of Growing Bolder, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers.

When you visit our Site or use our mobile applications or other Services, ad networks and other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties.

Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use other than in connection with the Services.

To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

### Public Areas

Growing Bolder may include a variety of features, such as public forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms, which allow interaction between site users. Growing Bolder does not control the posting of messages, information or files that others may provide through the Site. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to any Public Forums (bulletin boards, chat rooms) that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

Some of your activity on and through Growing Bolder is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the webite or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you.

Please also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, you make your information publicly available. User reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.

Growing Bolder reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, or to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in Growing Bolder sole discretion are objectionable or in violation of the Terms of Use.

### **Is Information About Me Secure?**

We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using techniques reasonably designed to secure the information. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A user is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you and other users by posting a notice on our Website for 30 days.
