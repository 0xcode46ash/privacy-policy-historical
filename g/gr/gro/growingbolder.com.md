Our relationship with you is built on trust. Our policy on privacy is simple and secure. 

  * Any information that you submit to us - address, credit card, age or income - will remain absolutely private. 
  * We will never rent, lend, sell or otherwise distribute your e-mail address, street address or phone number to anyone.
  * We will never send you any promotional material via the postal service.
  * We will never call you with a telemarketing solicitation. ****
  * You will always know when we are collecting personal information, because we only collect personal information when you voluntarily submit it to us through our online forms and questionnaires. ****



Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our websites, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our websites if you choose not to provide certain information. ****

**The Information We Collect**

This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Growing Bolder website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive newsletters or other materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages include: 

  * Name 
  * Address
  * E-mail address 
  * Survey questions 
  * Phone number 
  * Credit card/Debit card information



**How We Use Information**

  * We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

  * We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. 

  * We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We may also use these e-mail addresses to provide order status and order tracking information, and to respond to queries

  * We may use your e-mail address to communicate with you, for example, to notify you of special offers or programs you might find of interest.




We may use non-identifying, generic demographic information to better design our website and share with our advertising agencies. For example, we may tell an advertising agency that x number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that y number of men and z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to personally identify those individuals. 

**Public Forums**

We feature public forums such as message boards where you and other users can communicate with one another.  Any information you share in a public forum such as a chat room, message board, or bulletin board is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. This Policy does not protect you when you use these public forums and provide personal information about yourself. 

**Links**

Our websites may contain links to other websites. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of websites to which we provide. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the website sponsor when linking to other websites.

**A Word On "Cookies"**

From time to time may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of our network you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible.

Our use of "cookie" technology allows us to personalize content and advertisements, provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

Because your privacy is important to us, we have installed safeguards to secure the credit card information we collect online. Our e-commerce site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator/Communicator, and other popular browsers to protect your online transactions. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, and phone number before they travel over the Internet. We also use additional technologies and measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of this information.

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Service Providers**

We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you certain services. For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us deliver our products or services to you. We may also use third parties to process online transactions and credit card payments, provide advertising, marketing and promotional assistance, provide email services, or facilitate our online services (such as message boards, chat rooms, and surveys). In those instances, we may need to share your personal information with them. We require these companies to use your personal information only to provide the particular product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information for any other reason. 

**Other Disclosures**

We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do so by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; to enforce or apply our rights and agreements; or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of 

Growingbolder.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We reserve the right to use or disclose non-personal information in any way we see fit.
