### Can I return a Groupon?

Returns are handled on a case-by-case basis. Within the limits of reason, we'll do what it takes to make you happy. Unless there is something wrong with the purchase, we are generally unable to offer refunds after one week from the purchase date.

If you'd like to discuss returning a Groupon, [email](mailto:groupon@thepoint.com) or call us: (312) 676-5773.

### What if the business for my Groupon closes down?

If anything happens that makes it impossible for you to redeem your Groupon, we'll make sure you get your money back.
