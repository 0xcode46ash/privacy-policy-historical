##  2\. Information We Collect And How We Use It 

###  2.1 Your Grokker Account Information 

When you create an account on the Grokker Service, you will provide information such as your username, password, and email address. 

Your email address and password will be used together so you can securely access and maintain your Grokker account. We also use your email to send you updates about the Grokker Services, communications about your account, and respond to your customer service requests. We do not share your email with the public or with third parties, unless given explicit permission by you. 

###  2.2 Information From Other Sites (Facebook) 

In order to access or enhance certain parts of the Grokker Services, you may choose to link your account from another site (“Third Party Services”) such as Facebook. When you link your Grokker account to any Third Party Services account, you expressly authorize Grokker to receive information that is available through that Third Party Services, according to the authorization process and your privacy settings on that Third Party Services. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Services accounts.

All of the actions you take on Grokker are public, and may be visible to other Grokker users, or published to your linked Third Party Services accounts with your consent. 

###  2.4 Technical Information 

Like almost all web and mobile products, we automatically record a variety of technical information when you use the Grokker Services: 

  * Log Data. Our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products (“log data”), including information that your browser or your mobile app sends. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Grokker, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and actions you take on Grokker. We use this information to provide a version of the Grokker Services that will work in your browser. We also may use this information to diagnose and repair errors, crashes, and bugs so that we can improve the Grokker Services. 
  * Cookies & web beacons. Like many websites, we use “cookies” (a small text file sent to your browser and stored on your device), or similar technologies. We use cookies so that when you re-access Grokker we can automatically log you in or populate the log-in fields for you. You can disable cookies through your browser, however, disabling cookies may limit your ability to use the Grokker Services. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Google), that collect information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile applications.
  * Device Information. We may collect information about the device you’re using Grokker on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. We use this information to determine which devices to support and how to develop the Grokker Services. We also may use this information to diagnose and repair errors, crashes, and bugs so that we can improve the Grokker Services. 
  * Analytics. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features they have visited, which links on the Grokker Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze this information. We use this information to analyze and improve the Grokker Services. We typically use this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. 



###  2.5 Advertising 

On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time across third-party websites or online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Grokker and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors‘ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
