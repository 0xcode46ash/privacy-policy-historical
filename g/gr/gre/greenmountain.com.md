# GreenMountain.com: Privacy Policy

  


At GreenMountain.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy as a customer or visitor to our web site. Green Mountain does not currently sell or exchange personally identifiable information about you with third parties (other than those helping us respond to your request) without giving you the opportunity to opt out. This statement describes our policy regarding information we gather from our web site and how we use it. 

We acquire information concerning usage at our web site through two sources: cookies and information voluntarily provided by you. 

Our web server tracks and collects general information about visits to our site through the use of "cookies." Cookies monitor which areas of our site are highly visited and which are not, allowing us to give you a better web site by letting us track what is useful to you and what is not. Based on this information, we can improve the site, provide you with tailored information, and save your preferences while you're at our site. Cookies are used at many major web sites, and do not give us access to any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, postal/service address, email address, or account number. We do not provide cookie information to any third party other than companies helping us to improve our web site. If you are uncomfortable with our use of cookie technology, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. 

We also collect personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by you, such as when you sign up for one of our products, request further information, or send us an email. This includes your name, postal/service address, telephone number, email address, and account number, as well as the content of the request (such as type of product). We use this information to respond to your request and to contact you about other [Green Mountain] products, services, or events that Green Mountain promotes by itself or together with others and that might be of interest to you. If you would not like us to contact you about other products, services, or events, please send us a request by email and we will not use information gathered at our web site for this purpose. 

We do not currently give out personally identifiable information to third parties, other than those helping us to respond to your request (who have agreed to keep this information confidential) or jointly promoting products, services or events with us; however, third parties who are contacted through us to provide products or services directly to you (such as magazine subscriptions) have their own policies which may differ from ours. We will give out personally identifiable information if necessary in response to a legal requirement, fraud, or threat to the system or any person. We also use this information on an aggregated basis (so that individual information is not known) to understand how to improve our products and services. You have a right to review the personally identifiable information we have gathered and to identify any inaccurate information we have on file. If you would like to review this information, please send us a request by email. Our web site contains links to other sites that you may find useful. These sites will have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by other sites. 

Our policy is subject to change, but no change will be implemented until it is first posted on our site. We will continue to post this policy so that you can know what information we gather and how it is used. Please [email](https://web.archive.org/about_greenmtn/find_us.asp) us or call us at 1-888-246-6730.
