#### A specific policy applies when Greater Giving maintains web pages and processes data on behalf of its clients, in particular, when processing payments through credit cards:

Your personal information will not be shared with anyone other than the client organization and the payment processor to securely process this transaction.

#### The following explains further details on use of supporter information provided to the client organization:

Although Greater Giving consults its client organizations to adhere to standard practices in usage of the data provided, Greater Giving is not responsible for the information practices of its clients. Client organizations may collect information from or about supporters, including personal information. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by a client organization are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from Greater Giving's privacy policy. Greater Giving encourages supporters to review the client organization's privacy policy before providing data.

#### Finally, this policy protects the data owned by each client:

All data collected on behalf of one client is the property of that client organization and will not be shared with third parties except if required for use explicitly authorized by the client organization or if demanded by a court order and except as described below. In particular, credit card information will be forwarded to the payment processor to securely process transactions.

This also means that all supporter contact information of one client is restricted in use to that client even if the same supporter is also participating in another client organization. Separate records will be maintained for each client's supporters and their activities.

Greater Giving reserves the right to use some of the data we collect in aggregate for research, quality assurance, and statistical purposes. All information individually identifying either client organizations or supporters will be removed for the analysis and the results will be reviewed to preserve anonymity before publishing. If a client organization or a supporter provides permission to publish results of their specific activities, then Greater Giving might use those results at its discretion.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy:

We may add new services and features to our web site or update our Privacy Policy. If we revise this Privacy Policy, we will also revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our web site so that you will be up to date on revisions to the policy.
