 **Privacy and confidentiality**

Great-West is committed to respecting the privacy and confidentiality of information it receives, in accordance with Great-West’s [_Privacy Guidelines_](https://web.archive.org/web/20071220195504id_/http://www.greatwestlife.com/001/Home/Legal/ssLINK/5/81/s7_000650?blank), and applicable law. Great-West has established and will continue to maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information. However, you acknowledge and confirm that the Internet is not a secure medium where privacy and confidentiality can be guaranteed and that complete security and confidentiality of transmissions to and from this site over the Internet is not possible at this time. Your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed and you acknowledge that your use of this site (including information you transmit to the site) may be subject to access or manipulation by, or disclosure to, third parties. Without limiting any other disclaimer herein, Great-West and its affiliates shall not be responsible or liable for any damages that you or any other person may suffer in connection with any such breach of privacy, confidentiality or security. 

**Personal information we collect at registration**

Certain Great-West websites require you to register in order to access the site. When you register for access you need to provide a number of pieces of personal information (for example, your name, birthday, postal code, and e-mail address if applicable). This information is used to help provide you with a secure, private, and convenient experience on the site:

**Identity verification:** This information is used to confirm your identity when registering for access to certain Great-West websites. This information is matched against our existing records to enable you to register.

**Communication with Great-West:** If you send Great-West an e-mail through our "Contact Us" feature, the e-mail address you provide at registration will be used to contact you with our reply. If your e-mail address changes, you can always change the e-mail address we have on record on either the "Contact Us" page, or in the "Your Profile" section of the site.

Remember that the security of e-mail communication cannot be guaranteed at this time. Do not send private or confidential information to Great-West via e-mail (e.g., your Social Insurance Number, birthday). Also, Great-West will never send you an e-mail message requesting personal information. Any such request is a fraudulent attempt by scam artists to gain your valuable personal information (a technique known as "phishing"). 

**Forgotten user name or password:** If you forget either your user name or password, it is simple to recover them online by going through our Forgotten User Name or Password services, available from the Sign In page. To confirm your identity before displaying either of these items, we match what you enter against the information collected during the registration process.

What your information will not be used for:

**Marketing from Great-West:** You will not receive any marketing or advertisements from Great-West at the e-mail address you provide during registration.

**Marketing from third parties:** We will never sell your information to any third parties, or share it with any other organization for marketing purposes.

**Tracking:** As is further discussed in the Traffic Analysis section below, we won’t use your personal information to track your personal movement within our website.

 **E-mail security**

The security of e-mail communication cannot be guaranteed at this time. Any person wishing to communicate or send information of a private or confidential nature to Great-West or a third party is encouraged to do so by other means. 

**E-mail fraud**

Be cautious of e-mail and websites purporting to represent a legitimate company and that ask you to provide confidential or financial information. It is not Great-West’s practice to e-mail you to ask you to provide or confirm your PIN, password, or other confidential or financial information, other than as may occur in response to an inquiry from you. If you receive such a request, or have any concern as to the validity of an e-mail from Great-West, a website purporting to be a Great-West website, or our online security, please notify us immediately Please attach any suspicious e-mail in its original form, or in the case of a website please include the URL (address of the website) in your notification.

For information on various types of e-mail fraud please visit the Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada's website at [_www.psepc.gc.ca/prg/le/bs/phish-en.asp_](http://www.psepc.gc.ca/prg/le/bs/phish-en.asp?blank).

Great-West uses only "session" cookies that is to say; cookies placed by Great-West are deleted when you close your browser, further protecting your privacy and security.

 **Traffic analysis**

Great-West collects some limited information about your connection to the Internet. This information includes your computer's IP Address, which is your numerical address on the Internet that lets our servers know where to send the web pages you view. This information is collected to help measure traffic to our site and the performance of our servers, and to help diagnose problems when they arise. This information does not identify you personally, and all site analysis is performed on a strictly anonymous sample of the information collected.
