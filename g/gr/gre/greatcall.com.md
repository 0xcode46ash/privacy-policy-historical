## Privacy Policy

**GreatCall, Inc. Privacy Statement**

GreatCall respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our greatcall.com website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. 

**Disclaimer of endorsement**

References in this Web site to any third-party products, services, processes, hypertext links to third parties or other information by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not necessarily constitute or imply its endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation by GreatCall. Links to other sites on the World Wide Web are provided for your convenience in locating health-related information and services, and these sites are maintained by other organizations over which GreatCall exercises no control. GreatCall expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, accuracy of the information and/or quality of the products or services provided by or advertised on these third-party Web sites. 

This Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We may also make forums, message boards and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas could become public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. 

**Information Collection**  
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish GreatCall to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information. Like many other websites, GreatCall's greatcall.com website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Information" below for more information. 

GreatCall collects personal information when you register with greatcall.com for a greatcall.com client account, when you use certain GreatCall products or services, when you register to participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal information to greatcall.com for any other reason. 

From time to time, GreatCall may receive personal information from commercial vendors and partners as part of an email list purchase. GreatCall only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws. 

**Notice**  
When personal information is collected, we will inform you of the purpose at the point of collection. GreatCall will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled "Information Sharing and Disclosure" below. 

If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within GreatCall or to GreatCall's third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing, market research information or surveys. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. 

**Cookies and Tracking Technology**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of GreatCall's greatcall.com website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. We also use cookies to verify the efficacy of our advertising and online marketing programs, using third party software to analyze the tracking results. The information is viewed in aggregate, meaning your personal information is not used or displayed. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of GreatCall's greatcall.com website if you do so.
