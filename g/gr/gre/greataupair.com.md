### Privacy & Personal Information

InteliMark Enterprises and GreatAupair have a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our members' Personally Identifiable Information.

We offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to GreatAupair, its terms or policies or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices on the website. Your continued use of GreatAupair following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms and Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

We collect personal information from guests and members during the registration and payment processes and, occasionally, at other times. Information collected by GreatAupair is securely stored by physical and electronic means. Data collected by GreatAupair will not be sold or rented on an individual basis to independent third parties without your knowledge or permission. By accepting the GreatAupair Terms of Use, you acknowledge and grant permission to GreatAupair to use your Personal Contact Information as specifically stated under Uses of Personal Contact Information, herein, on GreatAupair and InteliMark’s Childcare Network Affiliate websites.

Search engines may index publicly available information from your profile, such as your first name, that is searchable by anyone on the Internet. Search engines do not have access to any Personal Contact Information contained within the fields of a profile, some of which is available only to paid members of the GreatAupair service. Personal Contact Information is defined as first and last name together, email address, phone number and physical street address. We also collect your credit card number if you make a purchase. With your permission, we will also supplement data through a background check.

### Uses of Personal Contact Information

Paid members may see your first and last name listed on your profile. You have the option of providing your phone number, which you may elect to display or not display to paid members; either families or care providers who are claiming to seek a working relationship with you as a result of your online registration. Your email address is not visible to anyone, except to those whom you directly send an email during the time you have a paid subscription. Your physical address is not revealed on the website. A map showing the location of your city or zip code is available and may be seen by registered users. No representations or warranties are made regarding the legitimacy of the claims of those who have paid for a membership subscription to contact you through GreatAupair's private messaging system which relies on your Personal Contact Information. You are urged to validate the identity of anyone who contacts you and utilize the background check resources available to you through GreatAupair and the Childcare Network before making any commitments or arrangements. We do not sell, share, rent or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. 

The information you provide during registration may also be used to enable us to process, validate and verify services or membership subscription purchases. We may also provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our member base and usage patterns. We may also use aggregated information to develop new features and services to better meet member needs.

Internally we may use aggregated and personally identifiable information to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.

We also may use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as GreatAupair news, updates, promotions, Favorites notifications or FastMatch emails. You may opt out of receiving such automated information services at any time by signing in to your account: click My Account then click Preferences in the sub-navigation menu to select your email preferences.

Users also may post third party personal information, such as name and email for referral purposes. This information is used only for the purposes which it was collected.

We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use.

### Communications from the Site

As part of your registration you are agreeing to receive emails from the site and its members. While you may opt out from receiving certain types of emails such as Favorite Notifications or FastMatch emails, you may cease all emails from the site and its members by deactivating your profile or canceling your account. To deactivate your profile or cancel your account, sign in and click "My Account" and select your desired option under "Account Options". When your account is deactivated or canceled, you will receive an email confirming such action.

We reserve the right to contact any member at any time regarding subscription renewals, profile deactivation, account cancellation and other membership-related problems or questions.

We will occasionally send you information on special services or promotions. You may receive these emails from us as part of your registration.

Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. At the bottom of every Special Offer email, you will find an "Opt-out" link at the bottom, which if clicked, will remove your name from the list of recipients for future mailings of that type. 

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. At the bottom of every Newsletter, you will find an "Opt-out" link at the bottom, which if clicked, will remove your name from the list of recipients for future Newsletters.

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate or cancel your account.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud, or as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by InteliMark Enterprises. Please be aware that we, InteliMark Enterprises, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this website.

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. We also have testimonials and reviews on our site, for which users have given permission to have their personal information posted on this site. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about how we help protect you and your privacy, visit our [Security Center](https://web.archive.org/security_center.htm).

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. InteliMark Enterprises does not store and only uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services. When you sign up for our service, we will share only that specific personal information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

Our website includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. allowing you to share a profile with your FaceBook or Twitter account). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.

### Control of Your Password

You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

### Research

We also may conduct occasional online surveys. If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. Your responses are confidential and will be used for statistical analysis only; no information on an individual's preferences will be shared with any outside organization.

### Cookie Technology

We also employ cookie technology to help members move faster through our site. When a member signs on to GreatAupair we may pass a cookie to that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of entering your user name and password each time a page is requested. Data contained in the cookies is encrypted and is not linked to personal information.

We use a third-party tracking service provided by Google, called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. 

### Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by email.
