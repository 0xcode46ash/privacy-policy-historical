Your email address will not be used for any other purpose and will not be disclosed to a third party. At any time you may request to be removed from our list by contacting us. 

If you complete the online form to volunteer for the Australian Greens, then you will need to provide additional personal information.

We will not use your personal information for any other purpose, nor disclose it to a third party. 

In the case of online donations, we are required by law to collect certain personal information. If your donation is $1,500 or higher, or multiple donations you make total $1,500 or more, then we are required by law to disclose your donation, your name and your address to the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission will then make this information public via its website or physical inspection of its records.
