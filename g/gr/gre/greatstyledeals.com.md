Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we (Like.com) provide this notice explaining our online information practices associated with our web site, Like.com (the "Web Site"), and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

Like any website, we may legally be required to disclose personally identifiable information about you in special circumstances, for instance in response to legal actions, subpoenas, court orders, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, etc.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
