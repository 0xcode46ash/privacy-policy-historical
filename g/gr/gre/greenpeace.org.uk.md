# Privacy policy | Greenpeace UK

We have developed the following policy to help you understand how your personal information will be treated as you engage with us both online and off. Our policy reflects our duties under the [Data Protection Act](http://www.ico.org.uk/) to use information fairly, keep it secure, make sure it is accurate, and keep it up to date.

By signing up to our campaigns or supporting us as a donor, you accept this privacy policy and authorise Greenpeace to collect, store and process your information in the ways explained.

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated. It may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**1\. What information we collect**

We collect the information you give to us by email, via the various forms on the website, over the telephone, face-to-face or by postal mail. Some information is gathered when you join, make a donation, complete an online action or sign up to receive email updates. During these processes, the only information asked for is your name, address, phone and email (plus payment method if you are joining or donating), although we may request other information such as your principal area(s) of interest in order to be able to keep you up to date with the things you’re most interested in. We may use your name and address information to check against commercially available sources such as the BT file that we have the most up to date telephone contact details for you.

When we collect this information on our website, we say:

_“If you sign up, we’ll keep you updated about our campaigns and other ways you can help, by email, post, phone and text. We promise that we’ll never sell or swap your details and you can opt out at any time._ ”

We use similar wording when collecting your information over the telephone, by email, through the post or face-to-face.

**2\. How your information is used**

Greenpeace uses your details for:

We will not sell your information to anyone else and will only share your details with trusted service providers in order to fulfil some of the above services. Where other companies are used to undertake services on our behalf, these activities are carried out under contract in compliance with the Data Protection Act.

Greenpeace uses the information you give us primarily to contact you directly (by post, phone or email) or indirectly through social media and other advertising, with communications that may be of interest to you. We send email updates about our campaigns and you may get communications from your nearest local group about events happening in your area. If you have made a donation, we may also send you information about our campaigns in the post.

Occasionally, we may supplement the information we hold on you with commercially available information, in order to help us target our communications more effectively.

We also use cookies and tracking to help us understand more about how supporters use our site and make improvements:

**Cookies and tracking**

**How cookies work:**

Cookies are small files that are downloaded onto your computer (or your mobile phone) from websites that you visit. Cookies contain information that allows websites to recognise that you have used the site before.

**How we use cookies**

We use cookies, like most websites, to help us provide you with the best experience when you visit our site. Some cookies are crucial to the smooth running of our website – for example our donation pages rely on them. Other cookies allow us to understand (by using tools like Google Analytics) how visitors are interacting with our website, so that we can improve it. Cookies also make it easy for you to share the content on our site with your contacts on Facebook or other social networks.

We also use cookies to ensure that any investments we make in online advertising are as cost-effective as possible, by tracking how well individual adverts perform. These cookies are issued by third party service providers that we have assessed as secure. From time to time, we will display adverts on other websites to people who have visited our website before, and the technology behind these adverts is also based on cookies. These cookies, as with all others we use, do not contain information that can personally identify you.

**Managing cookies**

All browsers allow you to control which cookies you accept and which you delete. You will usually find these settings under the ‘Preferences’ or ‘Tools’ menu of your browser. For more information about cookies, please see [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**3\. How we keep your information secure**

Greenpeace uses industry-standard tools, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers, to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We make every effort to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In addition, we always use a secure connection when collecting personal financial information from you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

We also do everything in our power to protect your information offline, and only authorised personnel can view your data.

All forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol for encryption. Most web browsers (e.g. Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.) support SSL. The link between your web browser and the server is secure if your web browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning https:// (rather than http://).

**4\. How you can access, correct or delete your data**

You can contact us at any time by email, letter or telephone to change or update your details.

At your request we will give you all details of personal information held about you by Greenpeace, once identity has been satisfactorily verified. Incorrect information will be deleted or amended promptly. We will give you confirmation of corrections and deletions. We can only accept these requests if sent by email or letter, after which we will take further steps to confirm your identity before releasing data. We will respond to these requests within 20 working days, unless there are exceptional circumstances, and even then we will let you know what is happening with your request. Please note that we reserve the right to charge a fee of £10 for any such request to offset costs incurred.

**5\. How you can opt out of receiving messages from Greenpeace UK**

You can unsubscribe from receiving emails from us at any time, using the unsubscribe function on the email.

If you do not wish to receive postal communications or phone calls from us, please contact us asking us not to contact you in this way in future.

**6\. How Greenpeace UK protects children’s privacy**

The safety of children is very important to us. No information should be submitted or posted to Greenpeace by children under the age of 13 without prior parental/guardian consent. All applicable laws are followed with respect to data collection from children. Where we have date of birth information, we will not share data collected from children with any third parties at any time under any circumstances.

NB: parents/guardians should be aware that owing to the nature of our investigations, images posted on the Greenpeace website may be considered unsuitable for children under the age of 13 (e.g. photographs of dead or dying animals).

If you are aged under 13, please ensure you obtain your parent/guardian’s consent before sending any personal information to this website.

**7\. How you can find out more about your rights under the Data Protection Act**

The collection and use of personal information on this site is in accordance with the [Data Protection Act](http://www.ico.org.uk/). Please visit the Information Commissioner’s Office for further information about this Act at: [ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/).
