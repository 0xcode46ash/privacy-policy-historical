# Our Privacy Policy Explains How Great Western Bank is Dedicated to Protecting Your Privacy

## Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to Great Western Bank. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. In order to provide our customers with a broad range of financial products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible, we use technology and internal controls to manage and maintain customer information. The following policy serves as a standard for all Great Western Bank employees for collection, use, retention and security of nonpublic personal information.

### Information We Collect

We may collect “nonpublic personal information” about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others
  * Information we receive from third parties such as consumer reporting agencies
  * When you send us an e-mail, we will retain your e-mail address, the content of the e-mail, and our response to better serve you and assist us with any follow-up questions 



“Nonpublic personal information” is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes your account balance, payment history, overdraft history, etc.

### Information We Disclose

We do not disclose any information you might consider to be private to nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law, such as reports to credit bureaus or responses to subpoenas.

We are permitted under law to share information about our experiences or transaction experience with you or your account to our affiliates. We also may share the following nonpublic personal information with our affiliated companies:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, assets and income
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency, such as credit worthiness and credit history



_An affiliate is a company we own or control, or a company that owns or controls us. Our affiliate companies comprise the bank’s family of companies._

### Benefits of Sharing Information

The benefit of sharing information is to inform you of products or services available within our family of companies that may be beneficial to you in achieving financial goals.

If you prefer that we not share your information with our affiliated companies, you may direct us not to share information except as permitted by law. To “opt out” of information sharing with our affiliates, call us at 1-888-620-2265 to request an opt out form.

Note: Exercising your right to opt out may result in you not being informed about special products and savings available within our family of companies.

If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

### Safeguarding Customer Information

We also take steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
