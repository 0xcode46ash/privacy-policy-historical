### Overall Privacy Commitment 

**Greenfield Online** is a full-service marketing research provider that maintains large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number one priority. All of our research studies report aggregate information, that is, information about groups—not individuals. Individual information is never reviewed or published, as it is irrelevant to our research. All individual information provided is held strictly confidential. 

### The Information We Gather

To become a panel member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from **Greenfield Online** will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name, address, city, state, and Zip) is also used to establish your free personal **iGain** account, which is set up automatically upon registering with **Greenfield Online**. **iGain** is a benefit for our members and is a way to easily accumulate your earnings. Your mailing address (street address, city, state, and Zip) is required by **iGain** in order to send you your earnings. **iGain** does not use your personal information for any other reason but to establish your account. 

If you take a survey or provide us with personal information without being a member of our panel, the only personally identifiable information we will preserve is your email address. We do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are entitled to an incentive and to limit the number of times that you are eligible to take a survey. Unless you elect to become a member of the **Greenfield Online** panel, we will not contact you for any reason other than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or regulation. 

### Use of This Information 

If you are a member of the **Greenfield Online** panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you aware of this opportunity.
