### Overall Privacy Commitment

Greenfield Online is a professional research company that maintains large online consumer panels.  You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number one priority.   All of our research studies report aggregate information, that is, information about groups—not individuals.   Individual information is never reviewed or published as it is irrelevant to our research.   All individual information provided is held strictly confidential. 
    
    
     

### The Information We Gather

We ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers some personal and some general consumer information.   We ask for your email address so that we can send you an email invitation to participate in our upcoming surveys.   The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects.   Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups.   We ask for your email address as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects.   All email contact from Greenfield Online will be sent to your primary email address. 
    
    
     

### Use of This Information

Your information is stored in our proprietary database so we may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific research studies.   If we think your profile makes you a potential candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you aware of this opportunity.   Again, your profile information is highly confidential and will be used only by Greenfield Online to email you concerning our studies, newsletters, and winner notifications. 
    
    
     

### The Use of Cookies on Our Site

Our site does use cookies on the registration and survey forms for technical purposes only.  We do not store or retain your cookie information in any way following the entry of these forms.
