## Information we gather

  


  1. Login credentials \- When you sign up for Greplin, we ask you for your email address and a password. We use this information for the purpose of ensuring only you have access to your account.
  2. Third party authentication \- When you add an account to Greplin, we use a technology called OAuth to authorize Greplin to access that account. OAuth is a secure protocol that gives us access to your data without actually giving us your password. You can revoke OAuth access either within Greplin or within the third party account. When OAuth is not available for accessing a third party account, we will securely store passwords for those accounts. Users may revoke access at any time and Greplin will completely delete all records of the password.
  3. Third party data \- For each of the accounts you authorize Greplin to access, we create an index of data from that account. This allows us to provide search functionality for your data. Data collected may include social network activity, email messages, documents, location information, calendar entries, and contacts. Social network data may include information you have entered on that site including your age, city, hobbies, etc.
  4. Cookies \- We send HTTP cookies to your browser or device to keep you logged in, when you choose. We also use cookies to better understand how users interact with Greplin.

We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Greplin only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party. We encourage you to review Google Analytics privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy.html
  6. Log and session information \- When you use Greplin, we record logs of your visit. This information may include your IP address, cookies as discussed above, the current date and time, pages you request, your browser type, and your chosen language. We never link this information to any personally identifiable information such as your email, name, or any other information that could be used to identify you. This data is used in aggregate to improve the quality of our site and to track usage trends.
