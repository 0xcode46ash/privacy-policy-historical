This Privacy Policy was last updated: **March 1, 2010**

Greystar (referred to herein as "Greystar" "we," "us," or "our" herein) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individual-specific information ("Information") collected about our residents and prospective residents (referred to as "Residents," "you" or "your"). This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how you can correct or change it. It is our intention to give you as much control over your personal data as possible to preserve your privacy, while still allowing us to utilize that Information in the course of our business to provide you a valuable service and hopefully to have you as a new resident of our facility. 

**Information Collection**

_Usage Tracking: Use of IP Addresses_

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet. Web servers, the main computers that serve up web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Greystar Software collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, reporting aggregated information, and to audit the use of our site. When Residents request pages from the Greystar site, our servers log the Residents' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, residents or others from potential harm. 

_Use of "Cookies"_

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you'll find them at most major websites. By showing how and when Residents use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies only to provide services better tailored to our Residents' needs. 

**Sharing**

As a general rule, Greystar will not disclose personal Information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. 

Greystar may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Greystar Software's Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Greystar's rights or property, other Greystar Residents, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Greystar may also disclose or access account Information when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain the quality of our service and to improve our products and services. 

**Third-Party Site Links**

You should be aware that when you are on Greystar’s website you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Greystar, which take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a search result, the "click" may take you off the Greystar site. These other sites may include sites of other advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use their logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to Residents collect data or solicit information. Greystar Software does not control such sites, and, therefore, is not responsible for their content. Greystar’s inclusion of hyperlinks to any other sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites, nor any association with their operators. Greystar Software's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond our control. 

Remember that whenever you give out Information online, that Information may be collected and used by people you don't know. While Greystar strives to protect your Customer Information and therein your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any Information you disclose online and you therefore disclose such Information at your own risk. 

**Securing Information**

_Encryption_

We have put in place encryption software, which fully encrypts or distorts all data you submit to us through the use of the Online Rental Application ("Items"). This encryption will be processed at 256 bits, making it a difficult code to hack into without the appropriate decoding software. Your personal data is immediately encrypted as you send it to us, and we then decode the encrypted data and use the converted data to process the aforementioned Items. We also work very hard to ensure that our employees are aware of the sensitivity of the data submitted to us and that they handle it with care, being careful not to allow any improper access by third parties. 

Because the security of all Information associated with our residents is of utmost concern to us, we periodically review and improve our security and privacy policies as necessary when new technology becomes available. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your Information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Information, Greystar Software can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us online, and you, therefore, do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your Information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers, and our encryption techniques, as well. It is important, however, to remember that, despite these state of the art precautions, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. 

**Acceptance of these Terms**

By using this site, or providing information to us, you signify your agreement to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use this site. In addition, your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will also signify your acceptance of those changes.
