# Privacy Policy | Greentech Media

Greentech Media, Inc. ("Greentech") is committed to your privacy. This notice describes our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to inform you of how we collect, use and share the information we may collect about you from www.greentechmedia.com (known as the "Site"). Please note that by visiting the Site, you are expressly agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We designed our Site to that you can generally visit the Site without revealing any of your personal information. However, for you to receive the maximum benefits our Site can provide, such as purchasing products, registering to subscribe to one of our newsletters or participating on the message boards, we may request that you provide us with certain information that is personally identifiable. We will only collect such information based on affirmative actions by you to provide us with the requested information.

## Collecting Information

Greentech may collect information from you in the following ways:

  1. User-supplied information: Our registration process requires your name, company and e-mail address. If you are making a purchase through our website, we may require additional information to complete the transaction, including name, mailing address, email address, phone number, account password, personal preferences relating to the product, your credit card number and expiration date or other financial information necessary for the transaction (collectively "Personal Information").
  2. Cookies: Our Site uses "cookies," small files that are sent to your browser and stored on your hard drive. A cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information, but it does enable Greentech to record how and when you use the Site.
  3. Third Party Information: Greentech may use both internal and external advertising systems to display ads on the Site. The external advertising systems are solely controlled by our advertising partners and may contain cookies or other information-gathering abilities. Greentech has no access to or control of any information obtained by these advertisers. Use of Information.



We may use any personally identifiable information you provide at your option only to:

  1. Provide you with information about Greentech's products, services, news and events that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we may provide this information to third parties who wish to inform you about their products, services, news and events that they believe may be of interest to you. While we may tell you about these other parties, it is entirely your choice whether or not to contact them. We will not share your personally identifiable information with other parties without your prior consent. If you choose to contact any third party, your communication with them will be governed by their privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. At any time, you may opt out of receiving information about Greentech or other parties by changing your registration profile. 
  2. Confirm and process sales transactions to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond to your customer-service inquiries. For your protection, we do not store or provide access to any of your credit card information. However, please note that our system may store the last four digits of your credit card for reference purposes only.
  3. Predict and respond to your needs by aggregating our users' information and tracking user trends. Although we do share this aggregated information with other users and third parties, it will not personally identify you.



## Transfer

Greentech may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Greentech's assets or stock in Greentech's line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.

## Security

All Personal Information provided by you on this Site is protected by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your Personal Information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Greentech.

## Exclusion

Because Greentech cannot predict, control or be responsible for information you choose to tell us or others in a publicly available fashion, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you voluntarily disclose to Greentech, our partners, our customers or any other third party via chat rooms, bulletin boards or otherwise where Greentech did not expressly ask you for such information.

## Access by Our Employees

Greentech uses good-faith efforts to limit our employees' access to your personally identifiable information to the amount reasonably required to provide prompt, high-quality service.

## Update Your Profile

Please help us to provide you with the highest quality and most efficient service by ensuring that your registration profile is current and complete. To edit your profile, visit our website and go to the appropriate page that enables site users to edit profile information.

Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Greentech may need to update this privacy policy from time to time. If so, Greentech will post its updated policy at www.greentechmedia.com sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of any such changes. Greentech encourages you to review our Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
