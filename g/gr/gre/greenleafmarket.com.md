Our goal when collecting information is to provide users with a convenient, efficient, and safe experience. You agree that your personal information may be used to provide the services you request, provide customer support, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, collect fees, prevent illegal activities, enforce the User Agreement, and improve our services.

### Access

* * *

Personal information may be disclosed in response to legal requirements, enforcement of the User Agreement and the Site policies, or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Personal information may also be disclosed to law enforcement or other governmental officials in response to a verified request relating to alleged illegal activity or criminal investigation, service providers who help with business operations such as bill collection, and joint service providers.

### Collection

* * *

You are welcome browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers located in the United States.

We may collect and store the following personal information: 

  * email address, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers; 
  * transactional information based on your activities on the Site (such as buying, selling, products and content you generate or that relates to your account);
  * community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through the Site, and correspondence sent to us: 
  * computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data: other information, including IP address and standard web log information: and 
  * supplemental information from third parties.

  


### Our Disclosure of Your Information

* * *

We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

We may also share your personal information with: 

  * members of our corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services;
  * service providers under contract who help with our business operations; (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards) 
  * other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information; (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service) 
  * law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity; (In such events we will disclose name, city, state, telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints, and listing history.); and
  * other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity.



Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the Community free from wrongdoing, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
