# Greater Union Birch Carroll & Coyle | Privacy Policy

**Privacy Statement**  
GreaterÂ Union Organisation (which includes Greater Union and Birch Carroll & Coyle) is committed to ensuring your personal information is protected. Greater Union Organisation understands and appreciates you are concerned about your privacy and about the confidentiality and security of information we may collect about you. This Privacy Policy Statement is a derivative of the Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL) Privacy Policy Statement, the company which owns Greater Union Organisation. It will explain how we go about treating your personal information. 

In addition to this Privacy Policy Statement, there may also be specific and additional privacy provisions, which apply to our collection and use of your personal information e.g. information provided when entering a competition, subscribing to a newsletter, or participating in a survey. If there is any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy Statement and those specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail. 

**The information we collect about you**  
The types of personal information we collect about you will depend on what services you use or products you acquire. This may include collecting your name and address, your email address, your contact address, credit card details and, where you have the option to comment on our services or products, whatever other information you choose to supply to allow us to provide products and services to you. 

**How we use your information and whom we may disclose it to**  
The information that we collect about you is used to help you access the services or acquire the goods that Greater Union Organisation provides more easily. The information we collect from you is strictly confidential. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease the addresses stored in our databases to any third parties.

We may disclose the personal information, other information or data we collect from you if:

You give us your consent.

You would reasonably expect us to disclose it for another purpose, and that other purpose is related to the purpose specified to you at the time of collection. 

In this way we may use your information to send you out promotional material, which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive any of this material you may simply choose to "unsubscribe" from our mailing lists and no further material will be sent to you.

If you post reviews or comments on the site, you grant AHL and its affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such reviews and comments throughout the world in any media. You also grant AHL and its affiliates and sub licensees the right to use the name that you submit with any review or comment, if any, in connection with such review or comment. 

**Access and Content**  
Any personal information that we collect about customers including email addresses will be kept in a database which is accessible only by those authorised to perform normal daily tasks such as updating addresses and renewing membership. 

**Our Security Procedures**  
Once we receive personal information from you, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, up to date and stored in a secure environment and accessed only by authorised persons. 

**Where cookies fit in**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many websites use them. Cookies are useful for facilitating a user's access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and compile data that can help us improve our services to you.

However, if you do not wish any information to be collected through the use of cookies you can change the functions in most web browsers to deny the cookie feature. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. 

**Contact Information**
