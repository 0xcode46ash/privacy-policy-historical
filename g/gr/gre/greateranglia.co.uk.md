## 4 Where We Store Your Personal Data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

### Part 2 – Cookies

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website.

We use two types of cookie on our website, those which are strictly necessary for the website to operate functionality such as the ticket booking and purchase. And third party cookies from Google which enable us to track website usage and measure how effective our marketing activity is.

## So what is a cookie?

A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on a user's computer hard drive by a website. There are several types of cookie and the most common are often referred to as 'session' cookies. These are used to keep track of information needed by a user as they travel from page to page within a website. These cookies have a short lifetime and expire within a few minutes of the user leaving the website.

Other types of cookies can be used to track internet activity after the user has left a website. These are usually sponsored by organisations external to the website being visited and are generally known as 'third-party' cookies. These usually have a long lifetime with several months being quite common. They are 'harvested' and 'refreshed' whenever the user visits a page where the same or a similar cookie is being used.

## Cookies which are Strictly Necessary

We use the following cookies on this website.

• ASP.NET_SessionId - This is a session cookie and allows for the maintenance of the online basket.

• SecureToken – a session cookie used for the secure maintenance of a signed-in customer.

## Third party cookies

We also use Google’s cookies for analytics and for conversion tracking.

The cookies set by Google are as follows:

• __utma 

This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit to our site from that web browser. If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits your site, a new __utma cookie is written with a different unique ID. This cookie is used to determine unique visitors to our site and it is updated with each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure. This cookie expires 2 years from set/update.

• __utmb 

This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session on our site. When a user views a page on our site, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on our site, this cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on our site for longer than 30 minutes.

• Google Conversion tracking 

The conversion tracking cookie is set on your browser only when you click an ad delivered by Google where the advertiser has opted in to conversion tracking. These cookies expire within 30 days and do not contain information that can identify you personally. If this cookie has not yet expired when you visit certain pages of the advertiser’s website, Google and the advertiser will be able to tell that you clicked the ad and proceeded to that page. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can be tracked across advertiser websites. If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain.

• DoubleClick tracking

We use the Google DoubleClick cookie to allow us to implement Google Display Network impression reporting which reports display advertisement impressions, other uses of ad services and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services which are related to visits to [www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk](http://www.abelliogreateranglia.co.uk/ "Opens in a new window"). We also have implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting which reports 3rd-party audience data (such as anonymised age, gender and interests) within Google Analytics. You can manage how Google manages this information and "opt out" from data collection at [Google Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.co.uk/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCgnUQZvS9OFBfwzbqk0ldNI8NteUvY1mgQuIoADRUAAl-o6zpFKn2zmluxG2XWwR1hpyNmXP3ngsjRjwLuf3JmOabNrmaDdDwCMjPgt_0CPiRkNDoVH-2edAQlkftHbWXwFv7W8vdUdJDDXSOJ_jWZE6E8wvDVPIvnK__5tVtNQEkvMgDM "Opens in a new window").

## Why do we need to use these cookies?

We use the information we obtain from our cookies for the following:

• Website usage and analytics

• To track your journey from page to page to enable the booking and payment process to function

• Tracking purchases to measure the effectiveness of search and marketing campaigns

## Blocking and deleting

Internet browsers normally accept cookies by default; however, it is possible to set a browser to reject cookies. If this is done it is important not to exclude the benign and useful session cookies. Choose an option that rejects all third-party cookies.

Please note that this may impact on the usability of ours and other websites.

## Smartcard

For some bookings we allow your ticket to be delivered to your Smartcard. 

If you are using an existing Smartcard you must ensure that you correctly enter your Smartcard reference number - we cannot amend this after payment has occurred. 

You must carry your Smartcard with you when you travel. 

You must ensure that you validate your Smartcard at the start and end of your journey by using either the stand alone validators or ticket barriers as applicable. 

Some train companies apply additional restrictions to the use of Smartcards - you must note any additional restrictions notified during the booking process.
