**Collection and use of players' IP addresses**  
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. Web servers - the big computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

GreatDayGames.com collects IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, anonymously track players' movements on our site, and to gather broad demographic information for statistical purposes. When guests request pages from the Site, our servers log those guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information, so that while a player's session will be logged, the player remains anonymous - to us, and to anyone else. 

We use IP addresses in only a few types of situations. We may use these addresses to identify a player when it's necessary to enforce compliance with our policies or terms of service, or to protect our service, Site, customers or others. We may also use these addresses to capture time stamps so that we can determine peak and off-peak load times. These addresses may also be used to determine browser type for demographic information. GreatDayGames.com also may be required to disclose IP address information when required in legal proceedings or by law enforcement agencies.

By using the Site, you indicate your agreement with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, then do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy via email or by posting a prominent notice on the Site stating that the privacy policy has been updated. We will give you an opportunity to "opt out" of having your information collected and used pursuant to this materially different privacy policy. Also, we encourage you to review this privacy policy on a regular basis.
