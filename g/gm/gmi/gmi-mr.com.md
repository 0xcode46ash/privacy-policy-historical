# Privacy Policy - Lightspeed GMI

## Privacy Policy

We have created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our practices for the collection and use of information solely in connection with the web site and service located at www.lightspeedgmi.com (the “Service”). By using or accessing the Service, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE. THIS SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF USE.

Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information: When using the Service, in order to register to utilize some of the services you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to upload, certain personally identifiable information about yourself (“PII”). PII can include your name, email address and login information for your social networking services.

In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as your usage of the Service, IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, personal computer setting and other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual (“Non-PII”).

Information Usage: Unless disclosed otherwise at the time of collection or in this privacy policy, we do not share any PII you submit through the Service with any unaffiliated third party, unless it is necessary to respond to your questions, provide the service you have requested or to comply with applicable law. This may include providing your PII to our contractors who are performing services on our behalf. We will never sell your PII to any third party not affiliated with Lightspeed GMI without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger, in whole or in part, of Lightspeed GMI, its assets or the division responsible for such Services.

We may use your PII to contact you directly about products and services which we believe may be of interest to you.

We may use Non-PII to improve and enhance your experience on the Service and for our research activities. For example, we may share Non-PII with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any PII.

You should be aware that PII which you voluntarily include and transmit online in public forums may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your PII, and by using the Service you assume the risk that such PII provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose PII and non-PII we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Terms Of Use, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.

Cookies: “Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for these purposes. We may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs and similar technology to customize your visit to the Service and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our Service. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. We do not use cookies to automatically retrieve PII from your computer without your knowledge.

Security Practices: The security of your PII is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us or information stored on the Service or our servers, will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

Message to Parents Regarding Children’s Privacy: Our web sites may attract children younger than 13 years of age. On this page we give you notice of the limited information collected for the activities children may enjoy while visiting our Web sites.

For online games, your child may be asked to submit an invented screen name together with a secret password so that game scores can be recorded and compared to the scores of other players, also identified by screen names. Optional age and gender information may be collected in order to improve the site content.

Your child may be able to send a pre-designed e-mail greeting to a friend through our website. For this activity your child’s first name and e-mail address will be inserted into the greeting, as well as the recipient’s first name and e-mail address, but we will not store this information.

For promotional contests and sweepstakes, we will make one request for the parent’s e-mail address, and first name only of the child in order to contact the parent in case the child is a winner. This information is deleted within a reasonable time period after the winners have been selected and is kept secure during such time. In addition to the above, we may collect tracking information in the aggregate, such as zip codes, in order to measure the interest in our Web site activities.

Our current policy is not to collect any personally identifiable information for which prior parental consent is required under COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). We will update this notice to keep you informed of any changes in our policy.

Changes to policy; Opt-Out Process: We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use PII in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.

We give you the option to remove your PII from our list of active users completely. All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at info@lightspeedresearch.com and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. We are not responsible for removing your PII from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this policy.

United States of America: Our web site is maintained in the United States of America. By using the web site, you authorize the export of PII to the USA and its storage and use as specified in this policy.

Terms of Use: Use of this Service is governed by, and subject to, the Terms of Use. Your use, or access, of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by these provisions.
