### GMAC Internet Privacy Statement

At GMAC, we are committed to educating our employees on consumer privacy issues and legal compliance requirements. All employees who are involved with consumer credit on-line must comply fully with all legal and regulatory requirements that pertain to privacy of consumer credit information. We recognize the importance of protecting the personal information that you share with us on-line, and we would like to tell you how we intend to use this information. 

When you visit our web site, www.gmacfs.com, we may collect and store information on an anonymous basis, such as information about the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at, and the web site you visited before ours. We may also retain the name of your internet service provider. This information about usage patterns gives us ideas for improving our site. 

At various places on our web site, we provide opportunities for you to send us your name, address, and other personal information about yourself. If you choose to send us this type of information, we may store it, and we may use it for market research and marketing purposes, which may include sharing it with other companies in the General Motors family and with our business partners. GMAC does not sell personal information that you give us. 

If you choose to complete all or part of our on-line vehicle credit application, your personal information will be protected during transmission to us by an encryption process developed exclusively for sending data over the internet. Information you give to us in this process may be used to investigate your credit, employment, and income records. As part of the investigation, we may give information to reputable credit reporting agencies. We may also provide information from the application to one or more vehicle dealers you select so that they may contact you to complete the application and vehicle acquisition process.
