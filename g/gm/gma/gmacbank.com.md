  * time and length of your visit,
  * web pages you look at on our sites,
  * web site you visited just before coming to ours, and
  * name of your Internet service provider.



Do You Share My Personal Information?

GMAC Bank contracts with third party service providers who specialize in data processing services to help us serve you better. These companies only have access to the information we obtain from you if it is necessary to provide the services we've contracted with them to provide. For example, we use third party service providers to maintain customer account records, process transactions on your account, and produce account statements. GMAC Bank subjects these third party service providers to a thorough selection process, and they are contractually required to comply with strict standards of confidentiality.

GMAC Bank has established relationships with other parties on the Internet to offer you the benefit of products and services we may not offer directly. These services are optional and not required by us. GMAC Bank offers you access to these other companies either through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our site, or through offering "co–branded" sites in which both GMAC Bank and the other company share the same URL, domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. Generally, we do not own the company we form co–branded relationships with and we do not control how those companies use any information you supply them. Therefore, it's important that you understand their privacy policy if you visit their sites. However, if you are providing information to GMAC Bank, we will always adhere to GMAC Bank's Privacy practices.

We continually improve our security standards and procedures to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information – including your Online Banking transactions. Information that is collected for processing or to keep as a GMAC Bank account record is transmitted directly to secure database servers, and information stored there is not accessible to parties outside of GMAC Bank via the Internet.
