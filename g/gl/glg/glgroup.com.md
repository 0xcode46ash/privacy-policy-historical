If you are a Council Member, you have agreed and are additionally subject to the [Terms and Conditions of Council Membership](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217173415id_/http%3A//www.glgroup.com/tandc.html) in the Gerson Lehrman Group Councils ("Terms and Conditions"), which expressly incorporates this Privacy Policy.
