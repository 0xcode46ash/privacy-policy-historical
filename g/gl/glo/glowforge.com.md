# Privacy Policy - Glowforge - the 3D laser printer

_Effective: Jan 15, 2015 (rev. Aug 18, 2016)_

Welcome to the Glowforge, Inc., Privacy Policy. We are a Delaware Corporation, located in Seattle, Washington. For purposes of this policy, when we say stuff like "We" and "Us," we mean Glowforge, Inc., the Company. When we say stuff like "Website" or "Site," we're talking about our website at http://glowforge.com, or other websites that we may operate like http://glowfor.ge. 

This Privacy Policy applies to any information that is collected while you are on our Website. Our goal with this policy is to be transparent about what information we collect, how and when we use it, and when and whether it is shared. 

By visiting and (we hope!) using our site to make beautiful things, you acknowledge and consent to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or complaints about this policy, we encourage you to send them to [privacy@glowforge.com](mailto:privacy@glowforge.com).

Like many Privacy Policies past, present, and doubtless future, our Privacy Policy explains: 

  * The types of information we collect
  * How we use that information
  * The choices we offer, including how to access or update your own information, and
  * The steps we take to keep your information safe
  * Of course, our Privacy Policy may change, and when it does, we will post the new Policy on our Site. Whenever a user visits the Site, the current version of the Policy applies.



**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

  1. We collect information when you browse the site 

When you visit the Site we collect data, much of which is anonymous. This data includes information such as: the type of browser and OS you use; the time and date that you visit; your IP address and the general geographical location the IP identifies you as being at; the address of the external or internal page that referred you; search terms you might have used to find our site, or if you used an email to access our site, what email you clicked on; and the pages on the site that you visit, possibly including the order of the pages you visit and any actions you take on a given page. We mostly use this information to figure out how people are using our site and what interests them, and we may also use it to diagnose issues with the site.

  2. We Collect Information When You Sign Up 

There are lots of reasons you might give us information:

    * So you can follow us, or so we can put you on a mailing list
    * So you can order something
    * So you can report a problem with something
    * So you can take advantage of our referral program
    * So you can enter a contest
    * So you can apply to a job
    * So you can create an account, for example for the forums,
    * So you can communicate with us via social media, for example our Facebook or Twitter or Instagram account, or
    * To tell us your marketing preferences

For example, there's a box on our homepage that allows you to input your name and email address. No surprise, when you put your name and email in there, we keep them so that we can tell you about our launch and occasional company announcements or promotions.

Once you are on our mailing list, you will remain on the list until you unsubscribe, which you can do at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in every email. Or if you prefer, you can send an email to [privacy@glowforge.com](mailto:privacy@glowforge.com) and we will remove it for you. We use SendGrid to provide email list services, and their privacy policy is here.

In any of the situations we list, we take the relevant information you give us and hold onto it for our records. In so doing, we may store information such as: your name; your email address; your username and password; the name of any referrer; the name of any people referred; your contact information, including any billing or shipping address/es; records of anything you order from us or request from us; and photos or other documents you may submit to us.

If you submit a document or photo, it becomes Glowforge property. If you submit photos to us in any social media context, you thereby grant us permission to use that photo in print or online/electronically for any lawful purposes. Note that if you share information with us on a public social media site, that information may be seen by the general public and any other person or entity might collect and keep that information for their own purposes.

While you may submit credit card information while making a purchase with us, we don't hold onto your full credit card information ourselves â€“ we have you pay by either Stripe or Paypal, and they keep that credit card information in their super-spiffy credit card vaults. We do keep a record of the last 4 digits of the card you used, because that helps us to identify given transactions later. As regards your full credit card number, Stripe's privacy policy is here, and Paypal's privacy policy is here.

We do provide an option to opt out of us (or rather, Stripe) saving your credit card information, if you only want to use that information for one transaction on our website. If you do opt out, we do not keep that information, nor does Stripe. Paypal similarly offers an opt-out for saving your credit card information, if you choose to make a one-time payment through them.

  3. We Collect Information When You Interact with Us on Social Media, or Use Social Media Buttons on our Site 

You may see Facebook "like" buttons or "share" buttons on our website, or similar buttons on our website or other social media sites. If you use those buttons, we may collect your IP address and where you were on our site or on social media when you used the button. These kinds of social media features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them. Here are the policies of a few of those companies:

    * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php)
    * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en)
    * [Instagram](https://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/?hl=en)
    * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines)
    * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)
  4. We Collect Information When You Communicate With Us Directly 

If you email us or send us other communications directly, we will retain your email or address and correspondence so that we may respond to your request. We may retain this information indefinitely so that we have a history of our past communications.One way that you might communicate with us is by applying for a job via our jobs website, which collects information and shares it with us via our partner Lever.co. The Lever.co privacy policy is here. We may share this information with trusted partners, for example while doing a reference check before you join our company.




**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**

We do not rent or sell personally identifiable information to others.

We may share our mailing list with reputable third parties who sell products or services complementary to our own. To opt out, please send an email to [privacy@glowforge.com](mailto:privacy@glowforge.com).

We do share information with our vendors, as described in this policy, for the purposes described in this policy. These vendors are not authorized to use or disclose the information, other than to perform their services for us. For example, as we described above, we share information with MailChimp so that they can operate our mailing list, but they are not authorized to email you directly or share your information with others. The same applies to vendors who operate services for us such as: our forums, our referral program, our job application page, shipping, market research, and payment processing.

Finally, we might also share information in the following specific situations:

  * If we receive your consent to do so;
  * If we believe we have to in order to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are about to release your information, we will try to provide you with notice in advance, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so; and
  * If we are acquired by or merged with another company. This Privacy Policy would continue to apply to any data collected while it was in place.



**DATA SECURITY**

We have adopted commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative procedures to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect on our site. In the event we become aware of a data breach where users' personally identifiable information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties, we will make reasonable efforts to let any affected individuals know if we think there is a reasonable risk of harm to those users or if otherwise required to do so by law.

**SORRY, NO KIDS UNDER 13**

While we hope your kids will get a chance to try the Glowforge, it's not something they should do without adult supervision, and our website is not directed at persons under 13. Consequently, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@glowforge.com](mailto:privacy@glowforge.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with any personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. Any account that is created by a person under 13 will be terminated and any content created will be removed from the Site.

**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

From time to time, this Privacy Policy will be revised. When we make material changes to this policy, we will post them at [https://glowforge.com/privacy-policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy), with a link to them from our homepage.

**COOKIE POLICY**

Some of our data partners, such as Google Analytics, use cookies to help us better understand our website visitors.

What's a cookie?

Cookies are small data files that websites store in your hard drive. They create a unique id that is associated with your browser. We use third-party cookies from Google Analytics to collect information about how you engage with our site so that we can improve it. Google Analytics reports do not identify individual visitors. You may install a Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Button here. Google Analytics also has a Privacy Policy, which can be read . We may use other cookies to maintain login information, or your shopping cart and contents, or your shopping session. You may always disable cookies via your web browser, but be advised it is possible this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of the features on our site. This Privacy Policy does not address cookies by our partners, where their own privacy policies apply.

**PIXEL TAG POLICY**

What's a pixel tag?

Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, conversion pixels, or tracking pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to do things like read and place cookies and transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can include information such as a device's IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, whether a viewer did a particular activity, an identifier associated with the browser or device and the type of browser being used.

We use pixel tags from Facebook, and the information collected is to help us target our ads more effectively. The Facebook Cookie and Pixel Policy is [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Fcookies%2Fupdate&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFIiS5yFH9sVKP8PxR_130eWq-fQQ).

Facebook is part of the Digital Marketing Alliance's "Consumer Choice" Program. That program, located [here](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutads.info%2Fchoices%2F%23completed&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF2pJ12fFRC7NvfFJZuucaGZv_ZfA) for US users, here for Canadian users, and [here](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youronlinechoices.eu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHzimUi0fSHMU4OBsxiEQIPc92N5Q) for EU users, allows you to opt out of many different types of ad tracking, including Facebook's. The Program is managed browser-by-browser, so if you use many different means of browsing the web, you may need to opt out of a given organization's ad tracking that many times. On your mobile device, you also may be able to opt out using its settings.
