 **Information sharing**

We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site in order to describe our services to prospective partners and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the Site, processing donations, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time.  Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.

We may disclose your personal information if required or permitted to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the Site or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.

 **Child safety**

Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us.  We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to the Site or sending personal information to us or anyone else online.

 **External links**

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.

 **Donations processing**

Donations made via the Site are made through one of our payment gateway providers, GoCardless or Stripe (as will be made clear at the point of donation). You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to either GoCardless or Stripe which operate a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.  Information which you supply to either GoCardless or Stripe is not within our control and is subject to GoCardless or Stripe's own privacy policy and terms (as applicable) and which are available on the applicable site.

 **Security**

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users.  We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.  Our security measures and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information.  Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure.  We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

 **Storage of your information**

Information that you submit via the Site will only be stored for as long as we legitimately need it or as required by the law.  This information is sent to and stored on secure servers.  This is necessary in order to process the information.  Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA.  The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.  Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. 

**Your rights**

You have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of certain information about you held by us in relation to data you provide via our Site (e.g. when signing up to our newsletter or making donations). On request, we will provide you with a copy of such information (unless exempt under the 1998 Act) subject to a fee not exceeding the statutory maximum under English law. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
