                                                 Privacy Policy
INFORMATION COLLECTION
GGC Rewards, LLC (referred to herein as “GGC Rewards”, “our”, “us” or “we”) is the sole owner of the
information collected on our websites and on the replicated GGC Rewards websites that we provide for
use by independent contractor Distributors (hereafter the “websites”). We collect information from
Independent Distributors (“Distributors”), customers and visitors to the websites at different points on the
websites.
Personally Identifiable Information
Through your use of or visits to our websites, you may be required or requested to provide personally
identifiable information to us. Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can
potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person including names, addresses,
email addresses, telephone numbers, social security and tax identification numbers, and credit card
information.
Distributor and Customer Registration
In order to become a Distributor, an applicant must provide biographical and contact information (such as
name, mailing address, telephone numbers, and email address) to us. We also require an applicant’s
Social Security Number or Federal Tax ID Number so that we may prepare and file necessary non-
employee compensation forms for the IRS. Certain customers may be required to register in order to
purchase products directly from us (“Registered Customers”). Registered Customers will be required to
provide contact information (such as name, mailing address, telephone number(s), and email address)
and payment information (such as credit card or checking account information). We use this information
to maintain contact with Distributors and Registered Customers, and to process Distributor and
Registered Customer orders.
Downline Genealogy Reports
As a network marketing company, GGC Rewards provides certain information to Distributors regarding
the other Distributors and Registered Customers enrolled in a Distributor’s downline marketing
organization. If you enroll as a Distributor or Registered Customer with GGC Rewards, your name,
address, email address, and telephone number will be provided to your enroller. No other personally
identifiable information will be shared with other Distributors. Such information is made available to GGC
Rewards Distributors subject to a confidentiality and non-disclosure covenant in the agreement that each
Distributor enters into with GGC Rewards.
Product or Service Purchases
When a customer, Registered Customer, or Distributor purchases products or services from us through
any of our websites, the purchaser must provide us with mailing and contact information as well as
payment information. This information is used for billing and payment purposes and to fill orders.
INFORMATION USE
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information that is collected from customers, Distributors and Registered
Customers through Distributor and Customer Registration, Product or Services Purchases and/or


Surveys is used as described above. GGC Rewards DOES NOT share personally identifiable information
except as may be necessary to process and fill an order. GGC Rewards may share aggregated
information from time to time with its partners, vendors or other third parties. When such aggregate
information is shared by GGC Rewards, no personally identifiable information is shared.
Profile Information
GGC Rewards stores information that it collects through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties
to create a profile of visitors to our websites (“users”), including customers, Registered Customers, and
Distributors. A profile is stored information that GGC Rewards keeps on individual users that details their
viewing preferences. Profile information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide
offers and improve the content of the site for the user. GGC Rewards does not share profile information
with other third parties.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a
cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the websites. GGC Rewards
uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the
browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard
drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser
help file directions.
By setting a cookie on a user’s computer, users do not have to log in a password more than once,
thereby saving time while at the websites. If a user rejects the cookie, the user will still be able to use the
site. The only drawback to this is that the user may need to enter his or her password every time he or
she accesses the site.
Log Files
Like most standard website servers GGC Rewards’s websites use log files. This includes internet
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type,
date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the
aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not
linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to
enable our web-based service. We use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
GGC Rewards employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that
help GGC Rewards to better manage content on the websites by informing it what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
online movements of users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the
page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to
users’ personally identifiable information. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable
information.


In addition, GGC Rewards uses clear gifs in its HTML-based emails to let it know which emails have been
opened by the recipients.         This allows GGC Rewards to gauge the effectiveness of certain
communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
COMMUNICATIONS FROM US
Special Offers and Updates
GGC Rewards sends all new Distributors and Registered Customers a welcoming email to verify
password, username, and acceptance of the Distributor Agreement or Customer Agreement. All
Distributors and Registered Customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special
deals, and a newsletter. Customers who have not registered with GGC Rewards and who grant
permission will also receive occasional information on products, services, special deals, and the like.
Service Announcements
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our
service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send Distributors and/or customers an email.
Generally, Distributors may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their
account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
Distributor and Customer Service
GGC Rewards communicates with Distributors and Registered Customers via email, regular mail and
telephone on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their GGC
Rewards business. GGC Rewards communicates with other customers with respect to products or
services purchased by such customers from GGC Rewards. Such communications may be by email,
regular mail or telephone.
SHARING
Legal Disclaimer
Though GGC Rewards makes every effort to preserve user privacy, GGC Rewards may need to disclose
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on GGC
Rewards.
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)
GGC Rewards shares aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not
linked to any personally identifiable information.
These are the instances in which we will share users’ personal information:
GGC Rewards DOES NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information about users with any Third Parties.
Third Party Fulfillment
GGC Rewards uses an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company
to bill Distributors for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.


Service Providers
GGC Rewards partners with other third parties to provide specific services. When necessary to provide
services or products to Distributors, Registered Customers, and other customers, we share names and/or
other contact information with service providers and vendors. Such third parties are not allowed to use
personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
Business Transitions
In the event GGC Rewards goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by
another company, or selling a portion of its assets, the personal information of Distributors and customers
will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, a
Distributor’s or customer’s personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that
stated at the time of collection, the Distributor or customer will be given choice consistent with our
notification of changes section.
Choice
Users are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so
users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require
an outside party.
Links
GGC Rewards’s websites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that GGC Rewards is not
responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage users to be aware when they
leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by GGC Rewards
websites.
Security
GGC Rewards takes every precaution to protect all users’ information. When users submit sensitive
information via GGC Rewards’s websites, their information is protected both online and off-line.
When the Distributor Application, Customer Registration, and/or online order forms ask users to enter
sensitive information (such as Bank Account number and/or social security number), that information is
encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure
page, such as the Distributor Application and Agreement and online order forms, the lock icon on the
bottom of web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as
opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.
While GGC Rewards uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, the Company also does
everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All user information, not just the sensitive
information mentioned above, is restricted in GGC Rewards’s offices. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL
employees are kept up-to-date on Company security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store
personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.
