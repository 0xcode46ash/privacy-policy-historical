# Privacy Policy :: Global Cash Card

At Global Cash Card we recognize that privacy and security of personal financial information is a concern to our customers. We have taken the utmost care in establishing and implementing policies and procedures to protect this information.

## YOUR PRIVACY IS A PRIORITY

We are committed to provide products, services, and offers of value to you and your family. We may use information from our interactions with you and other customers, and from other parties, to help us achieve that goal.

Your privacy is considered in all aspects of our business. Our employees are informed of their responsibility to protect confidential customer information and are governed by a code of conduct that includes this confidentiality. Appropriate disciplinary policies are in place to help enforce employee privacy responsibilities. Security procedures and internal controls are also in place to protect our customers' privacy.

We believe that the basis of each customer relationship is trust. Because you trust us with your personal information, we are committed to respect your privacy and safeguard that information. In order to preserve that trust, we pledge to protect your privacy by adhering to practices intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.  


## WHY WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION

Global Cash Card receives and retains information about its customers through many sources. We limit the use and collection of this information to that which is necessary to maintain and administer financial services, provide excellent service, and offer new products and services that may be of benefit to our customers.  
We gather information about you and your account so we can (a) deliver products and services to meet your needs, (b) know who you are and thereby prevent unauthorized access to your information, (c) design and improve the products we offer, (d) replace a lost card, PIN, or to provide some other form of assistance, and (e) comply with laws and regulations that govern us.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT 

We may collect the following types of "non-public personal information" about you:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms.
  * Information about your transactions with our affiliates or us.
  * Information about your transactions with non-affiliated third parties.



Global Cash Card is committed to fully complying with the laws and regulations, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Right to Financial Privacy Act, that have been established to protect the confidentiality of customer information. If we obtain and use information from a third party such as a consumer report, we will notify you. You are entitled to request credit reporting agencies to remove your name from lists supplied to us.  
Global Cash Card does exchange information about our customers to reputable information reporting agencies, in accordance with standard industry practice, to maximize the accuracy and security of such information and verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. We do not share specific personal customer information with independent companies for any other purpose without the customer's consent, except when required by law, regulation, or court order, and to third party litigants when required by lawful judicial process or court order.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE

We collect, use and share information about you so that we can provide the highest level of service to you for the products you use. We require companies to which we disclose non-public information about you to maintain its confidentiality.  
We may share information we collect to our affiliates (i.e., companies related to us by common control or ownership) that offer financial services or additional products and services. In addition, we may disclose information we collect to companies, both affiliates and non-affiliates that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other companies with which we have joint marketing arrangements. We are also permitted under law to disclose non-public personal information about you to affiliates and "non-affiliated third parties" in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose non-public personal information about you to companies that assist us in servicing your account.  
In certain circumstances, in order to comply with government requirements or court orders, we are required to disclose information about you or your transactions. We will do this only when required by law, regulation or court order. We share only the information required.

## HOW TO LIMIT SOLICITATIONS

From time to time, we or our affiliates or partners may call or write to tell you about products or services that we think may be of interest to you. You may tell us not to market products or services to you through telemarketing or direct mail marketing and not to provide your information to our affiliates or partners for marketing purposes by submitting a "no solicitation" request. You may, however, continue to receive promotional information in account related notices or other business purpose communications, including electronic announcements.

If you choose not to receive direct mail or telephone solicitations, please write to Customer Service at 7 Corporate Park Drive, Suite 130, Irvine, CA 92606 and request that we do not solicit you through, or provide information about you to financial partners for telemarketing or direct mail marketing.
