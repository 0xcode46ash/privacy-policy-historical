# GlobalSpec - Privacy Policy

GlobalSpec has one primary goal: to help the engineering and technical community quickly find products and services meeting their specifications. We're proud to offer this free service which is the largest of its kind. We understand the reluctance Web users have about providing user information, so we have instituted the following PRIVACY POLICY to address this issue:
