Transware may decide to change this policy from time to time. When we do, we will make the amended policy available on our website.

Transware may collect any or all of the following four types of information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) pixel tags or (d) contact information and other personal information. Transware's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties. Please note that Transware may transfer any information in its possession to any third party in connection with a sale of all or a substantial part of the assets of the company, a sale of the company or a merger.

**(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data.** Anonymous/statistical data about traffic and usage which does not include personal information and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Transware may freely share information it collects with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. Transware collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files users access. For example, Transware's servers may collect anonymous information about the site from which you entered to counter fraud and to identify areas and issues of common interest to visitors to our website in order to improve the experience we offer. In addition to the foregoing applications, Transware uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.

**(b) Cookies.** Like many organisations, Transware collects information about online behaviour using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning, as well as to evaluate and improve their experience of our Services and to help diagnose problems with our servers. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and the Services are useful and relevant.

Transware may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from so that we can provide the most relevant and useful information to users of our website.. To Transware, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to evaluate and improve our Services.

Finally, we may offer you the ability to have easier access to password-protected areas of our website by giving you the opportunity to access such areas automatically using a cookie which we would set on your computer.
