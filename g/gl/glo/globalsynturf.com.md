#### [Global Syn-Turf at Watersavers Irrigation's Demo Day](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/watersavers-demoday/1060/)

Global Syn-Turf, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of artificial grass, participated in Watersavers Irrigation's Demo Day on April 3rd. The event took place at one of Watersavers Irrigation's warehouse stores. More than 100 Northern California irrigation and green industry professionals and consumers attended the event to test out the latest irrigation systems and landscaping supplies, and listen to presentations from top supply manufacturers. "We've been selling artificial grass products for years now, so even before the event we had established ourselves in the region," said Rachel Brady, Global Syn-Turf's sales and marketing manager. "However, ever since California's water crisis, and now Jerry Brown's announcement of mandatory water restrictions, we've become the definitive regional experts on artificial grass in California. We're receiving an unprecedented amount of interest from local contractors and municipalities who want to test our products." With more than 95 gallons of water per day wasted on outdoor uses per household, consumers, contractors and dealers stand to benefit from artificial grass's advantages. According to ms. Brady, Global Syn-Turf has the power to fundamentally transform the culture of the irrigation and green industries by making it easy for people to have a perfectly lush, verdant lawn without consuming precious resources. The Global Syn-Turf team was on hand at the event to present the company's latest artificial grass innovations,

#### [The Prehistory of Artificial Grass](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/the-prehistory-of-artificial-grass/949/)

  When one thinks of artificial grass, the image that comes to mind is that of a lush, verdant yard with plastic fibers or an artificial grass soccer field at their local park. But that hasn't always been the case. In fact, according to a simple Google Search, the phrase "artificial grass" goes all the way back to the 18thcentury, when it had a different meaning. Back then, according to a monthly journal first published in 1861 called Evans's Rural Economist, artificial grass was any grass which required an art to grow (or any grass which required a "green thumb"). According to the journal, "Botanists restrict the term 'grass' to the natural order Graminea; but common observers, and even agricultural writers, in this country, apply the term 'artificial grass' to clovers and lucern, as well also as to timothy, and such grasses proper as require cultivation, restricting the term 'natural grass' to such grasses proper as naturally take possession without artificial seeding." This definition is very different than the meaning of today. Today, on the contrary, artificial grass refers to a synthetic grass surface which doesn't require a green thumb, art, or cultivation at all -- because synthetic grass doesn't grow! It is unclear when the change in meaning occurred, but most likely it started with the introduction artificial

#### [From California Brown to Green - Drought Landscaping Ideas](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/from-california-brown-to-green-drought-landscaping-ideas/1176/)

California doesn't look green anymore. In the historic state of drought, Californian lawns are now on the edge of extinction. Homeowners and communities are continuously looking for alternatives and the artificial grass looks more and more attractive. Drought landscaping options are limited. Some Californias tore down their lawns and replaced it with native plants. Others simply ignored the fact and let their grass turn brown and die. The more progressive ones turned to the artificial grass and kept their yards looking as green as the water drought never happen. For most, the transition wasn't expensive. The rebates offered by California's water agencies covered more than a half of expense the soil and grass removal and new turf installation would cost otherwise. Artificial grass is hassle-free and doesn't require water to keep beautiful, always green appearance. It doesn't need trimming, edging, and fertilizing. Potentially, artificial grass will help to cut off about 70 percent of California's water usage. Artificial grass provides something native plants and cement can't, - safe playgrounds and comfortable outdoor entertainment spaces. Artificial grass has been a growing trend in California; people understand it is a viable alternative to water-thirsty lawns, increasing water bills, and sky-rocketing penalties. Less
