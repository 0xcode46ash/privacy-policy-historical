#### [Global Syn-Turf at Watersavers Irrigation's Demo Day](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/watersavers-demoday/1060/)

Global Syn-Turf, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of artificial grass, participated in Watersavers Irrigation's Demo Day on April 3rd. The event took place at one of Watersavers Irrigation's warehouse stores. More than 100 Northern California irrigation and green industry professionals and consumers attended the event to test out the latest irrigation systems and landscaping supplies, and listen to presentations from top supply manufacturers. "We've been selling artificial grass products for years now, so even before the event we had established ourselves in the region," said Rachel Brady, Global Syn-Turf's sales and marketing manager. "However, ever since California's water crisis, and now Jerry Brown's announcement of mandatory water restrictions, we've become the definitive regional experts on artificial grass in California. We're receiving an unprecedented amount of interest from local contractors and municipalities who want to test our products." With more than 95 gallons of water per day wasted on outdoor uses per household, consumers, contractors and dealers stand to benefit from artificial grass's advantages. According to ms. Brady, Global Syn-Turf has the power to fundamentally transform the culture of the irrigation and green industries by making it easy for people to have a perfectly lush, verdant lawn without consuming precious resources. The Global Syn-Turf team was on hand at the event to present the company's latest artificial grass innovations,

We were excited to be a part of it this year," says Bruce Lamb, Territory Sales Manager, East Coast.

#### [The Prehistory of Artificial Grass](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/the-prehistory-of-artificial-grass/949/)

  When one thinks of artificial grass, the image that comes to mind is that of a lush, verdant yard with plastic fibers or an artificial grass soccer field at their local park. But that hasn't always been the case. In fact, according to a simple Google Search, the phrase "artificial grass" goes all the way back to the 18thcentury, when it had a different meaning. Back then, according to a monthly journal first published in 1861 called Evans's Rural Economist, artificial grass was any grass which required an art to grow (or any grass which required a "green thumb"). According to the journal, "Botanists restrict the term 'grass' to the natural order Graminea; but common observers, and even agricultural writers, in this country, apply the term 'artificial grass' to clovers and lucern, as well also as to timothy, and such grasses proper as require cultivation, restricting the term 'natural grass' to such grasses proper as naturally take possession without artificial seeding." This definition is very different than the meaning of today. Today, on the contrary, artificial grass refers to a synthetic grass surface which doesn't require a green thumb, art, or cultivation at all -- because synthetic grass doesn't grow! It is unclear when the change in meaning occurred, but most likely it started with the introduction artificial

#### [Global Syn-Turf: Giving Back to the Fort Worth Community](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/global-syn-turf-giving-back-to-fort-worth-community/1213/)

We are thrilled to be a part of a future of Fort Worth, Texas! The park on Magnolia and Henderson is one of its kind parks in the United States, created by efforts of local enthusiasts and thousands of people in the community. Two weeks ago, it was just a vacant lot left alone for future development. Today, it's a beautiful small oasis for individuals and families to take a break and get together to talk, play and enjoy outdoors. Fort Worth, Texas has more than 270 city parks, and according to Open Space Master Plan signed in 2015 by the City of Fort Worth Parks and Community Services Department envisions to restore and maintain the viability of the park, recreation, and open space systems, provide new parkland to meet recreational needs in developing areas of the city, and improve the variety of park and open space opportunities available to the community. But there are small empty places throughout the city that can be transformed into restful islands, the monument of community efforts, just like the Magnolia Park. This park is created 100 percent by donated materials and build by local companies and community members. Colorful blue containers are neatly

#### [Can Drought Steal The American Dream?](http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/can-drought-steal-the-american-dream/1209/)

The state of Califonia is currently in its fifth year of severe drought. Despite Governor Brown's declaration of a state drought emergency in 2014, Californias fell short of the mandated water conservation target. Residents used 23.9 percent less water in 2014 compared to 2013. Official call is an "enormous effort" is saving water despite missed target. Saved water in the nine months period is enough for nearly six million people for one year. Even though El Nino delivered a near-average amount of precipitations and snow in some areas of the state, Southern California saw relatively weak year of rain, leaving most reservoirs low. Any changes to the emergency conservation order will take effect in June 2016. During times of drought, plants and vegetation dry, stream and river flow decline, the water level in reservoirs, lakes and wells fall. As drought persists, long-term impact will emerge, land subsidence, seawater intrusion, and damage to the ecosystem. It can cause the land to sink due to excessive groundwater pumping and aquifer depletion. Seawater intrusion in coastal communities compromises groundwater quality. Water allocations for river, wildlife, wetland and fish restoration projects can be stopped or reduced. A single spark can start wildfires in
