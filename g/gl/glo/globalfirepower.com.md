# GFP Site Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us! As such, GlobalFirepower.com does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to our website (www.globalfirepower.com, globalfirepower.com, GFP). As with many websites on the internet today, GFP collects standard traffic and user habit information for the purposes of gaining a better understanding of user behavior and traffic patterns related to our content. In this way, we can use such data to provide a better user experience on our website in the future. The statistical tracking allows us to see what technologies our users are viewing the site with (ex: operating system, browser) and allows us to make changes to our site to accommodate this technology.

For your information, the following is the only information we collect during a typical user visit to our website:

• Browser Type and Resolution  
• Operating System  
• IP Address  
• Entry Page, Pages Visited in Order of Visit and Exit Page  
• Inbound Links from whence you came to our website (if coming from another website's link)

For full disclosure, you can see our [publicly available tracker here](http://extremetracking.com/open;unique?login=gfp101). (the tracker is also publicly available in icon form in the footer of all of our pages).

So rest assured that no personal information of yours is being collected, tracked and reviewed. We collect information that is completely anonymous and is information that is tracked by most any other website you visit on any given day.

To summarize, GFP is only interested in an anonymous user with an IP address of "34.546.77.45" coming to our site and spending only 5 seconds before deciding to leave. With this data in hand, we can research what page(s) that anonymous user visited, how the user came to the site (search engine, direct type-in, external link from another website) and why that user might have left so quickly. We can then begin addressing the issue by attempting to provide more relevant content on our website pages for any future visits by that visitor.

You may also notice that we use third party advertisements across GlobalFirepower.com in an effort to financially support the design fees and hosting costs associated with maintaining websites on internet. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as "cookies" when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP (Internet Service Provider), the browser you used to visit our site, and (in some cases) whether you have add-ons installed such as the widely-used Flash Player. This information is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads to a user based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites) based on their current browser history (deleting your "temporary internet files" will clear your history).

In the case of Google Adsense ads, this ad server uses the DoubleClick DART cookie. As per the Google website, is is explained as such:

• Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this website.  
• Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

You can chose to disable, or selectively turn off, cookies or third-party cookies through your browser settings or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this may affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites you may visit. For instance, this might effect your ability to access, or login, to certain services or programs such as forums or user accounts so tread carefully.

With all that said, we sincerely, hope you have a pleasant experience on www.globalfirepower.com and look forward to repeat visits. We may be contacted through MilitaryFactory at Gmail dot com to which your email will be forwarded to the appropriate department.
