## Electronic Downloads

Electronic items sold are final. All products have a number of sample pages available on the product page, and a sample version of the audio to try before purchase. Please sign up for the 30-day free trial or contact customer service for help.

Electronic items may be downloaded more than once (use the same link in your order confirmation email), but as large downloads are expensive, please note that we may restrict access if you download the files too many times. Keep your files in a safe place.

## Physical Books

You may return books within 30 days in the original packaging and condition you received them for a refund.

For books sold as part of a package, the refundable amount is the original purchase price minus the retail price of the audio and/or ebook components.

Example: if the Book Package was purchased for US$87.99, and the Audio Package retail price is US$39.99, the refundable amount is 87.99 - 39.99 = US$48, minus the original shipping cost that we paid to ship the items to you, which varies by destination.

You are responsible for the cost of return shipping to Taiwan.
