Like many other websites CARE International UK uses **cookies** and anonymous identifiers in order to provide you with a better, more personal web experience. A cookie is a file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer and which enables the website to recognise you. Cookies cannot in themselves be used to identify you. An anonymous identifier is a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available.

If you do not wish to receive cookies you can easily modify your web browser to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, should you choose to refuse cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the website such as interactive features.

We use **Google Analytics** to track non-identifying, anonymous website usage statistics, such as pages visited and referring websites, for the purposes of improving our websites; **Google Advertiser Features** to collect non-identifying, anonymous information for interest-based online advertising; and **Google Demographic and Interest Reports** to collect non-identifying, anonymous demographic data (such as age, gender and interest group) for reporting on general website visitor trends. We also use  **KISSmetrics** to collect non-identifying, anonymised data for the purpose of measuring website repeat visitors and website effectiveness.

For more information on Google Analytics please see [www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/index.html](http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/index.html). For more information on KISSmetrics please see [www.kissmetrics.com](http://www.kissmetrics.com/) 

We will never pass any information to Google:

  * that Google could use or recognise as personally-identifiable information; or
  * that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a mobile phone's unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any data transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

### 5\. What are your rights?

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
