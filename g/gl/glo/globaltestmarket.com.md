What personally identifiable information does GlobalTestMarket collect from me?  
GlobalTestMarket collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, GlobalTestMarket asks for your name, email address, zip code, household information and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to GlobalTestMarket - use to access the various protected areas of the site.

Also, if you contact GlobalTestMarket we may keep a record of that correspondence. Whenever GlobalTestMarket collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.
