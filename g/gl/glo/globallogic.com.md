# GlobalLogic - The Leader in Global Offshore Software Product Development

GlobalLogic, Inc. is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. Although generally a User is under no obligation to provide personal information while accessing the GlobalLogic Site, there are some circumstances under which a User may be asked to provide such information. 

**Information Collection and Use**

In some circumstances, GlobalLogic may request personal information from the User, such as his or her name, e-mail address, company name, telephone number, etc. Users are free to respond or not to respond to these inquiries; all information provided to GlobalLogic is strictly voluntary. GlobalLogic is the sole owner of information collected by this Site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to third parties.

This Site allows Users to submit their resumes online. Any resume received by GlobalLogic will be held in confidence and used only for the purpose of considering the submitting party for employment. Such information is not shared with any third parties or external agencies.

Some areas of this Site may require Users to provide personal information in order to complete certain functions. Such functions may not be available to Users who choose not to provide the information requested.

**Registration for Collateral and Software Downloads**

In order to download collateral or trial versions of software provided on the GlobalLogic Site, a User must first fill out a registration form that requests the User's contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the User about the products and services for which he or she has expressed interest. 

**Collecting Information for Surveys**

At times GlobalLogic conducts online surveys to better understand the needs and profiles of our Site Users. We will try to the best of our abilities to inform Users of how we will use this information at the time of conducting the survey. Survey participation is completely voluntary, and Users may refrain from contributing to the survey at any point in time.

**Use of Log Files**

GlobalLogic collects User domain information in order to analyze the use of this Site. This data enables us to become more familiar with who visits our Site, how often they visit and what parts of the Site they visit most often. GlobalLogic uses this information to improve its Web-based offerings. This information is collected automatically and requires no action by the User. By accessing our Site, Users grant their unconditional consent to allow GlobalLogic to collect their domain names.

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the User's hard drive that contains information about the User. By using a cookie on the GlobalLogic Site, a User does not have to log into the Site using a password more than once. Cookies also enable GlobalLogic to track and target the interests of our Users in order to enhance their experience on our Site. Using a cookie while on the GlobalLogic Site does not provide us with the User's personal information. Once the User closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a User rejects the cookie, he or she may still access the GlobalLogic Site. However, the User may experience usage limitations in some areas of the Site.

**Links**

The GlobalLogic Site contains links to other websites. Please be aware that GlobalLogic is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each website they visit when leaving the GlobalLogic Site.

**Security  
**  
GlobalLogic takes every precaution to protect a User's information. When Users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline. 

When a GlobalLogic registration/order form asks Users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted using the best encryption software in the industry-SSL. While on a secure GlobalLogic page, the "lock" icon at the bottom of the User's web browser will become locked, as opposed to the unlocked icon that appears when Users are viewing unsecured pages. 

In addition to using SSL encryption to protect sensitive User information online, GlobalLogic also takes extensive measures to protect User information offline. All User information (including non-sensitive data) is restricted to the GlobalLogic offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific task (e.g., billing clerks, customer service representatives, etc.) are granted access to Users' personally identifiable information.

If you have any questions about the security of the GlobalLogic Site, please contact us at [info@globallogic.com](mailto:info@globallogic.com)

**Site and Service Updates**

GlobalLogic reserves the right to distribute Site and service announcements to Users. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the User's requested services. GlobalLogic communicates with Users via email or phone to provide requested services and to resolve issues relating to their accounts.

GlobalLogic reserves the right to modify or update the privacy statement at any time without notice.
