**Links**

GlobalLogic web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that GlobalLogic is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

**Security  
**  
GlobalLogic website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry—SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@globallogic.com](mailto:info@globallogic.com)

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their account via email or phone.  
GlobalLogic reserves the right to modify or update the privacy statement at any time without notice.
