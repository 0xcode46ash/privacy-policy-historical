##    
Information We Collect

**Non-Personal** **Information.** Like most websites, we may collect certain technical information about your use of the Website when you visit us, and generally this is not information that could be used to identify you without reference to other information (collectively, “Usage Information”). 

For example, we may collect your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, the identity of your internet service provider (ISP), the number and duration of page visits, how you were directed to the Website, what country your visit originates from, and the number of clicks you make when you use the Website. This does not include demographic information about you. 

We may also use cookies in conjunction with our analysis of Usage Information.  A cookie is a file that web servers place on an internet user’s computer.  Cookies are designed to store basic information about the user and transmit that information back to servers that recognize them.  They may be used to measure visitor behavior on and in connection with a website, including through the transmission of Usage Information.  We use both persistent and session cookies to analyze our users’ common practices.  Our persistent cookies remain on your machine after you exit your browser session with us and will become active again when you return to the Website.  Depending on which browser you use to access the internet (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.), you can change your settings to effect whether to accept, store, or delete cookies.

**Your Submissions of Personal Information.** You have the opportunity to submit personal information to us through various means, including but not limited to the Website by clicking the “[Contact Sales](http://www.globalenglish.com/howtobuy/contact_enterprise_sales)” link from our homepage, in which case you would input your name, job title, email address, information about your company and a message to be submitted to our team for review and response.

We track and reference your Usage Information by region, in aggregation with the Usage Information of other visitors to the Website, to better understand how effective our Website is and how visitors interact with it.  Only GlobalEnglish has direct access to such analysis, which may be generated using third party software tools.

  * to analyze trends, track user movement, and gather statistical information for aggregate use.



We store your Personal and Usage Information on cloud servers hosted in the United States by third parties.  Our cloud service providers are subject to contractual restrictions which limit their use of our content to providing our cloud services and do not, as a matter of course, send your information to any third parties.

##    
Sharing of Your Information

We will not share your Personal Information with third parties other than as provided in this Privacy Policy.  We may share your Personal Information with third parties in one or more of the following ways:

We may share your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with any parent or subsidiaries, or other companies or entities which control, are controlled by or under common control with GlobalEnglish, in which case we will require such parties to honor this Privacy Policy with respect to such shared information.

  
**Third Party Service Providers**

We may provide your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, cloud servers, customer service and data analysis.  We may use independent contractors to provide services on our behalf and they may access your Personal Information in the course of providing those services.  We require such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide services to GlobalEnglish.

  
**Safety, Security and Compliance with Law**

We may disclose any information, including Personal Information, we deem necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, to enforce our rights or to protect the safety and security of our Website or other users.

In the event GlobalEnglish undergoes a business transition, such as a major investment transaction, merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer your Personal Information to the actual or intended successor organization in such transaction or permit its examination by our counterparty, subject to confidentiality restrictions.  If material changes to GlobalEnglish’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, GlobalEnglish will attempt to notify you via email and will post a notice on the Website alerting you to the business transition prior to transferring your Personal Information.

  
**Other Third Parties**

As of March 1, 2012, GlobalEnglish does not engage in any direct marketing or targeted third party advertisements, either via email or through the use of cookies or other technical means on the Website and therefore does not use your username or email address for such purposes.

At any time, you may contact GlobalEnglish to request that we make changes to your Personal Information or delete your account entirely.  If you request that we update or otherwise modify your information, we will amend your Personal Information within a reasonable time after your request.  To inquire about which items of Personal Information GlobalEnglish possesses about you or to request its modification, please email us at [customersupport@globalenglish.com](mailto:customersupport@globalenglish.com).

##    
How We Secure Your Information

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to secure authentication of your access to all Services, as discussed in our [Product Privacy Policy](https://corp.globalenglish.com/templates/bin/template.asp?classId=204&objectId=232661&prop=type=1).  Any data transmitted between production systems is done via secure VPN/SSL/FTP channels.

GlobalEnglish uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect user’s Personal and Non-Personal Information, online and offline.  Because of the nature of our website, our employees, contractors, and third party service providers are generally subject to restrictions which limit their use of information obtained from GlobalEnglish to the business purpose of the relationship for which we contract.  GlobalEnglish also takes reasonable steps to protect information we collect from you to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ENCRYPT ANY TRANSMISSIONS TO OR FROM THE WEBSITE IN ANY MANNER.  IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE UNENCRYPTED TRANSMISSION OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DESCRIBED HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT INFORMATION TO US THROUGH THE WEBSITE.

While we take reasonable precautions to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you against possible security breaches of the Services, no website, Internet transmission or security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.  In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected documents you store, or discussions which occur, on our systems are maintained at adequate levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

##    
Our Policies Concerning Children

This Website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from such children.  Children under the age of 13 should not use our Website or our online services at any time.  In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to erase such information from our records.

##    
Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users of the Website by sending a notice to the email address that you have provided in connection with your Website account and/or Website by placing a notice on our Website, and you should periodically check the Website for such notices.  Regardless of any changes we make to our Privacy Policy, we will only use your Personal Information in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy in place at the time you provided your information (including without limitation the opt-out provided herein), unless you later give your express consent for us to do otherwise.

Please see our [GlobalEnglish Services Privacy Policy](https://corp.globalenglish.com/templates/bin/template.asp?classId=204&objectId=232661&prop=type=1) for information about how our product-specific privacy policies are amended and the use, storage and security of information you submit through our products.
