# Global Citizen

##  Introduction

Global Citizen (the “Platform”) is a platform run by the Global Poverty Project ("GPP", “we” or “us"). We take privacy and data protection issues seriously. We have established this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to explain how we handle personally identifiable information collected from user of the Platform.

By accessing and using the Platform, you agree that you have read and understand this Policy and you accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information) that are described in this Policy.

This policy sets out GPP's personal information management practices. It covers the following areas:

  * application of policy;
  * personal information collected;
  * use and disclosure of personal information;
  * use of the Platform;
  * accessing and updating personal information;
  * security of personal information;
  * data tracking;
  * external links;
  * changes to this privacy policy; and
  * contact details.



##  Application of Policy

This policy applies to all our personnel, including volunteers and other individuals with whom we do business.

##  Responsibilities of Personnel

It is the responsibility of all personnel to:

  * be familiar with this policy; and
  * comply with this policy.



##  Personal Information Collected

GPP only collects personal information that is necessary for the Platform’s functions and activities. This information will only be collected with the consent of the individual or otherwise in accordance with the law.

As with many other websites, the web servers used to operate the Platform may collect certain non-personal data pertaining to users of the Platform and the equipment and communications method that they use to access the Internet and the Platform. Without combining these data with other sources of information, they do not readily or personally identify individuals. They may reveal such things as the Internet protocol (“IP”) address assigned to an individual’s computer, specific pages that an individual accessed on the Platform or immediately prior to visiting the Platform, and the length of time spent in a visit to the Platform. The purposes for which this information is collected and used include facilitating Platform operation and system administration, the generating of aggregate, non-identifiable statistical information, monitoring and analysing Platform traffic and usage patterns, and improving the content and content delivery with regard to the Platform and the content, materials, opportunities, and services that we describe or make available on the Platform.

You will receive regular updates from the Global Poverty Project on actions to take. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email.

We may also use “cookies” (small text files stored on users’ computers) to help track and customize access and use of the Platform. Cookies store and retain information that helps us recognize individuals when they return to the Platform following a previous visit. Most popular Internet browser packages allow one to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Platform and the materials, products, and services that we make available on the Platform.

##  Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

We will generally use and disclose personal information for purposes related to the main purpose for which the information was collected, or where the individual has consented to the use or disclosure.

In addition, we may disclose personal information to third party service providers who assist us in providing our services. These may include companies which assist with data processing and analysis, research, mail services or maintenance. Personal information will only be disclosed to those third party service providers on a confidential basis so that the service provider can effectively provide those services.

Specifically, LBL uses PayPal (Europe) S.?.r.l. & CIE, S.C.A ("PayPal") to process payments.

PayPal uses the payment-related information that it receives as necessary and appropriate to fulfil requests to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and to otherwise deliver payment services. Personally identifiable information about consumers is used by PayPal to process payment transactions and for no other purpose. PayPal's full privacy policy can be viewed [here.](https://cms.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_GB)

In addition, with your explicit permission, we pass along certain of your information to the following groups:

  * World leaders, news publications and other targets when you choose to use our email tool to send them messages.
  * World leaders, news publications, and the general public when you sign petitions or complete surveys.



Under circumstances where we determine that members may be misusing our systems for malicious purposes (for example, using the numbers we provide to make harassing phone calls), such activities may be reported to law enforcement agencies. In such cases, we may release personally identifiable information, including name and address, to those agencies.

##  Disclosure to Facilitate Tax Effective Giving

Where appropriate and indicated by the donor, GPP will pass on the certain information about a donor to the recipient charity to enable the donation to be made in a fully tax effective way.

The use of this information will be restricted to this specific purpose unless indicated otherwise by the donor.

##  Disclosure When Required by Law

We may otherwise use or disclose personal information where required or authorised by law, which may include emergency situations and assisting law enforcement agencies.

##  Disclosure to Partner NGOs

From time to time we will feature actions including, but not limited to petitions and email campaigns, supplied by partner organisations on the Platform. These actions may be subject to data sharing agreements between us and these partner organisations. Where such agreements are in place, this will be clearly noted on the content pages associated with the action. By taking these actions, you are agreeing to further contact from the partner organisation(s) associated with that action.

You acknowledge that GPP has no control over the content, frequency and/or any other aspect of such communications.

##  Access to Database/Mailing Lists

We will not allow access to our database or mailing lists to any organisation or individual, except as expressly permitted by the user. However, if the material another organisation or individual wishes to circulate through our database is sympathetic with our core values and is within the use anticipated by those on the mailing list, we will take responsibility for the circulation and will ask that the organisation/individual to provide us with a letter explaining their request.

##  Credit Card Security

GPP uses PayPal to process and accept donations for the campaign. Live Below the Line does not store any credit card information.

PayPal adheres to international PCI (payment card industry) compliance standards for data security.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of 12 requirements that all businesses who handle credit or debit card payments must comply with. The PCI Security Standards require all merchants, regardless of size or number of transactions, who accept, store, transmit or process any cardholder data to comply with PCI DSS. You can find out more about PCI [here.](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)

PayPal's PCI Compliance can be validated [here.](http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp.html?ep=v_sym_cisp)

##  Petitions and Surveys

For petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information—for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to world leaders and other targets, or to the press. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the designated target as part of a petition. This is a standard industry practice in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number, without your permission. We may also make your comments, along with your first name, city and state available to the press and public online. We are not responsible for the content of use of your email address by campaign targets.

##  Sending Emails via the Platform

In certain cases, we enable you to send individual e-mails to world leaders as well as Letters-to-the-Editor to various news publications, through our website. These messages are sent in your name, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and contact information is provided as part of the submission. These messages will only be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis using our email tool. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our email tool. We take no responsibility for the content of use of your email address by campaign targets.

##  Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information

We take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information collected, used and disclosed is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Individuals who need to access or correct any personal information held by us about them are asked to send a request to [globalcitizen@globalpovertyproject.com](mailto:globalcitizen@globalpovertyproject.com). As much detail as possible should be provided by the individual about the particular information sought, in order to enable us to retrieve it. An access fee may be charged to cover the costs of providing that information.

In certain circumstances, we may not be required by law to provide the individual with access to, or to correct, personal information. If this is the case, reasons will be given for that decision.

##  Security of Personal Information

We take reasonable steps to protect all of the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard copy form.

##  Information Security

We use firewalls and other industry standard security technology, as well as industry standard security practices, to protect personal and confidential information that we receive and to prevent that information from being accessed by unauthorized persons. For example, we work to protect the security of information submitted through the Platform during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information. The information that you submit through the Platform is gathered on computers, and stored in a data center, protected by industry standard security practices. The number of employees that have physical access to our data center, and to the computer on which personal information is stored, is limited.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

##  Data Tracking

In order to better serve our members, we use cookies and periodically analyze web logs. We may collect IP addresses to better understand where our traffic is coming from, and to provide customized services to members. We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our website. We may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings, so that we can tell which mailings appeal most to Global Citizen users.

URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page. We use these URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL which contains an id—we do this to simplify the display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs which do not handle long URLs. When a shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser's address bar when you access the page.

##  Links to Other Websites

We may provide links to third party websites, and other websites may provide links to the Platform. Third party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. We have no control over such third party websites, and by using this Platform, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of such third party sites, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that we will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.

##  Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may revise or amend this policy at any time at our sole discretion. If we make any substantive changes in the way we collect or use personally identifying information provided by users, we will post a prominent announcement on the Platform’s home page and post the changes on this page. We will never change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information collected prior to the effective date of any changes without the consent of affected users. We encourage users to visit this page periodically to review our current policy.
