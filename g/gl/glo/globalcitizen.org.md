# Privacy Policy | The Hunger Project

The Hunger Project is firmly committed to the privacy of our investors and to the integrity of our records. Outlined here are the policies we use to protect your privacy and safeguard any information you entrust to us.

If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please email us at [webmaster@thp.org](mailto:webmaster@thp.org).

 **1\. Online giving:** Our website is linked to Verisign to provide investors with a safe, secure and private facility for making online credit-card gifts.

 **2\. Investor Records:** The Hunger Project does not sell, disclose or share information with other organizations and we do not permit our records to be used for any activity other than official Hunger Project business. We provide information about major contributions to tax authorities as required by law. The Hunger Project only grants access to investor records to Hunger Project authorized persons who have signed agreements respecting the confidentiality of these records.

 **3\. Email list:** We will send you a short email update approximately once a month to update you on additions to our website and other Hunger Project news. If you ever decide you do not want these updates, you can change your preference, unsubscribe, or email a request to be removed to [webmaster@thp.org](mailto:webmaster@thp.org).

 **4\. Virus protection:** The Hunger Project protects its computers with firewalls and leading anti-virus protection software. We update our email system anti-virus protection software daily.

 **5\. Mailings:** The Hunger Project does not send mailings to people who just visit our website. We do not do mass mailings or phone-a-thons. We send very limited communications by mail to our contributors. If you would prefer not to receive any mail, you may request this by emailing [webmaster@thp.org](mailto:webmaster@thp.org), and we will mark your record accordingly.

 **6\. Web logging:** Web server software routinely logs sessions. The Hunger Project does not keep or use any information that links your web usage to your identity except in those cases where you specifically want us to have the information, e.g. when sending us order or subscription information, or when participating in surveys and study groups.

 **7\. Cookies:** Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the The Hunger Project website or third-party service providers through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. The Hunger Project uses "cookie" technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online experience and facilitate their visit within our site.

 **8\. Policy changes:** If we ever change any of these policies, we will post those changes on this site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
