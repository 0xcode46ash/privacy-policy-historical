Privacy Policy

GlobalShopex is committed to protecting your information, how it's used and how it's shared, and we appreciate you choosing to do business with us. This page describes our privacy policy. By visiting GlobalShopex, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**Personal Information About Customers Gathered By GlobalShopex**

**Information You Give Us**

We value your privacy. GlobalShopex willreceive and store the basic information you give us during checkout in order to process and deliver your products and provide you exceptional customer support.  You must provide contact information (such as name, email, telephone number and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). The information you provide us will be used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. 

We follow CAN SPAM laws and offer permission based email marketing.  If you do not wish for us to contact you about offers that may interest you, you may uncheck the opt in feature in the checkout, or opt out from the emails themselves by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail message you receive from GlobalShopex.

**Personal Data Security and Confidentiality**

We maintain adequate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Cookies**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide certain features and improve our business.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of GlobalShopex's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or to Sign in to GlobalShopex's website.

**Information Security**

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

**Third party content**

GlobalShopex may contain material, including advertising and links, which originates from third parties

**Terms Of Service, Notices, And Revisions**

If you choose to visit GlobalShopex, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Florida.

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. It is your responsibility to review this document periodically for changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
