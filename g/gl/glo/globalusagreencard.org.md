**How we Protect Information**

We take great care in employing generally accepted industry standards to protect the information we collect and retain. However, regardless of the measures and efforts we employ, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information.

Since we operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your information to countries outside the European Union. The data protection laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Union – in this instances we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your information. You hereby consent to transfer of your information to countries outside the European Union.

**How we Use Information**

We will use your information to provide you with the Services regarding assistance with filling out certain immigration forms related to the U.S. Diversity Visa Lottery or similar visa programs we may offer in the future. Our Services will also include submission of your application to the U.S. Diversity Visa Lottery or other visa programs, if applicable. You acknowledge, however, that certain Personal Information may become a matter of public record upon filing with a government agency or as part of any legal or administrative proceeding.

Except as specifically set forth in these Terms, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order, in order to protect our rights or in order to cooperate with an investigation by a law enforcement body.

We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make our Site and/or Services more useful, or to customize our Site and/or Services and personalize their content for you.

We use your credit card and billing information to process your payments.

We may use information you provided us to contact you from time to time to provide you with marketing offers and promotions, not necessarily related to the Services.

We may share your Personal Information with:

Members of our corporate family, or third party vendors or service providers, such as email service providers sending emails on our behalf. We may also authorize third party vendors or service providers to collect information on our behalf. We will require members of our corporate family and third party vendors to follow practices that protect your privacy rights on a level at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy

Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our website.

Referring websites: If you were referred to our Site from another website (for example, through a link), we  
may share some information about you with that  
referring website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here. Additionally, when you link to one of our  
partners from our Site, we provide that partner with a unique identifier so they know that you were referred from our Site. This unique identifier will not  
contain any of your Personal Information.

By analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning users, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users (“ **Statistical Information** “).

Site and/or Services.

We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services.
