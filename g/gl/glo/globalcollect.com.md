# GLOBAL ONLINE.COM - "The Global Online Community"

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**   
At Global Online, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. We want you to feel comfortable about the way your information is collected and used, and informed about your choices. 

**How We Use Information**   
When you provide us with information about yourself, when placing an order or signing up for a service, we use this information only to fulfill your order, service or product. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We produce summary reports for our advertisers, who make it possible for us to offer you our web site services free of charge. Reports do not identify individuals, but use aggregate data such as "Yesterday, 8,542 people clicked on "Advertisement X," and 20% of them previously indicated an interest in computer games." From this information our advertisers determine the effectiveness of their investment in our web site. We never identify who saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. 

You may choose to receive email from us; if so, we will always include instructions in each of these emails on how to unsubscribe from our mailing list. You may also email our customer service department to be removed from any mailing list. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We do not use these addresses for any other purpose, nor do we share them with outside parties. 

We never use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to those described above without providing you the opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Data Security**   
We utilize physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure information we collect online to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information. 

**Opting Out of Cookies**   
Global Online uses cookies to track ad exposure to prevent the user from being bombarded repeatedly with the same ad. Cookies are small text files commonly used by thousands of web sites to identify repeat visitors. Cookies are not programs, nor can they enter the user's system or damage files. Nor do they identify you personally. A cookie uses a numerical identification system that has no meaning outside of its own context. 

We use cookies to limit the repetitiveness of your advertising exposure. If you object to the use of cookies, please select the "no cookie" option in the preferences file of your Internet Explorer or Netscape browser. 

**How to Contact Us**   
Should you have any questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send an email to our [customer service department](http://207.177.51.22/customercare).
