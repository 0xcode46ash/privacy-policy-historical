**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

We collect personal information when you create an account or edit your account information, donate to a project, or send a gift card. We also collect some technical information about your use of our website. This information is used to facilitate your use of the site and your donations, to contact you when necessary, and to improve your experience. 

**Creating a globalgiving.com Account**

When you create an account on our website, we collect basic information about you - your name and email address. We collect additional personal information if you submit a profile or picture, or create a GlobalGiving gift registry. 

**Making a Donation**

When you make an online donation on globalgiving.com, we collect personal information such as your name, billing address, and email address, if you have not already provided these details. Credit card or bank account numbers are collected by a third-party payment vendor such as [VeriSign](https://web.archive.org/privacypol.html#1) or [PayPal](https://web.archive.org/privacypol.html#1) depending on the method of payment you choose. These partners' use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, which you should review. GlobalGiving will collect only your GlobalGiving account information and donation history. We do not collect or have access to the credit card numbers or bank account information our third-party vendors (PayPal and VeriSign) collect to process online transactions. 

**Gift Cards**

When you give a GlobalGiving gift card, we collect the name, email address, and mailing address of your recipient, as well as a personal message from you. This information is collected only to facilitate this service. 

**Contests, Promotions, and Surveys**

Periodically, GlobalGiving may invite you to participate in contests, take advantage of special promotions, and complete online surveys. The information we collect from these contests, promotions, and surveys may be associated with your individual account in order to help us improve our website and services. This information will only be shared as described in this policy, and your answers to surveys will only be used in aggregate. 

**Technical Information**

We collect some technical information about how you access and use our site. Cookies are small files that a website stores on your computer. We use cookies to collect information such as what type of browser you are using, the website from which you enter globalgiving.com, and the pages you view as you tour our site. We use this information to improve your experience (such as remembering your name or the items in your Giving Cart) and to help us compile aggregate statistics that allow us to make improvements in design and content to better serve you. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet. Like most websites, we identify your computer by its IP address. We use this to monitor information, such as the number of visitors that visit our website. 

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

We will share your personal information with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors in order to process your donations, offer you services in connection with our website, communicate news and information about GlobalGiving, provide customer service, enhance and improve customers' donor experiences, and complete financial transactions. These third parties are provided with your information only to the extent necessary to serve these purposes, or as otherwise authorized by this policy.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent, unless: (1) we need to respond to a subpoena, court order or legal process; (2) an emergency situation requires disclosure before your permission can be obtained (e.g., situations involving potential threats to personal safety), or; (3) to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of another person.

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our other partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Viewing and Updating Your Information on globalgiving.com**

You can access your account information at any time by going to the My Account page. You can make changes to your information and update your account at any time. 

You also can unsubscribe from a GlobalGiving newsletter at any time by sending an unsubscribe email as described at the bottom of every GlobalGiving newsletter, or by updating your newsletter subscriptions on the My Account page. 

**Links to Other Websites**

Other websites, including those of our partners (links to which appear on globalgiving.com), have their own privacy policies. When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the GlobalGiving privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

You should take additional steps to safeguard your personal information online. To learn more about how to protect yourself, visit the [Federal Trade Commission website](http://www.ftc.gov/). 

**Privacy Policy Updates**

Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers. If our information practices change materially, we will post the policy changes on the privacy page of this website to notify you of these changes. Please check our website periodically for more information on how we use the data we collect.

**Contact Us**

You may contact us by using the "Contact Us" links on the footer of our site. We try to reply promptly to every message we receive. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We also may file your comments and share them with our customer care team to improve our service in the future.
