# Privacy Statement

**GLOBAL1 respects your privacy.**

**PRIVACY ACT 1988**

  
From December 21st 2001 amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 came into force to deal with the way that companiesÂ  handle your personal information. GLOBAL1 is covered by the Privacy Act and the 10 National Privacy Principles in the Act.

In addition, GLOBAL1 has developed a Privacy Policy which ensures that all of our staff are aware of our privacy obligations, and respect the privacy of your personal information.

This statement tells you how, in general terms, we approach privacy and the handling of your personal information.

  
**How we use and disclose your personal information**

We collect your personal information through completed order and repair request forms in order to provide you with GLOBAL1 products and services, to administer and provide you with repair services and to market our products and services to you. This may include services such as car install, sales dockets, account sales, specific product category sales, warranties and home delivery.

  
If you make an application for finance in order to purchase one of our products, we will facilitate that request by forwarding your personal information as appropriate, with your consent. You will be provided with a document detailing how we handle your personal information, should you make a hire purchase through us.

  
We do not generally disclose your personal information to any other person or organization without your consent unless we are required or authorized by law to disclose certain information.

  
**You have a right of access to your personal information**

  
You have a right to access the personal information we collect and hold about you, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988. If at any time you would like to access this information, or your details change and you would like us to update our information, or you would like more information about how we handle your personal information, please contact our General Manager who acts in the capacity of Privacy Officer at Head Office, 29 South Street, Granville, NSW. A $10 administration fee will be charged for the retrieval of any personal information.
