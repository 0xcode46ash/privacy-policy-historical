We may make changes to this Policy from time to time in order to keep it up to date and compliant with legal requirements. Please refer to the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this page to see when this Policy was last revised. Note that we may also notify you about **significant** changes by email, using the address you last provided or by posting an alert which will be displayed when you access our systems. This Policy is not intended to override the terms of any contract that you have with us or between buyers and suppliers (or any rights you might have available under applicable data protection laws).
