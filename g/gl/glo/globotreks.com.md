# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At GloboTreks we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:[](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a  **Creative Commons Sharealike** license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link to our site somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)

**GloboTreks** is operated by Fuse Concepts Inc. It is GloboTreks’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, GloboTreks collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GloboTreks’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GloboTreks’ visitors use its website. From time to time, GloboTreks may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

GloboTreks also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. GloboTreks does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to GloboTreks’ websites choose to interact with GloboTreks in ways that require GloboTreks to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that GloboTreks gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a newsletter to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with GloboTreks are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, GloboTreks collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with GloboTreks. GloboTreks does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

GloboTreks may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. GloboTreks may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, GloboTreks does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

GloboTreks discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on GloboTreks’ behalf or to provide services available at GloboTreks’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using GloboTreks’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. GloboTreks will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, GloboTreks discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when GloboTreks believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of GloboTreks, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a GloboTreks website and have supplied your email address, GloboTreks may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with GloboTreks and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. GloboTreks takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. GloboTreks uses cookies to help GloboTreks identify and track visitors, their usage of GloboTreks website, and their website access preferences. GloboTreks visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using GloboTreks’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of GloboTreks’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GloboTreks and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, GloboTreks may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GloboTreks’ sole discretion. GloboTreks encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
