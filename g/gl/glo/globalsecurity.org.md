# GlobalSecurity.org Privacy Policy

The GlobalSecurity.org privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

Web servers serving GlobalSecurity.org automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., earthlink.net) of visitors. This information is used for various purposes including internal review and for traffic audits. We also provide this information about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers. 

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit: 

The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a universityâ€™s domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website. 

  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  * The date and time you access our site; 
  * The pages you visit; and 
  * If you linked to the GlobalSecurity.org website from another website, the address of that website. 



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors-to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.
