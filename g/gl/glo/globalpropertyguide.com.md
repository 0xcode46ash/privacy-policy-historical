# Privacy Policy - Global Property Guide

Last Updated: Oct 15, 2007

### Our Commitment To Privacy 

Your privacy is important to us at the Global Property Guide. To better protect your privacy, the Global Property Guide provides this notice explaining our online information practices. 

  


### The Information We Collect: 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Global Property Guide website. On some pages, you are asked to submit so that you can comment, order data, make requests, and register to receive a newsletter. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name   
Address   
Email address   
Phone number   
Credit/Debit Card Information   
(etc.) 

  


### The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. The Global Property Guide does not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other organizations. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, the Global Property Guide never uses or shares the personally identifiable information provided online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

  


### Have Your Say / Comments

If you make a comment on this site, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to submit your name. If you submit an e-mail, you will be given a clear choice as to whether you wish the e-mail to be made public or not, and if you choose to do so, we are not responsible if it is read, collected, or used by other readers. If you do not choose to make your e-mail address public, we will not use it for any other purpose except to communicate to you to answer you specific question, and will make every effort to ensure that it is not used in any other way, and that it is kept wholly confidential. 

  


### E-mail Newsletters

If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address, phone number) and information about the subscriber's professional interests and responsibilities. We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter. 

  


### Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
