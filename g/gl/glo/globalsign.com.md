# GlobalSign Privacy Policy

    GlobalSign Privacy Policy
GlobalSign Privacy Policy Version 2.05
    GlobalSign respects your right to privacy. This privacy policy has been developed to inform you
    about the privacy practices used by GlobalSign in connection with its websites, products and
    services. This privacy policy does not apply to GlobalSign services offered through our partners
    or resellers, and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of such partners or resellers.
    The privacy policy will inform you about what data is collected, how we use such data, if data is
    stored, how you opt out of your data being used, and the security provisions around storing your
    data and how to correct or update your data.
1.0 What information do we collect?
    We collect information from you when you place an order for a GlobalSign digital certificate, apply
    for access to the managed service platforms, subscribe to our newsletter, use our online chat
    service, download a white paper, register for a webinar, respond to a survey or fill out a form for
    pre/post sales assistance or open a support ticket.
    GlobalSign is a Certification Authority and trusted third party. To fulfill requests for digital
    certificates, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, physical address, phone
    number, credit card information and/or organizational details or other personally identifiable
    information.
    GlobalSign treats personally identifiable information as confidential, except the information
    entered into an issued digital certificate. Such information may be verified using third party
    commercial and government resources, and as such, is deemed to be public information.
2.0 What do we use your information for?
    Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
   2.1 To process applications for GlobalSign products and services
    Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to
    any other company for any reason without your consent, other than for the purpose of delivering
    the purchased product or service requested.
   2.2 To improve customer service
    Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your pre/post sales requests and
    technical support needs.
   2.3 To send renewal notices
    The email address you provide for order processing may be used to send you renewal notices
    within ninety (90) days prior to your digital certificate expiration.
   2.4 To send periodic emails
    In addition, we may send you periodic company newsletters, new service updates, security
    updates, related product or service information, and status updates on maintenance windows or
    service availability.

    GlobalSign Privacy Policy
3.0 Data retention
    To meet public CA audit requirements as detailed in the GlobalSign Certification Practice
    Statement, personal data used to fulfill verification of digital certificate applications will be
    retained for a minimum of 10 years depending on the class of product or service and may be
    retained in either a physical or electronic format. Please refer to the GlobalSign Certification
    Practice Statement for full details.
4.0 Updating your email preferences
    If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include unsubscribe
    instructions at the bottom of each email.
    Renewal notices may be cancelled on a per digital certificate basis by logging into your GlobalSign
    Certificate Center (GCC) account and disabling renewal notices.
5.0 How do we protect your information?
    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information
    when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. All supplied
    sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and then encrypted in
    our database to be accessed only by authorized individuals with certain access rights to our
    systems and who are required to keep the information confidential.
    After a transaction, your sensitive transaction-related information (credit cards, identification
    numbers, financials, etc.) will be kept on file to meet audit requirements and facilitate renewals.
    Credit card details are maintained only in encrypted format.
    GlobalSign uses a reputable third party to process credit card payments and needs to provide
    credit card numbers and identifying financial data directly to the third party credit card
    processor. Such information is shared securely.
   5.1 What happens to personal information if a GlobalSign account is terminated?
    If your GlobalSign account is terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally
    identifiable information is placed in “deactivated” status in our relevant databases. However,
    termination of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been
    deleted from our database. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as
    necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our
    agreements.
6.0 Use of cookies to fulfill services
    The GlobalSign Certificate Center (GCC) uses cookies to enable the fulfillment of services. Cookies
    may be used when you log into the GCC, purchase products or use certain GCC functions.
7.0 Use of cookies and web beacons to gather statistical information
    Like most online businesses, GlobalSign uses cookies and web beacons on our websites and
    through marketing related emails to gather and analyze non-personal information such as the
    visitor’s IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system, date/time and basic
    geographical information.
    GlobalSign Privacy Policy - Version 2.05                                                   2 of 4


    GlobalSign Privacy Policy
    We use cookies and web beacons to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction
    so that we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications and offer better site experiences
    and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better
    understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information
    collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
    First time visitors may choose to not have any activity monitoring cookies set in their browser.
    We use an opt-out identification cookie to tag these users as having made this decision. Those
    cookies that pertain to site performance, experience improvement and marketing are
    programmed not to execute when an opt-out cookie is present in a visitor’s browser. Opt-out
    cookies persist until a visitor clears their browser cookies, or until their expiration one year after
    the set date. A visitor is required to opt out again after one year in order to disable any activity
    monitoring cookies.
8.0 Use of server logs for diagnostics or to gather statistical information
    Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of our services.
    Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the
    referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search
    terms, and cookie information. We use this information to diagnose and improve our services. We
    will either delete the Log Data or remove any account identifiers, such as your username, full IP
    address, or email address, after 18 months.
9.0 Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
    information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website,
    fulfilling digital certificate applications or help us to optimize or add value to the services we offer,
    such as offering integrated third party products or services. In circumstances where data is
    shared with such third parties, they are required to agree to confidentiality terms. This prohibits
    such third parties from selling, trading, using, marketing or otherwise distributing GlobalSign
    customer data.
    We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the
    law or protect our rights, property, or safety.
    It is our policy to notify customers of requests for their data from law enforcement unless
    prohibited from doing so by statute or court order. Law enforcement officials who believe that
    notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other
    process that specifically precludes member notification, such as an order issued pursuant to 18
    U.S.C. §2705(b).
10.0 Registration
    GlobalSign has registered with the competent authorities as required by law regarding its
    collecting, processing and archiving of personal data. You may refer to the competent authority
    named below to obtain further information regarding this registration:
    Commission for the Protection of Personal Data
