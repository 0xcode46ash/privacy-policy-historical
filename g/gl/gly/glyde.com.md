# Glyde - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how we manage your personal information during your use of the glyde.com website. If you use or visit glyde.com, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy is effective on March 31, 2008. 

##  Collection of Data 

You can visit glyde.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you register, you are no longer unidentified to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers. 

Glyde Corporation (Glyde) will collect and store the following personal information: 

  * Billing and shipping address, email address, and financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers 

  * Transactional information based on your activities on the sites (buying and selling) 

  * Billing, shipping, and other information you provide to purchase or sell an item 




You also provide information when you search, buy, sell, fill out a questionnaire, communicate with customer service, contact us by phone, e-mail, physical mail, or participate in community features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone numbers; credit card information; and people (and their addresses) to whom purchases have been shipped. 

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include, but are not limited to, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, time-zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, platform; purchase history; products you viewed or searched for; and your sales history. We may also use browser data such as cookies, or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, navigation patterns, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. 

Glyde may also collect information from third parties. Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from other sites with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and search result information, search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers. 

## Marketing

Glyde will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may merge your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our content and services. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us, you have the option to "opt out" by clicking on the link at the bottom of an email. 

## Disclosure of Information

Glyde may disclose personal information to enforce our policies, respond to legal requirements, or protect anyone's property, rights, or safety. 

We may also share your personal information with: 

  * Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history. 

  * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, merchant services, and fulfillment services). 

  * Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (In the event such a combination occurs, we will require that the new combined entity adhere to this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy.) 




Without limiting the above, in an effort to maintain your privacy, we will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other agencies without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. 

## Personal and Financial Information

Your User Name is not displayed to other users during a transaction on glyde.com. The only time anyone will know your name and shipping address is when you are involved in a transaction, and a seller receives a pre-addressed Glyde Mailer to send you an item. The seller will have no access to any information other than your name and shipping address. Our User Agreement and this Privacy Policy prohibits sellers from contacting buyers beyond fulfillment of a given transaction. If you receive unwanted contact from a seller, please email us at [service@glyde.com](mailto:service@glyde.com). Users who are not directly involved in shipping an item to you cannot view your shipping address. 

## Cookies

Cookies are identifiers that we transfer to your computer through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and provide various usability features. A few important things you should know about cookies: 

  * We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. 

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies. 

  * Some cookies are "session cookies", which means that that they are automatically deleted from your computer at the end of a session. 

  * You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services. 




Most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of glyde.com's best features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, efficient, and personalized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to: 

  * Provide services and customer support

  * Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems

  * Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement

  * Customize, measure and improve our services and content

  * Tell you about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences

## Spam and Phishing Emails

You are not licensed to add Glyde users who have bought an item from you to your mailing list without their express consent. Glyde will not send you emails requesting User Name or Password information. If Glyde does inform you that your credit card is expiring, or requests an updated address, please go directly to glyde.com to provide the new information. If you receive a "phishing" email asking for your user information, or an email that you suspect is not from Glyde, please inform us by emailing us at [spam@glyde.com](mailto:spam@glyde.com). 

## Protecting Your Account

Your password is important because it serves as a key to access your account. Do not disclose your password to anyone. When selecting your password, use unique letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and characters. If you share your password or your personal information with others, you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account, and may jeopardize the security of your personal information. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately contact us at [service@glyde.com](mailto:service@glyde.com) and go to the website and change your password. 

You can see, review and change your personal information by logging in to glyde.com. Please keep your personal information up to date. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the Glyde User Agreement and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. 

## Security

Glyde uses multiple tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We work very hard to protect your privacy, but cannot guarantee, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

## Third Parties

This document addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Glyde collects from you, except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy. If you disclose your information to other people, or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information disclosed to them. Glyde does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

## General

Glyde may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect after they are posted on the site. If there are any material changes, we will notify you through email.
