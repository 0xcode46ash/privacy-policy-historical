# Privacy Policy

### Privacy

  
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information you submit to us. You may be asked to submit personal information about yourself in order to receive information or use services on our Website.  If you provide information to us, we will treat that information in accordance with this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").  By using this Website (and submitting personal information), you are accepting our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or submit any personal information.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and will remove it in the event that the purpose has been fulfilled or, if you no longer wish to continue being registered for our services. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely and otherwise in accordance with Data Protection legislation.

**Information collection and use  
** We request very little identifying information from you and only for a narrow set of purposes. Typically, identifying information is collected for:

1\. Registration to the Volunteer Programme – your title, name, email address, postal address, home and mobile numbers, age, gender, ethnicity and disability status will be collected. This information is stored to allow us to send information about Scotland's Commonwealth Games that may be of interest to you. Information relating to age, gender, ethnicity and disability status is treated as strictly confidential and will be used for statistical and equal opportunities monitoring purposes only.  This information is also stored on back-up tapes to avoid loss of data.

2\. Registration to the Commonwealth Games Business Portal – In order to tender for Games-related contracts, all potential suppliers need to pre-register certain business information through the Business Portal.  The registration process enables businesses to be “business ready” and streamlines the procurement process.  The registration also requires some personal information to be provided, including your title, name, mobile phone number and email address.  Please note that all such data provided by you on the Business Portal is processed by the Organising Committee.

3\. Registration to our recruitment portal – your title, name, email address, postal address, home and mobile numbers and any other

information that is within your CV and which is uploaded to the portal by you in relation to any recruitment opportunity will be collected.

4\. Email-a-friend – The recipient will receive an email from the address you entered in "your email address" and a URL linking to [www.glasgow2014.com](http://www.glasgow2014.com/).  None of the details you submit will be retained by Glasgow 2014 Limited.

5\. Contact us – Information is used to respond to queries and requests and is not retained by Glasgow 2014 Limited. It is possible, though unlikely, that we might be forced to disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order or other law enforcement agency's request.

Also, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web or that may be collectable in transit by others, including contractors who provide services to us.

**Third party Collection of Information  
** The Website contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**Data Protection Statement  
**

The Data Protection Act 1998 ("DPA") as amended from time to time regulates the processing of personal data, that is information about and relating to, living identifiable individuals.

Glasgow 2014 Limited is registered as a Data Controller with the Information Commissioner under the DPA and is committed to respecting your online privacy.  We will apply appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information you share with us. The level of protection will be based on an assessment of the harm that is likely to be caused by the loss or unauthorised disclosure of the personal information you give us.  The information you provide will be processed by Glasgow 2014 Limited in accordance with the DPA. The data you provide to us may be transfered to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who are contracted to us for the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

All personal information you provide is transferred via a secured connection. This is completed under 128 bit SSL (Secure Socket layer) encryption, which is a leading security standard for the transmission of data within the e-services industry.

Glasgow 2014 Limited will not disclose the personal information that you provide to any outside person or organisation except where required to do so by law or with your own consent.  Further information may be found in relation to data protection by visiting the Information Commissioner's Website.

**Access to Information/Delete/Unsubscribe**  
You have the right to access any personal information that you have submitted to us through the Website. We give you the following options for managing or removing your information from our database:

1\. Send us an email: [contactus@Glasgow2014.com](mailto:contactus@Glasgow2014.com). Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do.

2\. Write to us: Website Administrator, Glasgow 2014 Limited, Monteith House, 5th Floor, 11 George Square, Glasgow G2 1DY.  Be

sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do.

If you require us to supply you with details of the personal information that we hold about you, then a small charge will be made.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.  A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.  


When you visit the Website we send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in the following ways:

1\. To enable the personalisation features on the Website (which give you the ability to recall recently viewed pages and see information which you have input on line).

2\. To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use the Website and to help us improve the structure of the Website.

We cannot identify you personally in this way.

Two types of cookies may be used on the Website: session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website: and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

**Disabling/Enabling Cookies**  


You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of the Website if cookies are disabled.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  


If this Privacy Policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.

**How to Contact Us**  
If you have any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy for Glasgow 2014 Limited or its implementation, you may contact us at [contactus@Glasgow2014.com](mailto:contactus@Glasgow2014.com).  If at any time you decide that we should no longer hold any of your personal data, or wish to change the use to which any such data can be put, please let us know by emailing us at this address.
