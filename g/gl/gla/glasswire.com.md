# GlassWire Privacy Policy

**Commitment to Privacy**

GlassWire is committed to protecting your privacy by collecting only the minimum amount of information needed to provide our software, website, and services. Our company mission is to help people protect their privacy, data, and devices from threats.

**Does GlassWire see or collect my network or graph data?**

GlassWire does not ever see or collect any of your GlassWire network or graph data. Your network and graph data stays on your device and is never sent to our GlassWire servers. Our business model is to sell our premium GlassWire software, not to collect or sell your data to advertisers.

**What information does GlassWire collect?**

GlassWire collects information from you when you register on our website or forum, email us, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or download or install our software.

When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.

  * GlassWire Installation Process

When installing or uninstalling GlassWire’s desktop software, our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This helps us estimate how many users we have. If we did not count installs of GlassWire we wouldn’t know how many users we have. Thank you for allowing us to count you as a GlassWire user. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because we use the installation stats provided by the Google Play Android store.

After installing GlassWire for the PC you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day. GlassWire for the desktop checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date. Please note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users. We can never see your network data. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because it has no suspicious host lists and it updates through the Google Play Android store.

  * Google Analytics on GlassWire.com

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to check website stats. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

  * GlassWire Activation Codes (Desktop Only)

GlassWire Basic, Pro, Elite and other paid desktop products sometimes use activation codes to unlock GlassWire's paid features. When activating GlassWire Basic, Pro, or Elite the GlassWire software will contact GlassWire.com and check to see if the activation code should be authenticated or not and to see how many machines are using that code.
