**What information does this Web site gather?**

Glance collects personal information such as name, address, e-mail address and billing information when you knowingly provide it to us. Our Web servers or a third party web analytics company may automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as pages visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies), unless and until you sign up for a Glance account. If collected, we would use these statistics to monitor our site’s performance and to make it easier for you to use.

**What happens when I provide personal information on this Web site?**

When you supply information for a specific purpose such as ordering a service from Glance, we use the information for the purpose of providing that service. If the way we use personally identifiable information changes, Glance will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and giving you the opportunity to opt out of such use.

**What happens when I provide information to subscribe to the Glance service?**

When you choose to subscribe from Glance, we request accurate contact. You will be able to choose if your contact information is used to send you company and product information, special offers and/or newsletters.

If you’re a Glance customer, we store your name, purchase and usage history and billing information to allow you to manage your Glance account. Customers have access to their account information and usage history on-line. They can update their personal account information at any time by selecting “Account Info” from the Glance icon menu or by calling Glance Customer Service at 1-877-GLANCE-ME (1-877-452-6236).

As a subscriber, you may at any time:

  * **Opt out.**  At any time after the initial subscription, you can opt out by calling Glance Customer Service at 1-877-GLANCE-ME (1-877-452-6236) or e-mailing us at [glance@glance.net](mailto:glance@glance.net) with your request.
  * **Update**  your contact and personal information anytime by notifying us of changes to the information previously collected from you on-line by calling Glance Customer Service at 1-877-GLANCE-ME (1-877-452-6236) or e-mailing us at [glance@glance.net](mailto:glance@glance.net) with your request.



In order to improve your experience with us, we may decide to improve our site’s ability to obtain information about users. If we do, we will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

**Do you sell or give my information to non-Glance Networks, Inc. companies?**

No, we do not sell individually identifiable information obtained on-line about our visitors to anyone outside of Glance. The only exception to this rule is if we are required by law to release information.

If you provide individually identifiable information at an event Glance sponsors with another company, or if you subscribe or register on a co-sponsored or co-branded Web site, you may be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement on the co-branded site to learn how the partner uses this information. Be assured that Glance uses this information in accordance with this privacy policy.

On occasion, Glance shares non-personally identifiable information with non-Glance companies in order to assess the results of a promotion. This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you. Information could be shared with an authorized Glance reseller to fulfill a request for information or to follow up on an inquiry. We will inform you when your personally identifiable information is being shared and for what purposes.

Personal information submitted to Glance through this Site may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Glance its affiliates or authorized resellers maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Glance. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.

**What does Glance do with personally identifiable information?**

Personal information you voluntarily supply when obtaining information, purchasing services or interacting with our advertising may be shared with authorized resellers or affiliates of Glance.

However, you will be informed when such information is shared and will be given an opportunity to opt out. Should any changes be made in the way we use personally identifiable information, Glance will contact you via e-mail notifying you of this change and give you the opportunity to choose to opt out of such use.

## **Cookie Policy**

Our Site and Service use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Site. This helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse the Site and also allows us to improve our Site.

Due to recent changes in law, all Web sites which operate across certain parts of the European Union are required to obtain consent using or storing cookies (or similar technologies) on your computers or mobile device. This cookie policy provides you with clear and comprehensive information about the cookies we use and the purposes for using them. For further information about this policy, please contact [glance@glance.net](mailto:glance@glance.net).

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or other device. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our Site or use the Services.

**Key concepts**

**First and third-party cookies:** whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a Web site that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by glance.net). Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the Web site being visited by the user. If a user visits a Web site and another entity sets a cookie through that Web site, this would be a third-party cookie.

**Persistent cookies:** these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the Web site that created that particular cookie.

**Session cookies:** these cookies allow Web site operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

**How to delete and block our cookies**

You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our Site.

**Changing your cookie settings**

Please note that Internet browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings are usually found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your Internet browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful. Otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your Internet browser for more details.

**Can I withdraw my consent?**

If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you will need to delete your cookies using your Internet browser settings. For further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please visit: [http://www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

**Your consent**

By continuing to use the Site or the Services, you are agreeing to our placing cookies on your computer or other device in order to analyze the way you use the Site and in order for us to provide the Services. Please read this cookie policy carefully for more details about the information we collect when you use this Site and the Services. If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of this Site or Services, you must stop using our Site and Services.

**What cookies do we use and why?**

To find out about specific cookies we use, please see below.

The cookies used are categorized as follows:

  * Strictly necessary
  * Performance
  * Functionality



**Strictly necessary**

‘Strictly necessary’ cookies let you move around the Web site and use essential features like participating in a Glance co-browse session.  Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.  Please note that these cookies do not gather any information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the Internet.

We use these strictly necessary cookies to:

  * Identify you as being logged into our Web site
  * Know when you are connected to an active Glance session



Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the Service, so if you prevent these cookies we cannot guarantee your use of our Service, nor how the security on our Service will perform during your visit.

**Performance**

‘Performance’ cookies collect information about how you use the Site – e.g. which pages you visit and if you experience any errors. These cookies do not collect any information that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how the Site and Services work, understand what interests our users and measure how effective our content is.

We use performance cookies for:

  * Web analytics: To provide anonymous statistics on how the Services are used
  * Error management: To help us improve the Services by measuring any errors that occur.



Some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties. However, we don’t allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above. By using the Services, you accept the use of ‘Performance’ cookies. Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the Services, so if you prevent them we cannot guarantee how our Services will perform for you.

**Functionality**

‘Functionality” cookies are used to provide services or to remember settings to improve your visit.  These cookies are only placed on your hard drive if the related functionality is used.

We use functionality cookies for several purposes:

  * Remember the Glance Address you choose for a free trial, to simplify logging into the Web site and subscribing later on
  * Some session hosts ask guests to enter their name, email or phone prior to joining the host’s session.  A cookie on the guest’s browser stores this information, so the fields can be pre-populated in subsequent sessions.
