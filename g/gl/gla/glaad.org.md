# GLAAD: Privacy Policy

Constituent Privacy Statement

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) is committed to protecting the privacy of our constituents. We have created this policy to outline our policy for the protection and use of personal information collected through our website, direct marketing, special events, or other interactions with GLAAD.

We define personal information as information that can be linked to a specific individual (e.g. name, address, phone number, e-mail address or any other information provided to us by members or website users).

_How we use the information gathered when you sign up to become a member of GLAAD or use GLAAD's on-line services._

GLAAD gathers contact information when you register on glaad.org; contribute to GLAAD on-line, by mail, or on the telephone; when you participate in an event; or contact GLAAD. We use this information to send GLAAD and LGBT-related action alerts, event invitations, updates, press releases as well as information about GLAAD's programmatic accomplishments and initiatives, volunteer opportunities, membership and renewal appeals.

GLAAD complies fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). GLAAD does not knowingly collect identifiable personal information from children under age 13. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems. We are unable to reply to information requests from children under the age of 13, if so identified. A parent or guardian must initiate any requests for information from children under the age of 13 on their behalf. We encourage parents to supervise children when they browse the Internet.

GLAAD does not specifically ask children under 18 for any information and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about them.

GLAAD also gathers aggregate information about website usage. Our web server automatically records the domain name and Internet Protocol (IP) address of each visitor to our site. We collect and analyze this information, which helps us determine which pages are most frequently visited, to improve the site and its resources for our visitors. GLAAD does not track individual usage of our website.

GLAAD will occasionally exchange personal information with other organizations through promotions, partnerships or otherwise. You may choose to withhold your personal information from exchange by selecting that option in your account settings on www.glaad.org, or by e-mailing [membership@glaad.org](mailto:membership@glaad.org).

_How your information is protected._

GLAAD holds your personal information to the highest level of confidence and security. Our website is securely protected against the loss, theft, misuse or misrepresentation of information under our control. Access to GLAAD's database information is limited only to specific qualified GLAAD employees. Additionally, when you make a contribution to GLAAD on-line, your financial information is transmitted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser encrypt, or scramble, data before being sent to our payment processor.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information to the fullest extent, we cannot ensure or completely guarantee the security of such information.

We take the utmost precaution to keep your credit card information safe and secure. But if you are uncomfortable submitting your credit card information online, you can also contribute to GLAAD by printing out the online form and mailing it to:

**Member Services**  
GLAAD  
5455 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1500  
Los Angeles, CA 90036-4204

_How to unsubscribe from mailing lists._

To remove your name from our email or postal mailing list please call Membership Services at 323.933.2240 or email [membership@glaad.org](mailto:membership@glaad.org) indicating what type of communication you received from us and at what address.

_Acceptance of Constituent Privacy Policy_

To further our mission and better serve our constituents, GLAAD is continually improving and adding new functionality and features to our Web site and improving and adding to its existing services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes and the changing nature of technology, GLAAD's information practices will change from time to time. 

If and when its information practices change, GLAAD will post the policy changes to its Web site to notify its constituents of the changes and, where appropriate and practical, give them the opportunity to "opt-out" of the new programs and practices. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please check back at the GLAAD site frequently or contact Membership Services at 323.933.2240.

_How to contact GLAAD with questions, comments or concerns regarding privacy issues._
