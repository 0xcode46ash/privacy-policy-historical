4\. Under what circumstances does Glubble transfer Personal Data?

Except as provided below, Glubble will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any Personal Data to any third party without your explicit permission.

Glubble may disclose Personal Data of a User Account if Glubble believes in good faith that Glubble is required to do so by law, or that doing so is necessary to comply with legal process, law enforcement agencies, respond to claims, or protect our rights in or the safety of the Services, or to protect the safety or rights of other Users or Child Users.

Glubble may share Personal Data with its affiliates.

If Glubble offers contests, sweepstakes, and other similar features, the co-sponsor and/or the sweepstakes’ or contests’ administrators may have access to the Personal Data that you submit in your entry. If you do not wish for us to share such personally identifiable information with our sweepstakes or contest co-sponsors or administrators, please do not enter any contests or sweepstakes on Glubble.

To provide you with the Services, Glubble may sometimes, as necessary, share your Personal Data with partner service providers and/or agents, for example the third party banking organization or other providers of payment services. Glubble requires these third parties to take organizational and technical measures to protect your Personal Data and to observe applicable legal requirements. Please be informed that, notwithstanding this, in the unlikely event of an applicable governmental authority requesting Glubble or Glubble’s local partner responsible to such authority, to retain and provide Personal Data, or to install equipment in order to intercept User Communications, Glubble and/or its local partner will, to the extent required to do so by law, provide necessary assistance and information to fulfill such a request.

Glubble may use non-personally identifiable aggregated data and make it available to third parties. This aggregated data is used by Glubble or its partners to track traffic use, to gauge interest in certain features, to improve the Service or for other business or marketing purposes.

Personal Data that is collected may be stored and processed in any country in which Glubble and its affiliates and contractors maintain facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Glubble reserves the right to transfer and store your Personal Data outside of your country of residence. By using the Service you consent to any such transfer and storage of Personal Data outside of your country of residence.

As Glubble continues to develop its business, Glubble might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, as well as in the event Glubble or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Data of Users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. Glubble reserves the right to include such Personal Data, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party. Additionally, information about Members may be disclosed as part of a bankruptcy.

10\. Kids’ Privacy Policy

PLEASE READ: This section of the Privacy Policy explains our information collection and use practices online for children under the age of 13. Glubble asks that you take the time to review our policy so that you can know exactly what information Glubble collects (and doesn’t) from children under 13. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at support@glubble.com.

a. What Information does Glubble collect from Children Under 13?

Glubble is firmly committed to protecting the privacy rights of children and specifically those rights as outlined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Glubble will not collect, use or save data from children under the age of 13 without the express consent of the child’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

Child Members can use the Add on, explore the Library, view Content, and participate in activities without submitting any Personal Data. Glubble will not ask a Child Member for any personally identifiable information, such as his or her name, e-mail address, phone number, etc.

When Glubble does collect information from Child Members using the Service, Glubble generally limits its collection to information that does not personally identify the Child Member. Glubble never collects more information from Child Members than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the activity.

Assessment Data is collected when a Child Member is accessing or viewing content.

There may be some other activities that require Child Members to submit individually identifiable information in order to participate, such as promotions, sweepstakes or contests, or other activities such as newsletters or sending online postcards or e-mail messages. Glubble will notify you, via the e-mail address associated with your Account, and will identify your child to you by using his or her Screen Name that your child wishes to participate. Glubble will only collect your child’s name, mailing address, and other personally identifiable information from you, the parent, and not from your child. The information will not be used for any purpose and the information will not be used after the promotion or activity is complete. Co-sponsors and/or sweepstakes’, contests’ or activity administrators may have access to the personally identifiable information that is submitted. If you do not wish for us to share this personally identifiable information with sweepstakes, contest or activity co-sponsors or administrators, please do not enter your child in any contests or sweepstakes on Glubble.

Glubble won’t knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to register as a Member or otherwise submit more individually identifiable information than Glubble describes above, except with verifiable parental/legal guardian consent. If Glubble becomes aware that Glubble has inadvertently received individually identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, except as discussed above, Glubble will delete the information from our records as soon as Glubble discovers it.

Glubble also offers memberships to certain licensed pre-schools and other educational institutions, who in turn make the Service available to children under the age of 13. No individually identifiable information is collected from children who access the Glubble Service via these school Accounts.

b. How does Glubble use Personal Data of Child Members?

Glubble always collects Personal Data only from you, as the parent or legal guardian, and never knowingly from a Child Member. Glubble will only use that information for the express purpose for which it was collected and will only disclose that Personal Data as set forth below.

Except as set forth below, Glubble does not share Personal Data of Child Members with any third parties (except those parties that help us administer the Services) without a parent’s express consent. These third parties may not use the information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information.

Glubble may disclose Personal Data of a Child Member if Glubble believes in good faith that Glubble is required to do so by law, or that doing so is necessary to comply with legal process, law enforcement agencies, respond to claims, or protect our rights in or the safety of the Services, or to protect the safety or rights of other Members or Child Members.

Glubble may share Child Member Personal Data with its affiliates.

Glubble may use non-personally identifiable aggregated data and make it available to third parties. This aggregated data is used by Glubble or its partners to track traffic use, to gauge interest in certain features, to improve the Service or for other business or marketing purposes.

Personal Data of Child Members that is collected may be stored and processed in any country in which Glubble and its affiliates and contractors maintain facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Glubble reserves the right to transfer and store Personal Data of Child Members outside of their country of residence. By opening a Child Account, you consent to any such transfer and storage of Personal Data outside of the Child’s country of residence.

As Glubble continues to develop its business, Glubble might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, as well as in the event Glubble or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Data of Child Members will generally be one of the transferred business assets. Glubble reserves the right to include such Personal Data, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party. Additionally, information about Child Members may be disclosed as part of a bankruptcy.

c. Tracking and Content Recommendations

If you are setting up one or more Child Accounts, you are encouraged to set up an unidentifiable, anonymous screen name for each Child Member. Glubble may give you the ability to track the Child Member’s use of the Service (which may include allowing you to see what Content the Child Member is viewing, reading, and learning and, where applicable, performance metrics), as well as receive content and other recommendations based upon the Child Member’s use and progress. Glubble may also make content recommendations based upon previous usage of the Services, as well as your child’s appropriate grade range.

11\. Parent’s Rights

Glubble wants you to be comfortable with what your child is doing when using Glubble. Therefore, you may contact us at any time regarding privacy questions or concerns, or to request to review what Personal Data Glubble has collected from you or about Child Members.

If you would like to exercise your right to view, correct, complete or remove your Personal Data, please contact Glubble at privacy@Glubble.com. Within a reasonable period of time and upon verification of your identity, Glubble will fulfill your request, provided Glubble will not act contrary to applicable legal requirements in fulfilling your request.

You may also contact us at any time to request that Glubble delete your or your Child Members’ Personal Data and/or refuse to permit further collection or use of your or your Child Members’ information. Glubble will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child’s information is that child’s parent or legal guardian.
