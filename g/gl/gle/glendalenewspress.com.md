# Glendale News-Press: Privacy Policy

GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. Please note this policy applies only to information collected by GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM online and does not impact information collected or used by GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM or its affiliates through other means.

**Information We Collect**

What information we collect and store depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, when we prompt you to provide personal information as part of an e-commerce transaction or to register for access to portions of our site, we may collect and store that information. We use such Personally Identifiable Information only in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. We will use your information only as permitted by law. 

We also collect what is known as “Aggregated Information.” An example of such information is information about your usage patterns combined with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive to our users. Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but it cannot be used to contact you individually. 

Like most Web sites, GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may not be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology. A “cookie” is a small file or part of a file stored on your computer, created and subsequently read by a Web site server, that contains information regarding your use of pages visited. In conjunction with our use of cookies, we may install one or more data agents on all pages of GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM; such data agents may be in the form of a clear .gif, not visible to users, that allows the cookies to be dropped on users’ computers. Cookie technology allows us to store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit. It may also control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password. It may also prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences.

**How We Use This Information And Who We Share It With**

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, products and services offered by GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM and other Los Angeles Times affiliates and partners, administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing of e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM may also used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service, for example) may access such information.

As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of monies you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM expects its business partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to or view certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. 

While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may also use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM does not control the use of such technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. 

Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications to you from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM and this policy.

**Your choice to opt out**

The quality news and information on GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM is supported by advertising revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online publishing business. Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you are given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose: for example, when registering as a GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM member. If you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. If you would like to change your preferences regarding e-mail communications, or to change any of your Personally Identifiable Information, you may contact us at feedback@GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM.

For subscribers to The PAPER NAMEwho manage their accounts through myaccount.GLENDALENEWSPRESS.COM, your e-mail address is your member log-in.

You will be notified and given an opportunity to opt out if we do so.
