At McGraw-Hill Education, we are committed to protecting your privacy.

Please read on to learn how the McGraw-Hill Education portal site implements that policy.

**McGraw-Hill School Education Group Privacy Notice**

What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you submit an online form to request a catalog, to respond to a survey, or to communicate with us for any other reason through a McGraw-Hill School Education Group website, the information we collect from you (e.g., your name, address, email address) is added to our electronic mailing list so that we may notify you, our customer, of updates to our Web sites or of products and services that may be of interest to you. If you place an order with us, you will receive transactional email updates regarding your order, even if you did not enroll in an email update service, or have unsubscribed from an email update service. We only use the credit card or payment information we acquire from you to fulfill your order. This information will be maintained in a secure database in the U.S. and accessed only by authorized persons.

Occasionally, and subject to applicable laws, McGraw-Hill School Education Group also makes contact information available to other business units within The McGraw-Hill Companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. From time to time, we may also share your information with outside vendors who will be authorized to use this information solely to perform services (such as a "mailing" house) on our behalf. McGraw-Hill School Education Group does not share information we collect from you with companies outside the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies.

What about Cookies?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive or in its memory. Some areas of the McGraw-Hill Education Web site may use cookies and our subscription products use "session" cookies; in those areas, an explanation of the use of cookies can be reached by clicking on the Privacy Notice links on the affected Web pages. A "session" cookie is a cookie that is erased when a visitor's browser closes.

Customers may choose not to accept cookies. In order to change cookie preferences, you must change your browser's preferences to disable or delete cookies.

Please check with your browser's specific company for more information. Some examples of how to change your browser's preferences are as follows: In Internet Explorer (versions 6 and up), this option is listed under Tools > Internet Options > Privacy. The setting has to be set to Block All Cookies; In Netscape (versions 7 and up), this option is listed under Edit > Preferences > Privacy & Security > Cookies. The Disable Cookies button should be checked.

What about IP addresses

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from MHE, our services log the visitors' IP addresses. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.

Parents and Kids under 13

We encourage you to spend time online with your kids. No information should be submitted to or posted to MHE by children under 13 years of age. Children 13 and over can participate in providing us with feedback.
