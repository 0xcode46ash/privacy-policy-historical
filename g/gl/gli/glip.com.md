# Glip - Privacy

Here is our Privacy Policy. On the left we tell you everything you need to know about it. On the right we tell you the gist of it, so that you can just scan it and know what we mean. The stuff on the left is the official policy, and that is what you should review if you want every little tiny detail. If you just kinda want to know how we operate, you can just spend a minute on the right column and get a feel for it. 

**Welcome to Glip** We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy (Policy) describes how we collect, use and disclose information that we obtain when you visit our website at glip.com (Website) and/or use our applications and services (collectively, the Services or Glip).

As used in this Policy, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and the like refer to Glip, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and the terms “you”, “your” and the like refer to you, the end-user of our Website and Services. This Policy applies to all Glip applications, technologies and services used by you whether your use is on a computer, mobile device, tablet or other platform.

By using or accessing the Website or the Services, you acknowledge and accept the practices described in this Policy. We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Website or Services constitutes your acceptance of the Policy then in effect. For this reason, you should review the Policy from time to time to ensure that you understand and are willing to accept our current privacy practices. ‬

| 

This tells you that if you decide to use Glip, you accept the terms of this privacy policy. And we means Glip, and you means you, and this is the deal.  
  
**Ownership‬** Our Services are designed to provide communication, collaboration, and sharing services‬ to anyone who has an email address with your company’s domain. For instance, if your work at Acme, Inc., and your email is xxxx@acme.com, you will be able to connect with anyone within the domain, and anyone with an email address on that domain will be able to join Glip and share basic information with other Acme, Inc. employees. The data shared by users on Glip belongs to the person or company who owns or has licensed the domain in question (the Owner).‬‬‬‬

The Owner will have certain administrative rights within Glip, which may include the management of users and data within the Services. The Owner will likely have its own security and privacy policies, in addition to those Glip has implemented. Before signing up or using Glip, you should make sure that the use of Glip is permitted by your employer or other organization for which you intend to use Glip. We are not responsible for any such unauthorized use. All privacy related concerns relating to the use of Glip should be directed to the Owner.

‬  | 

This tells you that the person or organization who owns the domain where your email address lives gets to decide who can use Glip, and under what conditions, within that domain. We at Glip don’t have any say about the stuff you put up there.   
  
**Customer‬ Data‬** Customer‬ Data is all the data that is uploaded and/or shared on Glip by any user. This includes any conversations, files, schedules, tasks, or any other content type. ‬ We collect the e-mail addresses of individuals who communicate with us via e-mail, collect information on what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by the user. This may include, but is not limited to things like consumer survey information and/or site registrations. 

We make no claim of ownership in your Customer Data. Except as provided in this Policy or other written agreements relating to Glip, we only use Customer Data to provide and improve the Services. We don’t share or sell your Customer Data with anyone, except in these very‬ limited cases:‬‬‬‬

  * To prevent fraudulent transactions. 
  * As required by law, it may also be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. 
  * Under special circumstances we may disclose personally identifiable information, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate our Terms of Service. 
  * When working with third parties to enhance our Services. We will require the third parties to comply with this Privacy Policy in these cases. 
  * As part of any due diligence process if we are to enter into a merger or acquisition transaction, under a confidentiality agreement. 

| 

Here we tell you that we don’t own the stuff you put into Glip; you do. And we only use what you share with us to make Glip better, to stop bad or illegal things from happening, or if we get together or get bought by another company and they need to see it to make sure they understand what’s there, but only if they promise to keep it confidential.  
  
**Contact‬ Data** Contact‬ Data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other information that users have shared on Glip in order to make the Services work properly. Contact Data provided by users is available to other users within Glip operating within your domain, or to external users when invited by someone within your domain.‬ ‬Glip is a communication platform, and therefore, we use the Contact Data to enable better communication within the Services. We will encourage users to communicate by providing them Contact Data of other users within your domain, as appropriate. ‬We may also use Contact Data to complete the transactions you request, administer your account, improve the Services and detect and prevent fraud. We may also use Contact Data to contact you to provide you with information about the Services, including information about security or other technical issues, or to request feedback or input. ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬

| 

In order to communicate with others in Glip, everybody must share some contact information, and we will make that available to other authorized Glip users. We will also use the contact data to let you know what’s going on or to ask you for feedback.  
  
**Usage‬ and Support Data‬** We‬ may use data derived from your use of the Services to analyze general patterns or other statistically interesting trends that will help us improve our Services. Usage data includes, for example, aggregated quantitative information about active users, activity, topics, and groups. Some ways we use the usage data include operating, improving and personalizing the Services and our offerings. We do not disclose identifiable individual or company data to anyone, except to provide reports to you or others in your organization. 

Support Data is the information we collect when you submit a support request or run an automated troubleshooter, including information about hardware, software, and other details related to the support incident, such as: contact or authentication information, chat session personalization, information about the condition of the computer and the application when the fault occurred and during diagnostics, system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations, and error-tracking files.

Support may be provided through phone, e-mail, or otherwise. We use Support Data in the same way as we use your information, as described in this Policy. Additionally, we use it to resolve your support incident and for training purposes. 

| 

We may combine your data with other folks data to learn about patterns or trends to improve Glip, but we will not tell anyone about you, specifically, unless the information is requested by you or your organization.   
  
**General** In addition to the uses described above, we may use the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information that we collect:

  * To develop, offer and deliver our products and services, to offer products and services of our corporate affiliates, partners, and other companies. 
  * To conduct market research, project planning, troubleshoot problems, detect and protect against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce our terms of use and for other purposes, as otherwise set forth in this Policy and as otherwise authorized by you. 
  * To notify you via email about special offers or other products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also contact you and deliver information to you that may be targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, and product offering communications. You will always be able to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our emails or other communications. 
  * If we enter into a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy, we may sell, transfer, assign or license some or all of our assets to a third party, which assets may include your personal information that we have collected. 

| 

We may use what we know about you to offer you products we think you will like, to learn more about your needs, or to stop bad things from happening. When we contact you, it will probably be by email. We may also share the information we have if we get together or get bought by another company.   
  
**Cookies‬‬** We send cookies, which are a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier,‬ to your users’ browser to be able to identify who they are, and personalize the service for them. Cookies are required to use Glip.‬‬‬‬ You can always disable cookies on your browser, but then you will not be able to use Glip.

| 

We use cookies because they make Glip easier to use. You can always turn off or delete your cookies if that is not ok with you (but then Glip won't work).  
  
**Storage and Security‬‬‬‬‬** Glip uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Glip. Glip owns all intellectual property rights relating to Glip software application and the Services. You retain all rights to your data that you provide to us pursuant to your use of Glip.‬‬‬‬‬

Your data may be stored in servers located in the United States or in any other country, depending‬ on decisions made by Glip or our storage providers. We take reasonable precautions — including technical, administrative and physical measures — to safeguard your information. We use technical safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption. Your account information including email address is located on a secured server behind a firewall. We authorize access to personally identifiable information, including email addresses, only for those employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We also enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files. 

| 

We use other companies to store all the information in the cloud. We own the software, and you own the data you shared with us. We don’t exactly know in what physical location the information is stored, but we use reputable companies for storage and cloud services and work really hard to protect your stuff.   
  
**Accessing, Correcting and Deleting Your Information** You may access, correct or delete Customer Data or Contact Data you have provided to us by using the tools within the Services (for example, editing your profile information on the Service) or by contacting support at support@glip.com. Changes you make to your information on the Service take immediate effect on your network, but data will be retained in secure storage for a limited period afterward as part of our standard data backup process.

| 

You can always change or delete data that belongs to you, and ask us to help you do that. We are happy to help.  
  
**Changes to this Privacy Policy‬‬‬‬‬** We‬ will from time to time update this Privacy Policy to reflect customer feedback, changes in our Services, and updates to applicable data privacy laws and regulations. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of the document. If there are material changes to this Policy, we will notify you.‬‬‬‬

| 

As things change, we may change this document, too. We will let you know if we change it a lot.  
  
**Children** In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide access to our Website or Services to, or collect any personally identifiable information from, persons under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of 13, you may not register an account with us. If we learn that a user is under the age of thirteen (13), we will take appropriate steps to remove the user's information from the database and restrict the individual from future access to our Services.
