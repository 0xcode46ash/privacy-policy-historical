# Gymboree.com - Customer Service: Privacy and Security

Privacy & Security

  
Gymboree values you as a customer and respects your privacy. We collect certain information from you that allows us to customize and enhance your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We are committed to managing this information responsibly so that you are in control of your personal information and the communications you receive from us. 

  
This policy describes the personal information we collect from you and why; how we use this information; when we share this information with third parties; the choices you can make about how your personal information is collected, used and/or shared; and the data security, accuracy and access measures we have adopted to protect your information under our control from loss, misuse or alteration. 

This policy applies solely to information collected by one of The Gymboree Corporation’s brands, including Gymboree, Gymboree Play & Music, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 (collectively, “Gymboree” or “we” or “us”). This policy does not apply to the practices of people that Gymboree does not employ or companies that Gymboree does not own or operate (including Gymboree Play & Music Play Centers that are independently owned and operated by franchisees). 

Please be aware that our web sites may contain links to other sites hosted by third parties. Gymboree does not control and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices and policies of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave one of our web sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information from you. 

  
You can visit our web sites or locations without telling us who you are or revealing any other personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which you visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless and until you identify yourself to us. 

Gymboree collects personally identifiable information from you when you sign in on one of our web sites, register for on-line shopping, place an order, enroll your child in a Play & Music Class, participate in a contest, promotion or survey, or request other services that require information, registration or subscription. This information may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card numbers, gender, occupation, personal interests and your child’s date of birth. We may also keep a record of your product interests and purchases on-line and in our stores, and automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser (including your Internet domain address, Gymboree cookie information, and the page you requested). 

Whether or not you provide any of your personal information is your own choice. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products or access certain services, offers and content on our web sites, from our catalogs (if we so choose to distribute catalogs) or at our locations. 

  
Gymboree uses customer information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see on our sites; to fulfill your requests for certain products and services (e.g. shipping your order to you; process your credit card); and to contact you about new products or services, special events and promotions. We use Internet domain addresses for internal purposes to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Gymboree typically will not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, but reserves the right to do so in order to identify a user when we feel this is necessary to enforce compliance with our internal policies or the Gymboree Terms of Use (available on our web sites) or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 

  
Gymboree may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: we have your consent to share such information; we need to share such information to notify contest winners or fulfill promotional obligations, we need to share such information with companies that work on behalf of Gymboree or are Gymboree franchisees in order for them to provide a product or service you have requested (sometimes known as service providers); we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or we find that your actions on one of our web sites violate the Gymboree Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. We prohibit our service providers from using your information except to the extent necessary to fulfill their services to us. 

We may combine information you give us online or in our stores. We may also combine such information with publicly available information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. We may also share or cross-reference, or cause to be shared or cross-referenced, such information, including your personally identifiable information, with unrelated companies you may be interested in so that the companies can directly market their products or services to you. 

In the event that some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we would transfer your information to the buyer or transferee. 

  
You may, at any time, access, verify, correct, update or remove your e-mail information and preferences on-line at [www.gymboree.com](http://www.gymboree.com/). You may, at any time, access, verify, correct, update or remove your home address by contacting our Customer Support Team by e-mail at [customer_service@gymboree.com](mailto:%20customer_service@gymboree.com) or by telephone at 1-877-4-GYMWEB (1-877-449-6932). In addition, if you prefer not to receive information from us, please let us know by sending us an e-mail or calling our Customer Support Team at the above address or number. Please note that it may take up to two weeks for your request to become effective. Thereafter, when you make purchases, we may still send you an e-mail confirmation and may need to contact you by phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have questions regarding your order. 

  
Gymboree is concerned about the safety and security of children when they use the Internet. Our web sites are general audience sites. We will not knowingly accept personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 must ask a parent or guardian for permission before providing any personal information online. 

  
A “cookie” is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would only have to log in a password once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies permit us to track and target your interests in order to enhance your experience on our web sites. We do not save passwords or credit card information in cookies. 

Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Gymboree’s cookies. We may allow business partners to set and access their own cookies on your computer. In such cases, however, Gymboree has no access to or control over such cookies. In addition, we may contract with a third party who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf. These third parties are prohibited by our terms of engagement with them from sharing your information with anyone other than us. 

  
Gymboree takes the security of your information very seriously. As a result, we do not accept orders by e-mail. We will gladly accept your orders on-line or by phone at 1-877-4-GYMWEB (1-877-449-6932). Our Customer Service hours are Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Pacific Time. 

Your Gymboree account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Gymboree will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information. Remember to sign out of your Gymboree account and close your browser window when you have completed your shopping to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information. 

In addition, when you submit sensitive information via one of our web sites, such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted and protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. 

If at any time you believe the security of your password or account information has been compromised, please notify Gymboree Customer Service Team at the telephone number above or change your member information on-line. Should you discover an unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you should immediately notify your card provider in accordance with the terms of your agreement with that company. 

  
Gymboree reserves the right to change, modify or amend this policy from time to time without prior notice to you. We will post the changes here. Gymboree encourages you to periodically review this policy to be informed of how we collect, use and protect your information. 

  
If you would like to contact us for any reason regarding our privacy policy and practices, please write us at Gymboree 500 Howard Street, San Francisco CA 94105, Attention: Web Management Team, or e-mail us at [customer_service@gymboree.com](mailto:%20customer_service@gymboree.com). 

This Policy is effective as of July 2007.
