# Privacy Policy GPS Review

As most websites do, we collect data in a “log file” record keeping. We collect things like your IP address, the browser you are using, which pages you visited, and which page you came from. We also use cookies to store information such as your personal preferences. For example if you submit a comment we will try to remember your name so you don’t have to fill it out again, or if you login to some of our features such as the forums, we’ll remember your login information through a cookie. Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies if you don’t want them used, however some of our website features require them.

We also use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. They may not use your name, address, email address, nor telephone number from these visits.

As an example, we use advertisements from Google on this website. They may store a cookie on your computer which enables them to serve relevant advertisements to you based on your visits here and on other websites. You may opt out of Google’s DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). You may opt out of Shopzilla targeted advertising by visiting [Shopzilla Opt Out](http://www.shopzilla.com/ad_retarget_global_opt_out).
