# Sicher FAQ

Your privacy is a top priority for us. We do our best to ensure all data sent via Sicher is protected against unauthorised access at all times.

SHAPE provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using Sicher.

## Sending Messages and Data

All messages and data (pictures, voice messages, files) sent via Sicher are protected with [asymmetric point-to-point encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). It means no third party, including SHAPE GmbH as a service operator, can decrypt messages, files or their metadata. Only the owner of original private key can decrypt received messages. No messages or files are ever sent unencrypted.

Additionally all data exchange between mobile apps and Sicher servers is protected using [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL).

Encrypted messages are deleted from our servers as soon as they have been delivered. Encrypted data (pictures, voice messages, files) access time is defined by the message self-destruction timer value, but in any case not more than 14 days.

On mobile devices all messages, received files and metadata are encrypted before saving them to internal storage. These items are decrypted in memory only when app needs to present them to a user. Items can be temporarily saved to a local storage upon opening them in another application.

Application passcode is used as a key to [symmetric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) encryption, protecting locally saved data. Anyone who gets access to your mobile device will not be able to decrypt stored messages and files unless he/she knows the passcode.

We recommend setting a device-level password in all cases. It gives an additional level of security, especially on iPhone and iPod Touch where hardware encryption is used in this case.

## Address Book 

Sicher periodically synchronizes your address book with its servers to find your contacts who have joined the service. It means sending contact names and phone numbers to server, where they are matched against existing service users. This data is not stored on servers. Only matching contacts are added to your contact list, all other data is deleted.

Address Book data transmission is also protected by SSL.

## No Traces

Sicher does not collect, aggregate, upload or in any other way pass your personally identifiable or non-identifiable information to third parties. We don't send crash logs, don't track usage statistics, don't use any advertising engines or social network SDKs. Any network communication is secure and carried out only to perform effective functions of the application.

## Disclosure

We do not share your personally identifiable information (phone number) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use. We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information only if required to do so by law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
