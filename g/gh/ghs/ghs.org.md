# Greenville Health System Privacy Policy - Greenville Health System

#### June 1, 2010

Greenville Health System makes every effort to keep your medical information private. Click a PDF of the[privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/upload/docs/Privacy_practices.pdf).(PDF).

The Greenville Health System (GHS) makes every effort to keep your health information private. Each time you visit a GHS facility (doctor’s office, clinic, hospital, or outpatient center), a record is made. This health or medical record often includes your symptoms, exams and tests, diagnoses, treatment, and care plan. We need this record to give you high-quality care and to meet legal requirements. 

This Notice of Privacy Practices applies to all health records produced at GHS, including those received from other providers. It outlines how we may use and give out information about you for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, and other purposes granted or required by law. It also describes your rights to get and control your record, and legal requirements we have on its use and release. 

This Notice applies to all GHS sites including offices of physicians employed by GHS and to all physicians and other healthcare providers who provide you with healthcare services at any GHS site. It does not apply to care you receive from physicians or other healthcare providers at their private offices (unless the physician or other healthcare provider is employed by GHS) or at any non-GHS site. 

The law requires GHS to do the following: 

  * Keep your health record private
  * Describe our legal duties and privacy obligations related to your health information
  * Follow the current Notice of Privacy Practices



We reserve the right to change the practices and terms of this Notice, and the changes will be effective for the information we already have about you as well as any information we receive in the future. The Notice will list the start date in the top right-hand corner of the first page. Each time you register at or are admitted to GHS as an inpatient or outpatient, you may have a copy of this Notice. We will post it in our facilities and on our Web site (ghs.org). You may also call our Privacy Office at 864-797-7755 for a copy.

## Routine Uses and Disclosures of Your Health Record

The following sections describe how we use and release medical information. Each section explains what we mean and gives a few examples. (Note: These examples are not all-inclusive.)

We use medical information about you to provide, coordinate, and manage your treatment or services. We maygive this information to doctors, nurses, technicians, students of affiliated healthcare programs, volunteers, orother staff who care for you. Various units may share information about you to coordinate your needs, such aslab work or drugs.

We may give details about you to people who are involved in your care, such as a specialist, spouse, or friend.GHS medical personnel and employees, using their best judgment, may release to a relative, close friend, or otherperson information about your health related to that person’s involvement in your care.

Here is how your health record might be used for treatment reasons:

  * A doctor treating your broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes, which slows healing. Also, the doctor may need to tell the dietitian that you have diabetes to arrange for special meals.
