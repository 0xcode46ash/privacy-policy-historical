GCRUISE Privacy Policy

 **We are committed to protecting our users privacy!**

We offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to GCruise or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.  


  


Traffic Data

Each time a visitor comes to a GCruise.com web site, our servers -- like most on the web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a GCruise.com web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the GCruise.com sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.  


  


Use of GCruise.com Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. 

Other companies which place advertising on our site may also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that GCruise.com does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are.  


  


Promotion

From time to time, GCruise.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. GCruise may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and GCruise.com will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.  


  


Profiles

GCruise.com encourages users to fill out their profiles as completely as possible, with the understanding that the specific individual shall remain anonymous. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals at any time.  


  


Our commitment to children's privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of GCruise is structured to attract anyone under 18 years of age.  


  


Other disclosure of personal information

GCruise.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, e-notes, video chat room, or other public forum within GCruise.  


  


Other sites

GCruise.com contains links to other sites on the web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other web sites.  


  


Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?

If you have any further questions or concerns about GCruise's privacy policies and use of personal information, please contact us via the contact form on the site.
