# Privacy Statement at GCF Global Learning®

## Privacy Statement

Privacy protection is important at GCF Global Learning®, and we make sure that your personal information remains confidential. Please take a moment to read the following statement to learn how we handle your personal information.

GCF Global Learning® is administered by Goodwill Industries of Eastern North Carolina, Inc, a 501(c)(3), tax-exempt organization. Our mission is to "provide an environment for people to improve the quality of their lives through employment and learning opportunities with a focus on persons with disabilities."

Every six months, GCF Global Learning® compiles information about its training program in order to evaluate the curriculum and make improvements. We share this information with those who donate to and support our programs. The information that we share, however, is a summation of all learners who participate and it does not reveal confidential information about any individual person. 

##### Information Release

GCF Global Learning® recognizes the importance of an individual's privacy and does not release individual records to outside agencies for any reason. Members have access to their own class records and are responsible for their release. Learner records are stored in a secure database for a minimum of seven years.

##### Marketing Use

At times, GCF Global Learning® will use member feedback in learner surveys, site feedback email, and bulletin board posts to enhance marketing material. We do not disclose any personal information about the individuals and we refer to them anonymously. (i.e."...," commented a learner who has just completed a beginning computer course.)

When using this tool, we recommend that you do not post personal information about yourself or others. We also ask that you do not intentionally post information about a person that is false, harmful, obscene, that violates a person's right to privacy, that otherwise violates any applicable local, state, national or international law, or that is otherwise inappropriate. In the case that information of this nature is posted, GCF Global Learning® has the right to remove it from the bulletin boards. By participating in bulletin board discussions, you are consenting with these terms.
