# Privacy Policy · GiveCampus

We will use the personal information you provide for a variety of purposes, including to:

#### 5\. How We Don't Use Your Information

We take securing your data and preserving your privacy very seriously. As such, the following information about you will never be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:

  


  1. your credit card details or other payment information;
  

  2. your password details;
  

  3. your IP address; or
  

  4. communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem).



Additionally, we will never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission.

  


#### 6\. Accessing or Changing Your PII

You can modify, delete, or correct inaccuracies in your PII by logging into your account and updating your profile. We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes. On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information about you that we hold. This information is subject to a fee not exceeding the prescribed fee permitted by law.

  


#### 7\. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

In general, we don’t give your personal information to any third-party services unless it’s necessary to provide our Service (like when you make a charitable gift to a school or when we partner with payment processors to facilitate such a gift). We may give, share, sell or trade your PII to or with any third parties as follows:

  


#### 7.1. Campaign creators

When you support a campaign, the creator will be notified that you did so, unless you choose not to have your name displayed on the campaign page. The creator will not receive the details/amount of your pledge/donation, your email address, or your credit card details or other payment information. The fact that you support a campaign—whether by making a donation or through some form of Advocacy—will be displayed on your profile page, if you have one, unless you request that your name not be publicly displayed on the campaign page.

  


#### 7.2. Educational Institutions

When you make a donation to or otherwise support a school on GiveCampus, we share certain information about you with that school. This information may include your name, address, ZIP code, email address, donation amount, and date of transaction, the name of the campaign or other purpose associated with the donation, and any other data that you provide when making your donation or carrying out another form of support on GiveCampus. If you wish to stop receiving communications from the school, please contact the school directly.

  


#### 7.3. Service Providers

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, companies and individuals who: (i) process donations; (ii) conduct surveys or promotional activities; (ii) deliver products; or (iv) provide customer support, web hosting, internet service, and data analysis. Such third parties may be provided with access to PII needed to perform their functions but may not use such information for any other purpose.

When you upload a video to GiveCampus, either for a campaign or as part of a Personal Plea for a campaign, we partner with Vimeo to host that video so that others can view it. Thus, if you upload a video to GiveCampus, you also agree to Vimeo’s terms and their privacy policies with respect to that video and the information associated with it.

  


#### 7.4. Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection

We may disclose any information, including, without limitation, PII, that we deem necessary, in our sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including, without limitation, PII, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction and related activities or to protect the rights, property of safety of GiveCampus, its agents, employees or affiliates or others. GiveCampus reserves the right to disclose PII for a user who we believe is in violation of our Privacy Policy or other terms of service as posted on the Site, even without a subpoena, warrant, court order or other governmental request.

  


#### 7.5. Sale or Transfer of Information

In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of GiveCampus or the Site, PII and/or other information collected about you from the Site may be sold, assigned or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of GiveCampus or the Site in order to permit the party to continue the operation of GiveCampus and/or the Site or any successor version of the Site. By using the Site and providing PII to GiveCampus, you consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described in this paragraph.

  


#### 8\. Credit Card Information

GiveCampus does not collect, store or otherwise maintain any credit card information from individuals who make a donation through the Site. Donations, including information associated with your credit card, are processed by our dedicated payments partners (e.g. WePay), by a school, or by a dedicated payments partner of a school. All information associated with your use of WePay or one of these other entities will be handled in accordance with that entity’s terms. For example, when you donate through GiveCampus and use WePay to process your donation, your credit card information will be handled in accordance with WePay’s terms and privacy policies.

  


#### 9\. Information You Publicly Post

Any PII you post publicly on the Site (“Publicly Available Content”) is available to the public without any expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Publicly Available Content even if you remove the Publicly Available Content. To request removal of your personal information from these areas of the site, contact us using the information below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. The profile you create on our site will be publicly visible.

  


#### 9.1. Your profile

When you create an account, your profile page will display your name, any education history you provide (or that we access, with your permission, from other sources), your picture (if you upload one to GiveCampus or if you give us permission to access your profile picture from other sources), and a list of the campaigns you have supported or created (but not any specifics about donation amounts), as well as the way(s) in which you supported them (e.g., by making a donation) and any information you choose to add to your profile. Whenever your account name appears on the site, people can click your account name to see your profile.

  


#### 9.2. Facebook and Other Social Networking Sites

The Site allow users to access Facebook and Twitter to interact with friends and to share on Facebook and Twitter. Users may also register for GiveCampus using their Facebook account. If you do this, we may receive information from Facebook to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and to enable us to show you relevant content from your Facebook friends. Any information that we collect from your Facebook account may depend on the privacy settings you have with Facebook, so please consult Facebook’s privacy and data practices.

  


#### 10\. Important Disclosures, Practices and Contact Information

#### 10.1. Third-party Links

GiveCampus may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that GiveCampus cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of GiveCampus. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of these web sites before providing any information to them.

  


#### 10.2. Data Security

We maintain a variety of safeguards designed to protect your PII from unauthorized access and disclosure. You should be aware, however, that GiveCampus has no control over the security of other websites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those websites from our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your PII.

We want you to feel confident using the Site. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your PII, searches or other communications always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the email address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your PII.

  


#### 10.3. Children

GiveCampus is not intended for persons under the age of 13. GiveCampus does not knowingly market to, or solicit information, accept service or collect information from any person under the age of 13. If GiveCampus becomes aware that any person submitting information to the Site is under the age of 13, we will attempt to delete the account and any related information as soon as possible. We require that only persons 13 years of age or older use the Site. By using the Site, you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old.

People under 18 (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) are not permitted to use GiveCampus on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of the site.

  


#### 10.4. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we only will notify you by sending an email to the email address(s) you provided to us, and by posting notice of the changes on the Site. We will give you an opportunity to opt-out of any materially changed Privacy Policy or alternatively, delete the information you have provided to us. We recommend that you check the Site from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.

  


#### 10.5. Users From Outside the United States

The Site is hosted in the United States and is governed by United States law. If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

  


#### 10.6. No Rights of Third Parties

This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties.

  


#### 10.7. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, California law permits you to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their “direct marketing purposes” as such term is defined by California’s Shine the Light Law (California Civil Code 1798.83). To make such a request, please email us at [info@givecampus.com](mailto:info@givecampus.com). We will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the email address specified above. You should put “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line and in your request. You must provide GiveCampus with specific information regarding yourself so GiveCampus can accurately respond to the request.
