# Privacy - If you have something to give, you have a lot to gain!

"We are immune to advertising. Just forget it."  \- The Cluetrain Manifesto

## Privacy Policy

We ("[GivenGain](https://web.archive.org/about/)") operate several websites including givengain.com and givengain.org. It is GivenGain's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. 

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, GivenGain collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GivenGain's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GivenGain's visitors use its website. From time to time, GivenGain may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

GivenGain also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. GivenGain does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to GivenGain's websites choose to interact with GivenGain in ways that require GivenGain to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that GivenGain gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our services to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with GivenGain are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, GivenGain collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with GivenGain. GivenGain does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

When you make a donation to a cause on GivenGain, whether directly on the cause page or on a fundraising page, GivenGain collects a variety of personal information about you in order to properly process your donation. This personal information may include your name, address, phone, email address, the message you have written to the cause or fundraiser, and the donation amount. GivenGain shares this information with the cause(s) to whom you have designated your donation. This way the cause can enter you into their database of supporters. We encourage these causes not to share your personal information without your knowledge or permission; however, this information is subject to their policies and practices and is not controlled by GivenGain. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a particular organization before making a donation.

### Aggregated Statistics

GivenGain may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, GivenGain may monitor the most popular service accounts on the GivenGain site. GivenGain may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, GivenGain does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

GivenGain discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on GivenGain's behalf or to provide services available at GivenGain's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using GivenGain's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. GivenGain will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, GivenGain discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when GivenGain believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of GivenGain, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an GivenGain website and have supplied your email address, GivenGain may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with GivenGain and our services. We primarily use GivenGain.com to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. GivenGain takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. GivenGain uses cookies to help GivenGain identify and track visitors, their usage of the GivenGain website, and their website access preferences. GivenGain visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using GivenGain's websites, with the drawback that certain features of GivenGain's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GivenGain and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, GivenGain may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GivenGain's sole discretion. GivenGain encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a GivenGain account, you should also check your account dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
