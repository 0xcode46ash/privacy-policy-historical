This website is owned by GiveSmart UK Limited and operated by its affiliate GiveSmart US, Inc. (“ **GiveSmart** ;” collectively, “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ”).

This Notice applies to the websites where this Notice is posted as well as to any other versions of the GiveSmart website that GiveSmart operates (collectively, the “ **Websites** ”).

For clarification, this Notice applies only to information collected through the Websites and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any of GiveSmart’s affiliates or other third parties.

In addition, you may provide us with Personal information by participating in online surveys, subscribing to newsletters and other recurring offerings through the Websites, and in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Websites. If you provide Personal Information to us regarding others, we rely on you to obtain that other person’s consent for disclosing their information to us and inform that other person about how we will use the information and our contact details for any queries.
