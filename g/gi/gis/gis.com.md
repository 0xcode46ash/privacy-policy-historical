# Privacy Policy

ESRI respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This privacy statement outlines the information ESRI collects via GIS.com and how we use that information. This statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit this Web site.

Personally Identifiable Information

ESRI collects personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address only if you provide that information to us voluntarily.

The voluntary information we collect is used for internal review and to notify visitors about updates to our Web site. We will contact you only if you request that we do. We will not share your information with third parties.

Otherwise, ESRI generally will not disclose your personally identifiable information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law, and (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ESRI.

Information Collected Automatically

We collect your domain name (such as gis.com), the type of Internet browser you use, and the operating system you use automatically. This information is used only for internal review to help us improve the content of our Web page. The information is not shared with any other company or used by ESRI to contact visitors.

Children

ESRI does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address from children. However, users of any age can use or contribute to the search utilities available on the site. Contributing requires a name and e-mail address.

If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information and the parent or guardian of that child would like that information deleted from our records, the parent or guardian should contact us at [giswebmaster@gis.com](mailto:giswebmaster@gis.com). We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files.

Information We May Place Automatically on Your Computer's Hard Drive

At the moment we do not use cookies on GIS.com, but we may in the future. "Cookies" are used to store information you provide to prevent you from having to enter that same information repeatedly and to help us collect minimal information to maintain and improve our site.

Cookies cannot be used to collect personal information about you, to collect information from your files, or to do damage to your files. A cookie is a single line of code with very limited functions. For more information about cookies, we recommend visiting <http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml>.

With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
