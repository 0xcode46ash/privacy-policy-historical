**What personally identifiable information is collected from me?**

GIST Communications, which operates the Internet site located at www.gist.com, recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our site. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address, is automatically collected from visitors to our site. Personally identifiable information about visitors to our sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, GIST will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information about you. For example, we may need to collect such information to fulfill your registration, in connection with contest entry forms, or in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards.

**How is my information used?**

Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to the GIST site is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may include sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting or sharing the information with GIST's advertisers and business partners, who use the information for marketing and promotional purposes. However, at the time of collection, you will have the option of instructing us not to send you additional information or share your personal information with third parties. GIST is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our advertisers or business partners. GIST may also use third parties to manage sweepstakes, contests or chats, and these parties may have access to personally identifiable information submitted by visitors who participate in those activities. GIST instructs these third parties to use personally identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information to other entities. GIST may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to make our site better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. This statistical compilation of non-identifiable information may also be used by GIST or provided to others for marketing, advertising or research purposes. Visitors to our sites will be able to instruct us not to include their personal information in our aggregate database by e-mail request or by modifying online registrations. GIST maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and periodically reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies.

**What are cookies and how are they used by GIST?**

Cookies are data that a web site transfers to an individual's hard-drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most web sites, including those operated by GIST, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They aid the function of this web site by matching users with stored information in our database to provide personalized TV listings. The Cookie itself does not contain any personally identifiable information. If a user does not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But users should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide the user with such special features as customized content delivery.

**What do I need to know about linking to Third Party and Co-Branded sites?**

GIST has established relationships that allow visitors to our Internet site to link directly to sites operated by third parties. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with a GIST logo; however, they are not operated or maintained by GIST. GIST chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, GIST is not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by GIST of the content, policies or practices of such third party sites. Once you have left the GIST site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. This site may also be linked to websites operated by companies affiliated with GIST. Visitors to those sites should refer to their separate privacy policies and practices.
