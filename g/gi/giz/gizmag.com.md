Below is the current policy regarding the usage of data collected by the Gizmag web site (hereafter referred to as "Gizmag"). We re-evaluate this policy on an ongoing basis and if we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes here on this page as soon as they go into effect. 

Gizmag collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. 

Gizmag may place a cookie in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable Gizmag to manage the banner advertisements presented to the user. 

We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of Web sites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. 

Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. 

Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers 

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). 

Currently, we have a relationship with the following third-party ad network (click to visit their Web site): [ 24/7 Real Media, Inc.](http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html)

Individual information on our customers will NEVER be provided to external parties. The aggregated information we collect is used for the following purposes: 

  * to improve the content and design of the Gizmag web site and magazine,
  * to verify our claims of traffic to the site,
and to help advertisers and potential advertisers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns. 


All e-mail mailing lists maintained by Gizmag contain the names of people who have specifically and knowingly requested to receive information from us. Currently, e-mail addresses may be used by Gizmag to promote our products and for editorial consultations with users. We allow users to opt out of receiving e-mail from Gizmag.com when e-mail information is collected. 

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, you can contact the editor at [editor@gizmag.com](mailto:editor@gizmag.com).
