Gemological Institute of America, Inc. (“GIA”) respects your privacy. GIA provides this website privacy policy to inform you of our privacy practices with respect to the collection and use of information that we collect about you, including any information that might personally identify you (e.g., your name, email address, home / mailing address, phone number, purchase history and credit card information),through our website, www.gia.edu (this “Site”). By using this Site and our products and services available through this Site and our mobile applications (“Applications”), you agree that your information, including your personal information, will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into our [Terms of Service](http://www.gia.edu/terms-of-use). Should you not agree with or accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use this Site or our Applications

###  SCOPE

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you visit our Site and use our products and services as well as download and use our mobile applications (collectively, our “Services”). Additional policies also may apply to your information; for example, student information also is governed by the GIA Educational Privacy Policy and kept in accordance with the provisions of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The policy is available for review by [contacting GIA Education Records](mailto:records@gia.edu). For more information, see “Academic Records” in the Academic Policies and Procedures section on page 67 of the [Education Catalog](https://web.archive.org/cs/Satellite?blobcol=gfile&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&blobheadername2=MDT-Type&blobheadername3=Content-Type&blobheadervalue1=attachment%3B+filename%3DGIA-2017-Education-Catalog-US-0417.pdf&blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobheadervalue3=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=GIA_DocumentFile&blobwhere=1356020092190&ssbinary=true). In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the FERPA policy (or other educational policy that we may provide to you from time to time), that policy, not this one, will govern.

###  INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

_Information We Collect Directly From You:_ We collect information, including personal information, directly from you when you create an account with us, sign up for our online classes, request information from us, purchase products from us, and otherwise interact with our Site and our Services. The type of information that we collect from you varies based on your particular interaction with our Site, but may include: your name, email address, home / mailing address, telephone number, and, where applicable, payment information, and information relevant to your educational history, among other information. Please note that your educational account may not be used for certain purchases/other purposes on our Site, and you may be requested to create a secondary account.

_Third Parties_. On our Site, you may email a friend about Services that you believe would be of interest. We will collect your name, email address, as well as your friend’s name and email address. We use the information collected from you to complete your request, but we will not use that information for future marketing efforts.

_Information We Collect Automatically:_

  * _Through our Site:_ We may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information about you, including your IP address, browser type, visitor domain name, referring URL (previous page visited), subsequent pages, and whether you are a first time visitor.

  * _Through our Mobile Applications:_
    * GIA 4Cs Guide for iPhone and iPad (English and Simplified Chinese): To provide the highest quality experience, GIA collects anonymous information about usage of our mobile applications. If you prefer not to participate in Flurry Analytics, our analytics data collection service, please follow the instructions provided at www.flurry.com to opt-out.
    * Gems & Gemology for iPad: GIA uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous information about the use of the Gems & Gemology iPad application (app). This tool helps us to identify any recurring technical issues and to provide the most user-friendly experience to our readers. The only method for preventing Google Analytics from capturing your usage is to disable the internet connection on your device while reading the content. This method may, however, adversely affect the performance of the app and prevent it from functioning as expected.

###  COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES

Web cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar technologies are used to track user activity and collect Site and mobile application data. We may combine this data with the personal information we have collected from you.

**Your Consent.** By continuing to use our Site, you are agreeing to our placing cookies on your computer or electronic portable device in order to analyse the way you use our Site. Please read this cookie section carefully for more details about the information we collect when you use this Site.

**Cookies.** Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for record keeping and other purposes. We and our third party service providers use “cookies” on our Site and similar devices designed for mobile applications, to, among other things, better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies.

This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.

Visitors to our Site who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, many site features, such as the shopping cart will not function if you disable cookies.

**Local Storage Objects.** We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences and to support individual applications. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.

To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose [“Website Storage Settings Panel”](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

**Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.** Our third party service providers use web beacons in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

**Site Analytics.** We work with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site and our mobile application. For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, to help us improve our Site and mobile application’s performance and user experiences.

**Additional Notice to EU Visitors. Withdrawing your consent.** Once you have given us your consent to the use of cookies, we shall store a cookie on your computer or device to remember this for next time. This will expire periodically. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you will need to delete your cookies using your internet browser settings.
