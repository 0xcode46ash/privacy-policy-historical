Through our website, located at http://www.gia.edu (this “Site”), we collect, store and use your Personal Information only for stated purposes, such as to support your needs and enhance our relationship with you. We do not sell your Personal Information. We may share it with other organizations, but only after you have given your consent. At any time, you may contact GIA with any of your privacy questions or concerns. You may also ask at any time to see, correct, or delete the Personal Information you have given us.

###  PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY

At GIA, privacy and data security are important to us. That is why when you visit our Site, we attempt to help you maintain control over your Personal Information.

We will ask you to provide Personal Information that will enable us to enhance your Site visit, to assist you with a purchase, to provide you with requested products and services, to provide technical support, or to follow up with you after your Site visit. Your participation is completely optional.

###  GIA ONLY USES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES

GIA uses your Personal Information to provide you with requested products and services, to enhance your experience using the GIA Site, to provide you with information that we believe would be of interest to you, to solicit donations, and to further your relationship with GIA. Employees of GIA who have access to your Personal Information are required to keep the Personal Information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than those permitted by this Privacy Policy. GIA may enhance or merge your Personal Information with data from third parties for purposes of marketing GIA’s products or services to you.

We may periodically send you electronic communications about GIA’s various products, services, newsletters or general updates. You may opt-out of some or all of these communications by using “unsubscribe” options or by sending a request to [privacy@gia.edu](mailto:privacy@gia.edu).

###  MOBILE APPLICATIONS

_GIA 4Cs Guide for iPhone and iPad (English and Simplified Chinese)_  
In order to provide the highest quality experience, GIA collects anonymous information about usage of our mobile applications. If you prefer not to participate in Flurry Analytics, our analytics data collection service, please follow the instructions provided at www.flurry.com to [opt-out](http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html).

_Gems & Gemology for iPad_  
GIA uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous information about the use of the Gems & Gemology iPad application (app). This tool helps us to identify any recurring technical issues and to provide the most user-friendly experience to our readers. The only method for preventing Google Analytics from capturing your usage is to disable the internet connection on your device while reading the content. This method may, however, adversely affect the performance of the app and prevent it from functioning as expected.

###  GIA WILL NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION FOR ITS USE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT

Your Personal Information will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its use or solicitation without your consent. We may share your Personal Information with agents or contractors of GIA for the sole purpose of performing services for you through GIA. In addition, GIA may be required to disclose Personal Information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, other legal action, or if GIA reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect GIA, its customers, alumni, employees or the public.

###  INTERNET COMMERCE

Your online transactions with GIA are designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information and any other Personal Information you provide. GIA is committed to data security with respect to Personal Information collected on our Site. If you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a GIA representative over the telephone.

###  LINKS

For your convenience, GIA may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals to certain third parties’ products or services. If you choose to visit a third party’s website or use its products or services, please be aware that the third party’s privacy policy, and not the GIA privacy policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party.

###  COOKIES

To facilitate your use of the Site, GIA uses “cookies.” A cookie is a small amount of data that GIA’s servers transfer to your browser and that only GIA’s servers can read. When you log onto our Site, the cookie file captures your username, unique session identifier number and other session data to enable you to traverse through the Site’s various screens without having to authenticate yourself at each new screen.

Additionally, some GIA Websites and Applications may use the Demographics and Interest reporting feature for Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The data provided by this service (such as age, gender, and interests) is used to better understand visitors to these Websites and may be used to customize our advertising and content to match our users’ interest. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by visiting [Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) or by visiting the Google Analytics' [currently available opt-outs](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) for the web

###  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY (AGE 12 AND UNDER)

GIA takes privacy seriously, including the privacy of children and consequently insists that all Site users are 13 years old or older.

GIA does not seek to collect Personal Information about children through our Site.

If we become aware that a person submitting Personal Information to us through any part of the Site is a child, we delete such Personal Information as soon as reasonably practical after we discover it and do not, after such discovery, use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties.

Since we do not seek to collect any Personal Information about children, and we delete any such Personal Information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of Personal Information about their child before we have discovered and deleted such information, then we will, of course, honor that request.
