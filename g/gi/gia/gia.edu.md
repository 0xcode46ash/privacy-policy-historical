The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides students with certain rights with respect to their education records. All student records are kept in accordance with the provisions of FERPA. Education records include all files, records and documents that contain information directly related to a student’s academic and financial records, placement files and financial aid documents. Transcript information is retained permanently, and other signed documents and specific records are retained according to applicable state and federal regulations.

GIA will not release any student-specific financial aid information to a third party without the student’s permission.

This request remains in place until rescinded in writing by the student.  
GIA may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties, including parents of an eligible student, in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.

Students may examine their own records by submitting a written request to the manager of education records, who will schedule an appointment with them to view their education records within 45 days of receiving the request.

Students who believe their records are inaccurate, misleading, or violate their privacy may submit a written request to the manager of education records that their record be amended. If the record is not amended, the student may request a hearing to challenge the contents of the record. The student will be informed, in writing, of the decision resulting from the hearing. If the record is not amended as a result of the hearing, the student has the right to place a statement in his or her record commenting on the contested information in the record or stating why he or she disagrees with the decision of the hearing. The student may also submit a written complaint to the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-4605 USA.
