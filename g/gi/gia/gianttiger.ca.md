# Privacy | Giant Tiger

### **Effective November 2012**

Giant Tiger Stores Limited is committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information. This includes all personal information acquired through our contests and/or promotions or through interactions with our Internet sites. 

This privacy policy will outline how we collect, use and retain your personal information.

### Your Consent To This Policy

By accessing this website and/or participating in one of our contests/promotions, you (as well as your parent or legal guardian, if applicable) acknowledge and accept these terms and conditions of use.

### Personal Information

Personal information may include your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. You may happen to provide us with such information through resources such as regular mail, our on-line application form or via our email addresses. In all cases, we will take steps to ensure that the information is handled securely. These steps are taken in order to comply with legislative requirements, such as those contained in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act.

### Collecting, Using and Protecting your Information

Information is only collected with your consent, and will be used for the sole purpose that is stipulated at the time the information is gathered. Your consent is deemed to be given when you send information to us through the internet. Giant Tiger does not sell or share customer information with any other organization or person for any reason. 

The information sent to Giant Tiger is kept confidential and secure. We make every reasonable effort to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security policies are reviewed and enhanced as necessary.

Only authorized employees and providers have access to your personal information. Where information is processed by a third party provider, we make sure, through our contracts with them, that all your information is kept secure. Information is only kept for the duration we are providing you with a product or service, and for a reasonable time thereafter in the event that you wish to resume service. 

### Accuracy of Personal Information

For the most part, we collect personal information that is directly supplied by you. We will therefore assume the information you have provided us with is accurate. We will not make additional efforts to verify its accuracy or to update the information unless requested by you. Customers and/or applicants may request in writing access to their personal information; to do so please write to the address indicated below. Any information we have on record will be provided to you. You may at that time put in a request for your information to be updated to ensure its accuracy.

### Non-Personal Information Collected Automatically

We do not require your personal information in order for you to access this website. We may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable such as the type of internet browser or computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site. In addition, when you view our websites, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies allow us to tailor a website or promotion to better match your interests and preferences. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
