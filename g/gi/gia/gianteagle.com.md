These cards are subject to their own privacy policies which are referenced in the separate Cardholder Agreement. 
      5. If your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® is owned jointly with another person, we will not disclose your shopping history to the other person unless they are also registered on the website and you have consented. 
      6. If you pay with check, credit or debit card, Giant Eagle, like most retailers, compares your account number against one or more third party databases to check for problems. To the extent permitted by law, Giant Eagle may keep a record of check or credit problems and may share those account numbers with third parties who share their information with Giant Eagle. 
    2. _Aggregated Information._ Giant Eagle also collects, stores and uses aggregate sales and customer data. This information may be acquired through the Giant Eagle Advantage Card® database, from users of this website, or from other sources such as contests, promotions or community events. It may be shared with or sold to third parties for any purpose. This information is in summary form and is not personally identifiable to you. 
    3. _To Improve Our Service._ Giant Eagle may share or use Information within its own divisions and affiliates, including but not limited to GetGo from Giant Eagle, Giant Eagle Express, Giant Eagle Market District and independent Giant Eagle retailers. When you register on the website, you can choose the kind of information you want to receive from Gianteagle.com by email.

  3. **Is the Information Secure?**

Giant Eagle understands that using the Internet may cause concerns. This is why we take special steps to protect your privacy. The Information we acquire from you is encrypted while it is in transit from your computer to ours. At Giant Eagle, your Information is stored on our secure server, and we have security procedures in place to permit access by only a limited number of authorized employees and service providers for limited purposes. Anyone attempting to get access from outside the organization, including you, must have a user name and password. We employ “firewalls”, Intrusion Prevention Systems and other security devices on our servers to prevent unauthorized computer access from outside. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect Information, we cannot insure or warrant confidentiality of Information.

Giant Eagle may use the Information offered for posting as information that is free and available to the general public and accepts no duty of privacy as to its content. 
    3. _Promotions, Contests, Advertisers._ We reserve the right to acquire or retain Information you may give to the sponsors of promotions and contests entered on this site.
