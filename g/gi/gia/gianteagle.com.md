# Giant Eagle® Privacy Policy - About - Giant Eagle

Your privacy is important to Giant Eagle® and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we may acquire about you, our customer, through our websites at [www.gianteagle.com](http://www.gianteagle.com/) and elsewhere, and/or our mobile platforms and other sources, the GIANT EAGLE®, MARKET DISTRICT®, GETGO® properties and their online presences (collectively, our “Sites”), and how we may use that information. When you use your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® or give us information via any of our Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We may revise this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the end of the policy. This Privacy Policy also applies to any of our other websites and/or apps that post and/or link to this Privacy Policy. It does not apply to third party websites and/or apps that post different statements addressing users’ privacy.

Our Sites are controlled by Giant Eagle in the United States and are subject to its laws.

  * **What Kind of Information is Collected About You?**
    * _The Giant Eagle Advantage Card ®._ In order to provide you with the benefits of the Giant Eagle Advantage Card® program (including the accrual and use of **_fuelperks! ®_**, where available), Giant Eagle must obtain certain information including your name and address, your record of purchases, and other information that you may elect to give. You voluntarily provided some of this information when you applied for your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® and the Information is supplemented each time you use the Card. Giant Eagle collects and retains this information whether or not you register on or use any of our Sites. You may elect to register your Card on certain of our Sites which will make this information accessible to you through our Sites. 

Personally identifiable information means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name (first and last), address (city, state, zip), email address, telephone number, etc. Your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® number is not personally identifiable information unless it is accompanied by your name, address, social security number or password. 

    * _Information You Provide._ We collect information you provide at various times: 
      * Registration Information. In order to obtain certain services on any of our Sites, you must register with the site or app and provide information that personally identifies you or permits us to contact you. This includes your name, address and certain preferences. You may also provide information when you register for a contest or purchase products from our Website or through links accessed through our Sites. You may browse our Sites without registering; in that case, your visit will remain anonymous unless you otherwise provide personal information during your visit. If you choose not to register or provide information, you can still view most of our Sites, with the exception of those areas that require registration. Note, however, that especially with our apps, the features of the Sites available to an unregistered user may be significantly limited. 
      * Communications, Support Requests. If you contact us for assistance or to report a problem, or other issue through and/or regarding any of our Sites, we may collect and store your contact information, communication, and/or other information about you, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, user name, location, and other information, and we reserve the right to conduct further research and obtain further information as necessary. We will use the information to respond to you, research your request/communication, and for other purposes in accordance with provisions of this Privacy Policy. 
      * Shared Content. Some of our Sites and services may now or in the future allow you to interact with other users and/or post, share, communicate with, or otherwise transmit content publicly, such as by posting comments and other information (collectively “Shared Content”). We may collect and store archives of such Shared Content on our servers, and all Shared Content is subject to this Privacy Policy and may be used or disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, including but not limited to protecting the safety and well being of members of the public, minors, our users, our team members, and our Sites and services. Keep in mind that your Shared Content could be visible to anyone who has access to our Sites. Your user name as well as other profile information may be displayed in conjunction with your Shared Content. Thus, those accessing this information may be able to identify you. Giant Eagle may use the information offered for posting as information that is free and available to the general public and accepts no duty of privacy as to its content. 
    * _Information from Other Contacts._ We may collect information about you in other ways not specified here. For example, we may collect information from a direct contact with a team member in our stores or through any source available to the public. 
    * _Social Media Widgets._ Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. 
    * _Location Information._ In order to provide you with certain services, we may collect information about where you are physically located. Such information may be used to, among other things, provide you with offers and information relevant to our stores. 
    * _Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ When you visit and interact with any of our Sites, Giant Eagle and third parties who provide services to Giant Eagle collect general information that does not specifically identify you. This includes server log files, environmental variables and pixel tags. Collecting this kind of information is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We and our service providers may also use “cookies” on the Site. A cookie is a piece of data that a web server stores on your hard drive. Cookies are standard in Internet use and help you to navigate in a website that you have visited before; they do not harm your computer. They allow us to see information on user website activities such as source, page views, and time spent on the site. This information is displayed as numbers; it cannot be traced back to individuals. We may use third party vendors whose websites will use these cookies in order to provide you with targeted ads that match your interests. For example, if you visit those vendor websites, you may see ads for Giant Eagle or for products you saw on our Sites. If you do not want cookies placed on your computer, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline them (for example, at Google, follow [www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads)). You can also decline some of them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page: [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). If you decline cookies, you may not be able to use some features of our Sites. 
  * **What Does Giant Eagle Do With Information?**
    * _Sharing Information with Third Parties_
      * Giant Eagle may disclose information to service providers and nonaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances: 
        * In order to provide you with services or information that you request or benefits for which you are eligible as a Giant Eagle customer; 
        * To complete a transaction you have authorized; 
        * If required to do so by law; in response to a specific law enforcement request; to comply with legal process; if necessary to protect the rights, privacy, property, security or safety of Giant Eagle, our team members or customers; to assist in the detection, prevention or prosecution of a crime or fraud; or in cases of emergency regarding matters of personal or public safety; and 
        * In order to enforce our rights in contracts or transactions that you participate in with us. 
      * We may transfer information to an affiliated entity or to a third party in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Giant Eagle’s business, assets or stock. We may disclose information to a prospective buyer or business partner pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreement. 
      * We may make information available to third parties who analyze and collect information for Giant Eagle so that we can offer you goods, services and opportunities. The third parties may not use the information for their own benefit or for any other purpose. 
      * Giant Eagle may share your name and address with financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product such as the Giant Eagle private label credit card. These cards are subject to their own privacy policies referenced in the separate Cardholder Agreement. 
      * If your Giant Eagle Advantage Card® is owned jointly with another person, we will not disclose your shopping history to the other person unless they are also registered on the website and you have consented. 
      * If you pay with check, credit or debit card, Giant Eagle, like most retailers, compares your account number against one or more third party databases to check for problems. To the extent permitted by law, Giant Eagle may keep a record of check or credit problems and may share those account numbers with third parties who share their information with Giant Eagle. 
    * _Aggregated Information._ Giant Eagle also collects, stores and uses aggregate sales and customer data. This information may be acquired through the Giant Eagle Advantage Card® database, from users of any of our Sites, or from other sources such as contests, promotions or community events. It may be shared with or sold to third parties for any purpose. This information is in summary form and is not personally identifiable to you. 
    * _To Improve Our Service._ Giant Eagle may share or use information within its own divisions and affiliates, including but not limited to GetGo from Giant Eagle, Giant Eagle Market District and independent Giant Eagle retailers. 
  * **Information Choices and Changes.** When you register on our Sites, you can choose the kind of information you want to receive by email. If you do not wish to receive email communications, simply choose the “opt-out” option when you register or use the opt-out reply to any emails you receive. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. You may send requests about personal information to our Contact information below. You can request to change contact choices and update your personal information. 
  * **What about “Do Not Track”?** Because consumers are often unaware that their do-not-track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of our users. Accordingly, we do not respond to the federal Do-Not-Track signal. If you would like to receive no promotional communications, you are free to follow the procedures in this Privacy Policy, on our Sites, and/or in such communications to unsubscribe. 
  * **Is the Information Secure?** Giant Eagle understands that using the Internet and mobile applications may cause concerns. This is why we take special steps to protect your privacy. The information we acquire from you is encrypted while it is in transit from your computer to ours. At Giant Eagle, your information is stored on our secure server, and we have security procedures in place to permit access by only a limited number of authorized employees and service providers for limited purposes. Anyone attempting to get access from outside the organization, including you, must have a user name and password. We employ “firewalls”, Intrusion Prevention Systems and other security devices on our servers to prevent unauthorized computer access from outside. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect information, we cannot insure or warrant confidentiality of information. 
  * **Information You May Provide to Others From Our Site.**
    * _Links to Other Sites._ Our site may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our site. Giant Eagle is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites. Giant Eagle neither controls nor supervises the privacy practices of any other link or advertiser on our Website. 
    * _Information Sent at your Request._ Some parts of the Website may permit you to e-mail or forward content or information to others. If you utilize this service, we may retain and use the e-mail address and other information about the transfer as described in this policy. 
  * **Access by Children?** Our Sites are not directed towards children under 13 years of age and we request that children under 13 do not provide information about themselves. 
  * **Contact Us.** We welcome your comments or questions about this Policy. You may contact us through any of our Sites that include [“Contact Us”](http://www.gianteagle.com/Contact-Us/) feature, through our Customer Service phone number, and/or by mail at our address for any reason.
