# Privacy | Giant Magazine — The Ultimate Entertainment Magazine

At GIANTmag.com we respect your right to privacy.

For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of GIANTmag.com, download free information, enter contests or request information.

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide on GIANTmag.com are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide GIANT Magazine with your name (or alias), e–mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not ‘opt out,’ GIANT Magazine and GIANT Magazine representatives may use the provided information to alert you to special offers, updated information, new services, and other GIANT Magazine information. Beyond its representatives, GIANT Magazine does not offer or allow the selling of any user–provided information to third parties.

GIANT Magazine respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e–mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long–term ability to continue to communicate with our users. If you do not want GIANT Magazine or GIANT Magazine representatives to contact you, you may ‘opt out’ of this preference at any time, whether you’re online or contacting GIANT Magazine directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you’ll always have the option to opt back in and have GIANT Magazine contact you based on your previous or new preferences.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most areas of the GIANT Magazine website; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.

If a user elects to use our Tell A Friend application for forwarding a GIANT Magazine e–mail to their friend or informing a freind about our website, we ask them for the friend’s name and e–mail address. GIANT Magazine will automatically send the friend the specified e–mail or the specified website information. GIANT Magazine will not use the friend’s information to contact them in the future.
