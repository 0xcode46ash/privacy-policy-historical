## Privacy Statement for girlvanic.com

Girlvanic Studios has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

As is true with most websites, our server will automatically log data regarding each visit such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We may use this information to monitor server errors, server administration or to monitor visitor behaviour. It is not possible for this to be disabled on a per-user basis so you must leave this website if you do not agree to this happening.

No personal information is collected when you simply visit or use the website so no information of this kind is shared with any third parties or used for any purposes.

If legally required to do so, we will disclose to a third party any information we have.
