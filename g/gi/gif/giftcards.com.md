# Privacy Policy – GiftCards.com

Omni Prepaid, LLC and its affiliated companies GiftCards.com, LLC, WRL.com, LLC MyCoupons, LLC, and Giftcodes.com, LLC own and operate Giftcards.com, WRL.com, MyCoupons.com, GiftCodes.com and Omnicard.com. We value each and every customer relationship. To protect and maintain these relationships, we have adopted a privacy policy to maintain the confidentiality of the nonpublic personal information you have shared with us. We recognize your expectations for the responsible use and protection of your information and your right to privacy. We maintain information about you in order to provide you with the most effective and convenient access to our broad range of financial products and services.

Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing of their nonpublic personal information. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. To this end, we will maintain standards to reasonably ensure that your information is private and secure at all times. We want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and protect it.

**We will not share your confidential information with any company or third party except as required or permitted by law.**

The basis of each of our customer relationships is built on trust. You have chosen to do business with us, and we guard that relationship with great care, beginning with the information you have chosen to share with us. Omni will not share nonpublic personal information about you with any company or third party except as required or permitted by law. This means, for example, that we can disclose your confidential information:

  * • To third parties that help us provide products or services to you;
  * • To third parties that assist us in marketing accounts and services to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements to enhance our financial product or service offerings;
  * • To consumer reporting agencies;
  * • To third parties that process or service a financial product, service or transaction that you requested or authorized;
  * • To respond to a subpoena, court order or judicial process; to pursue a sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or operating unit;
  * • To our regulators and auditors;
  * • To protect against or prevent fraud, manage risk, or resolve customer disputes;
  * • To a third party to whom you specifically authorize us to share the information.



Whenever other companies or third parties provide services for us or on our behalf, we require them by contract to maintain the appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and the confidentiality of the information that we provide them. Because certain disclosures of confidential information are specifically required or permitted by law, we can make these disclosures even if you prefer we do not do so. Therefore, you do not have to respond to this notice in any way.

**How we use, collect, and retain information about you.**

Your relationship is important to us and we're committed to providing you with the best service possible. To do that, we gather information from a variety of sources to keep you informed about the many financial services, products, and benefits available to you as our customer. For example, we collect information from the following sources:

  1. From you whether in writing on applications, by telephone, electronically or by any other means. This information may include your name, address, and social security number;
  2. Transactions with others or us. This information may include your account balances, payment history and account usage;
  3. Consumer reporting agencies. This information may include account information and information about your creditworthiness and credit history; and,
  4. Public sources. This information may include real estate records and telephone numbers.




The confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information will continue to be maintained consistent with this privacy notice even if you decide to close your account(s), your account becomes inactive, or when you otherwise cease to do business with us. 

**We will maintain a security program to protect your information.**

We have been certified by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) as a Level 1 service provider and merchant. We are committed to the security of your financial and personal information. We safeguard information according to established security standards and procedures, and we continually assess new technology for protecting information.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal information.

There are many benefits to sharing information within our family of companies. These are just a few:

  * • _Fraud Prevention_ \- Sharing information amongst our affiliated companies helps us to prevent fraud.

For example, our call centers are able to serve you faster and more efficiently when they have access to all of your bank relationships and account information.

  * • _Tailored Products and Services_ \- Knowledge of your account relationships, balances and transaction behavior helps us to identify what products and services may be most interesting to you. We use this information to keep you informed about those suited to you. It also helps us to identify and notify you when market conditions are favorable to you.
