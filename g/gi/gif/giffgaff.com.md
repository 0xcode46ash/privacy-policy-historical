Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered – this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. giffgaff cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

  4. Non-EEA Use of Information  
The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws.

Additional terms and conditions may be presented when signing up for specific products and Services.

  6. FAQS on other related issues  
How to avoid receiving Spam 
    1. Think before you give out your e-mail address  
Try to avoid giving your main e-mail address on web sites, chatrooms, newsgroups or to companies. There are many places online that provide free e-mail accounts. You could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an Internet service, or for online shopping. This way your main e-mail address cannot be “harvested” by spammers. Avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions. These lists of addresses can be used by spammers.
    2. Never reply to Spam  
This includes the notorious “click here to unsubscribe” trick. While it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e-mail, in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e-mail address is active, leading to yet more Spam being sent. Don’t click it – just delete the e-mail.  
You should also avoid trying to Spam the spammers, you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself.
    3. Blocks and Filters  
Your Webmail has simple Spam blocking features already. Have a look for the pages on “spam” or “junk mail” in the ‘Help’ section of the Webmail service. If you are downloading emails onto your home PC, then email your Internet Service Provider or search their website to find out about Spam blocking services they may offer. There are various software programs to help you block Spam.
    4. To prevent cold calling to your mobile phone, you should register your number with the Telephone Preference Service. Visit [www.tpsonline.org.uk](http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/ "www.tpsonline.org.uk")
