## Protecting our Customers' Online Rights

### Our Policy

Giftster does not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information regarding its customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held in strict confidence and security, and we will not use it in ways to which you have not consented. When you register at Giftster, we automatically place you on our list to receive a one-time greeting email, birthday reminders, and e-mail regarding updates about new features or to ask for your input. If you do not wish to receive e-mail updates, please send an e-mail to [support @ giftster.com](mailto:support@Giftster.com)

### Use of Information

Giftster will not collect any personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Examples of such information are: name, postal address, e-mail address, gift preferences, wish list ideas, and event dates. Giftster may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, but Giftster does not sell or share any information at the individual customer level. 

### Browser Cookies

Giftster uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Giftster creates and then uses these cookie files to track your clicks as you go through the Giftster Web site. Giftster uses cookies to keep track of items you purchase, to tell us whether you have visited Giftster previously, and to help us determine whether you came to Giftster from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement.

Cookies help save and retrieve passwords used on the Giftster site and information on your past purchases and other preferences, so you don't have to re-enter this information every time you visit the Giftster Web site. Giftster cannot use cookies to retrieve any personal information about you unless you have previously purchased from or registered with Giftster. Giftster does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from any other location on your computer. 

### Monetization of Web Links

Some links from Giftster to third party ecommerce sites are monetized by third party services. Giftster gets "credit" for its part in helping match the buyer with the right item from the right seller for the gift recipient. This monetization is automatic and transparent and does not affect the item price. This disclosure is provided in accordance with the United States Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR § 255.5

### Usability Studies to Improve Giftster
