**Blackhawk U.S. Online and Mobile Privacy Practices**

**Introduction and Scope of Practices.**

In these Online and Mobile Privacy Practices (“Practices”), “Blackhawk” (or “we,” “us,” or “our”) means any United States subsidiary of Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc., including, but not limited to Blackhawk Network, Inc., Blackhawk Network California, Inc., and Cardpool, Inc.  These Practices apply to your interactions with Blackhawk at any online or mobile site or application that we own and control (“Site”), unless different practices are posted at a particular site or are made available to you and by their terms supplant these Practices.

Other privacy policies may also apply in addition to these Practices.  For example, the Blackhawk U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice applies to all United States customers and consumers.  For United States account holders and visitors to this Site, we will use and share any information that we collect from or about you in accordance with the Blackhawk U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice.

These Practices explain how Sites may collect, use, and share information from or about you.  They also explain certain data use functionalities of our online advertisements (such as banner ads) on third‑party sites.  Please note that when we have another type of presence on a site owned by a third party (such as a page or handle on a social media site), that third party’s privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, will govern unless specifically stated otherwise.

By using this Site, you agree to these Practices.

**Types of Information We Collect**

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**.  PII means personally identifiable information, including name, address, telephone, fax or mobile numbers, account numbers, Social Security or other identifying numbers, and the like.

Third parties do not collect PII about you or your activities from your use of our Sites.

**How We Use Personally Identifiable Information We Collect Online**

You may request that certain information that you enter into our Sites be stored for future access and use. You have the option not to save the information;

**“Do Not Track” Preferences**

Many browsers provide you an option to request that a web application disable either its tracking and/or cross‑site user tracking of an individual user.  We do not track your online activities across different Sites, and we only track your activity within a Site to the extent you log into your account.  Our third‑party service providers do not obtain PII from your use of our Sites.

Therefore, our practices remain the same whether or not you enable the “Do Not Track” feature.

**Protecting Children’s Privacy Online**

Our Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide PII through our Sites. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent.

**Updates to these Practices**

These U.S. Online and Mobile Privacy Practices are subject to change.  Please review them from time to time.  If we make changes to these Practices, we will revise the “Late Updated” date at the top of the Practices.  Any changes to these Practices will become effective when we post the revised Practices on our Sites.  Your use of a Site following these changes means that you accept the revised Practices.
