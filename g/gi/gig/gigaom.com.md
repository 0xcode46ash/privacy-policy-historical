This Privacy Policy covers GigaOM’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that GigaOM gathers when you are accessing the GigaOM Pro Site and when you use the GigaOM Pro services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers GigaOM’s treatment of any Personal Information that GigaOM’s business partners share with GigaOM.

Downloading products and/or research through the GigaOM Pro Site is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

You always have the option not to provide the information requested. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the GigaOM.com websites, but you may be unable to access certain features and services provided by GigaOM. When you register to receive any products or services from GigaOM or provide information to GigaOM in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information.
