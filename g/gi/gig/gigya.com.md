_Effective 05/25/2008_ **Gigya Privacy Policy**

Gigya, Inc. (“ ** _Gigya_** ”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use the [www.gigya.com](http://www.gigya.com/) site (the **_“Site”_** ) and when you use our Wildfire services and software via our Site or on the websites of our partners or other third parties (collectively, the **_“Services”_** ). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services, (including that which we collect on your behalf) when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site or offered by Gigya through the Services

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. 

**Information Collection: Personally Identifiable Information**

  * In the course of using the Services, we will ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account ( ** _“Personal Information”_** ). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. 
  * When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service ( ** _“Log Data”_** ). This Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site and information you search for on a Site. When a user creates a widget, we may record data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget and any other account related data. 
  * Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. 
  * You may avoid accepting cookies from Gigya by simply not using the services or by [disabling Gigya cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625201314id_/http%3A//www.gigya.com/public/content/DisableCookies.aspx) on your computer.
  * Third party advertisers on the Site or that you interact with through the Services (including any widgets) may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser, which permit them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements and content. The collection and use of such information is subject to such third party’s privacy policy.



_Information Collected on Behalf of Our Users._ When you deploy our Services on a website (including deployment of a widget containing your advertising content) and/or provide a widget for a third party to place on their website or social networking site web page, as your agent and on your behalf we may collect certain tracking and usage data generated or provided by End Users ( ** _“Usage Data”_** ). This information includes general widget usage patterns and related campaign success rates. You may also request that we receive or gather personally identifiable information as part of that Usage Data, including but not limited to the email addresses of End Users. Other than as necessary to provide you with the Services, as directed by you or where we have received information independently from the End User (e.g. where an End User registers with us through the Site), Gigya will not review, access, share or disclose Usage Data.

**_“End User”_** means a visitor to or user of a widget or website that was created with or includes the Services. If you are an End User please note that the information you provide to us may be shared with the Gigya user running our Services. We recommend that you see the privacy policies of such Gigya user or the relevant website for information regarding their privacy practices. 

**Our Policy Toward Children**

Gigya does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@gigya-inc.com](mailto:privacy@gigya-inc.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

_Registered Gigya Users and End Users of Gigya Socialize._ In addition to your username, any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or Services will be publicly available. For example, if you are using the social community networking features of our Service hosted by us or a Gigya user running our Services on their website, the information you publish will be viewable by other users. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage Gigya users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions. 

_End User Information._ We may share End User information with the Gigya user for whom we collected such information. 

_Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information._ We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. 

_Service Providers._ We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of the Services (including, without limitation, bill and credit card payment processing, maintenance, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 

_Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement._ Gigya cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Gigya or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. 

_Business Transfers._ Gigya may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. 

**Emailing Via a Gigya Account**

Users that register for the Gigya email service may send emails through use of their accounts. Where registered Gigya users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Gigya to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the Gigya user creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. 

**Changing or Deleting Your Information**

All registered Gigya users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the “user preferences” associated with their account. If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

Gigya is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of industry-standard measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. 

**International Transfer**

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Gigya, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. 

**Links to Other Site**

The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
