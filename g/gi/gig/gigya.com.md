# Privacy Policy - Gigya

_Effective May 9, 2010_ **Gigya Privacy Policy**   


Gigya, Inc. (“ ** _Gigya_** ”) is a technology company offering a set of web-delivered tools and services for establishing and optimizing a site’s connection with many social providers such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo! and LinkedIn. The Gigya social optimization platform enables online businesses (“Developers”) to (a) easily connect their sites to all the major social platforms and integrate with Open ID and other external authentication providers; (b) offer their site visitors (“End Users”) on-site authentication, sharing and social features to enhance their connected experience; and (c) analyze a site’s social activity with helpful use data and metrics. Gigya’s technology also enables Developers and their End Users to easily distribute web content applications such as photos, videos and other widgets (“Web Applications”) to social networks and a wide variety of other web destinations, and directly to mobile devices. 

We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our privacy practices as they pertain to our website, www.gigya.com (the “Site”). We also intend for this policy to inform you about our privacy practices as they pertain to your use of our Web Applications and services (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies to all aspects of the Service, whether made available or accessed via our Site, via the websites of our partners, via other third parties, or on mobile devices. 

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. 

**What Information do you collect?**  


_Personally Identifiable Information_  
Gigya collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) via the Site and the Service. PII is any information that may be used to contact, identify or locate an individual, and includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and postal addresses. We generally collect PII under the following scenarios: 

  * When you choose to provide us with your PII via the Site; including, when you send us an email asking a question, we use that information to answer your question and will store it for a reasonable time. 
  * Gigya periodically publishes an email newsletter. If you provide Gigya with your email address for the purposes of receiving Gigya’s email newsletter, we may also email you with further information and offers from Gigya and/or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided within the email. 
  * The Service may enable you to send emails to your friends. If you provide your email address or your friends’ email addresses for these purposes, we will store those email addresses, but will not use them to send promotional emails to you or your friends (unless you or your friends independently sign up to receive promotional emails from us.)
  * When Developers and our Clients register to use the Service via the Site, we collect their name, company, email address, website URL and telephone number. We also ask them to select a password for their account. We use this information to help maintain their account.
  * If you choose to use the Service via one of the many open standards for user authentication and access control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, etc.) that enable you to link the Service with accounts you have already established with social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and/or email platforms (e.g., Yahoo! Mail), Gigya will collect the PII as well as other information that you have already provided to the social networking or email platform. This PII may include your name, email address, postal address, and demographic information such as age, gender and income. Although we won’t use your PII in this manner without your affirmative (“Opt-in”) consent, we may use the demographic information collected this way to increase the relevance of the content and the advertisements that you see while online. In all instances, we obtain and use this information in accordance with the policies of the social networking or email platform.
  * When Developers or Clients use the Service and collect PII, Gigya will immediately transfer the PII back to the Developer or Client and cache such PII for a reasonable time, in order to improve the performance of the service. Please note that information collected by such Web Applications is subject to that particular Developer or Client’s privacy policy, and that Gigya is merely facilitating the collection and transfer of the PII in accordance with that privacy policy. Gigya takes reasonable steps to ensure that our Developers and Clients update their privacy policies accordingly
  * Public Forums. While Gigya takes precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the PII you submit to us via the Site and/or Service, please note that any information posted to publicly facing sections of the Site or Service will be publicly available. For example, if you are using the social community networking features of our Service, the information you post there (e.g., your opinion about your favorite sports team) will be viewable by others. Similarly, if you post comments on the Gigya Forums section of the Site located at [ http://forum.gigya.com/forum](http://forum.gigya.com/forum), such information will also be available to the public. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much you want others to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and we encourage everyone to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose via this or any other public forum.
  * Emailing via a Gigya Account. End Users may be afforded the opportunity to deploy emails via the Service. Where End Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Gigya to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the Gigya End User creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. We caution all End Users to utilize this email functionality in a responsible manner.



_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_   
We also collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) via the Site and Service. Non-PII is information that may not, on its own, be used to identify or locate a personal or entity, and includes your IP address, browser type, and your computer’s operating system.

This information is used for Site maintenance, to target or otherwise enhance the advertisements you see while online, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes. Please note that Web Developers and Clients may also collect Non-PII as it pertains to their Web Applications, and that the information collected by the Service and transferred to Clients and Developers is subject to that particular Developer or Client’s privacy policy.

If you'd like to opt-out from having Gigya collect and use your Non-PII in connection with our Wildfire content sharing service, please [ click here](http://www.gigya.com/public/content/DisableCookies.aspx). When you opt-out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.

The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Site and Service. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**International Transfer – Storage in the United States**  
Information collected on this Site or via the Service may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
