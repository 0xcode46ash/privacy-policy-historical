# Privacy Policy: Gilead

Gilead Sciences respects the privacy of our visitors to our website. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information collected or submitted to us through our website. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Gilead online through our websites, not offline.

**Consent**  
By accessing or submitting information through our website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Personal Information**  
"Personal Information" is information about you that can individually identify you. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address, email address, or phone number and other information that is not otherwise generally publicly available. Personal Information you submit to us is used either to provide you with information you have specifically requested or to aid us in serving you better. We may use your Personal Information to communicate with you about new products in which you may be interested or about new information regarding our company.

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We do not intentionally share your Personal Information with unauthorized third parties. We may share your Personal Information with our agents that, for example, administer our email subscriptions and requests for information, or provide services in connection with employment applications, and in other ways that allow us to fulfill requests that you make. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances (such as pursuant to a subpoena), or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary.

You may contact us to update or correct your Personal Information at any time if you believe there are errors. You may also contact us to opt-out from our mailings and other services that you may have signed up for. Please use the email address shown at the end of this Privacy Policy, include the words "Personal Information" in the subject line of your message, and make sure that the message contains sufficient information to identify you and your Personal Information as well as what needs correction, and also include a telephone number in case we need to contact you about your request.

**Anonymous Data**  
As you navigate our website, certain information regarding your use of the website will also be automatically collected, including Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, web beacons, navigational data and similar items. ("Cookies" are a form of data that tracks how your browser interacts with our website and help to customize your experience with the website. "Beacons" are an image or pixel tag that help track general usage patterns of the people that visit our website.) This type of information will be used for the purposes of gathering data to provide improved administration of our website and to improve the quality of your experience when interacting with our website.

**Regarding Children**  
Our website is not designed for children under the age of 13. We will not deliberately gather Personal Information about visitors in this age group, and do not collect any information on this website with respect to age.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Our provision of a link to any other website that is not controlled by Gilead is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and cannot be responsible for, these third party websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.

**Data Security**  
When you complete a Medical Information Request Form and subscribe to our product emailing lists, we use industry-standard methods to secure the communication of Personal Information from your computer to our servers. We use industry-standard methods of securing our databases of Personal Information, including the use of firewalls. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we limit access to Personal Information databases to those persons in our organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no company, including Gilead, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.

**Business Transfers**  
In some cases, Gilead Sciences may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if our company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by the acquirer. You should be aware that such transfers may occur, and consent to such a transfer and that any acquirer may continue to use such information (including Personal Information) as set forth in this policy.

**Privacy Policy Updates**  
This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and any changes will be posted on this site. If you object to any such changes, you must cease using our website. Continued use of our website following notice of any such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. This policy was last updated July 2007.

If you have any queries or complaints about our compliance with this Privacy Policy or if you would like to make any recommendations or comments to improve the quality of our Privacy Policy, please contact the Gilead Public Affairs department.
