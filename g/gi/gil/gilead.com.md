# Gilead Privacy Statement | Gilead

In the regular course of business, Gilead interacts and communicates directly with health care professionals, customers, employees, clinical trial participants, consumers, business partners, regulatory authorities, and others. Through these interactions and communications, Personal Information may be provided to Gilead and processed electronically and/or manually. Gilead respects individual privacy and values the confidence of such individuals. This Privacy Statement sets forth Gilead's privacy principles with respect to Personal Information, including the implementation of privacy procedures and technical security measures to keep Personal Information private and secure. Gilead will take reasonable steps to ensure that all Personal Information is captured, managed, stored, and transmitted in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable privacy or data protection laws, which may be supplemented or superseded by applicable legal requirements in local jurisdictions.

This Privacy Statement applies to all Personal Information received by Gilead (including Personal Information received by third-party organizations or individuals acting as Agents of Gilead) as part of Gilead's business operations, in any format, including electronic or paper.

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the following definitions shall apply:

"Agent" means any third party that collects and/or uses Personal Information under the instructions of, and solely for, Gilead or to which Gilead discloses Personal Information for use on Gilead's behalf.

"Gilead" means Gilead Sciences, Inc., its successors and wholly owned subsidiaries.

"Gilead Website(s)" means websites controlled by Gilead.

"Personal Information" means any information or set of information that identifies or is used by or on behalf of Gilead to identify an individual. Examples of Personal Information include an individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Personal Information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public Personal Information.

"Sensitive Personal Information" is a type of Personal Information received by Gilead from any source that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or that concerns health or sexual orientation about an individual.

NOTICE: The collection, use, and/or disclosure of Personal Information in the business context is essential to the conduct of many of Gilead's business functions. Where Gilead collects Personal Information directly from individuals, Gilead will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses their Personal Information, the types of third parties to which Gilead discloses Personal Information, and the choices and means, if any, Gilead offers individuals for limiting the use and/or disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to Gilead, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Gilead uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.

For example, without limitation, Gilead may collect Personal Information for the purposes of employment, disease management, education, decision support systems, requests for product information, clinical trials, registration for Gilead programs, customer service support, marketing or Gilead surveys. Individuals should not provide Gilead with any Personal Information that is not specifically requested. Where Gilead receives Personal Information from its subsidiaries, affiliates, or other entities, it will use and/or disclose such Personal Information in accordance with the notices provided by such entities and the limitations on such use and/or disclosure authorized or consented to by the individuals to whom such Personal Information relates.

Gilead may consolidate the Personal Information of individuals who provide such Personal Information to Gilead. In addition, Gilead may consolidate information in a non-identifiable form (aggregate/anonymous data) to help Gilead better design Gilead Websites and Gilead products and services, to enhance Gilead's research activities, and to facilitate other business functions.

CHOICE: As appropriate, Gilead will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-in/out) whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected and/or authorized or consented to by the individual. Gilead will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices. Gilead may be prevented from providing certain services to individuals who opt-out of use or disclosure of their Personal Information.

Gilead may disclose, subject to applicable laws and regulations, Personal Information without an individual's consent (opt-in) to Agents which assist Gilead with its business activities. Such Agents may include, but are not limited to, service providers that administer Gilead's email subscriptions and requests for information or provide services in connection with employment applications. Gilead requires such Agents to keep Personal Information confidential and to use and/or disclose Personal Information only to perform functions for Gilead and in accordance with Gilead's instructions and this Privacy Statement.

For Sensitive Personal Information, Gilead will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly authorize or consent (opt-in) to the disclosure of their Sensitive Personal Information to a non-Agent third party or the use of their Sensitive Personal Information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected and/or authorized or consented to by the individual.

Gilead reserves the right to disclose Personal Information to respond to authorized information requests from government authorities or when otherwise required by law when Gilead believes that disclosure is necessary to protect individuals' rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.

Gilead may also use and/or disclose Personal Information, in accordance with applicable law, in connection with a contemplated or actual reorganization of its business, when seeking financing or in connection with an assignment, sale, or other transaction involving the disposal of all or part of its business or assets, including for the purpose of permitting the parties to conduct due diligence so as to determine whether a transaction should proceed. In any assignment or sale, the assignee or purchaser may use and/or disclose Personal Information collected by Gilead for substantially the same purposes as described in this Privacy Statement. Such transfer may be subject to individuals' consent when required by applicable law.

We will not share your Personal Information with third parties except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement.

DATA INTEGRITY: Gilead will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected and/or authorized or consented to by the individual. Gilead will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. In general, Gilead will only store Personal Information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, subject to applicable data retention periods imposed upon Gilead by applicable law.

TRANSFERS TO AGENTS: Gilead will obtain assurances from its Agents that they will safeguard Personal Information consistent with this statement. An example of appropriate assurances that may be provided by Agents include a contractual obligation that the Agents provide at least the same level of protection as is required by Gilead's privacy principles. Where Gilead has knowledge that an Agent is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Statement, Gilead will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.

ACCESS AND CORRECTION: Access to Personal Information is limited to a restricted number of Gilead employees, Agents with whom Gilead contracts to carry out business activities for Gilead, and, to the extent applicable, certain companies with which Gilead may conduct joint programs. Gilead trains its employees about the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage Personal Information appropriately and securely. Personal Information handled by Gilead Agents or companies with which Gilead may conduct joint programs is governed by this Privacy Statement.

Upon written request, Gilead will grant individuals reasonable access to Personal Information that it holds about them. In addition, Gilead will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete, subject to certain exceptions. In some instances applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require Gilead to refuse to provide some or all of an individual's Personal Information. In addition, Personal Information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with Gilead's record retention obligations and practices. In the event that Gilead cannot provide an individual with access to his/her Personal Information, Gilead will endeavor to provide the individual with an explanation, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

Individuals may revoke (opt-out) at any time, with certain limitations, their consent and/or authorization to use and/or share their Personal Information. All requests to revoke or amend consent and/or authorization should be in writing to Gilead as directed below under DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

SECURITY: Gilead will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

ENFORCEMENT: Gilead will conduct periodic compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Statement.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal Information and requests to opt-out of future communications from Gilead or a particular Gilead program should be directed to Gilead by telephone at (800) GILEAD5 or +1 (650) 522-5775 or by e-mail at [privacy@gilead.com](mailto:privacy@gilead.com).

E-mail requests to delete, amend, or correct Personal Information should include "Deletion Request" or "Amendment/Correction Request", as applicable, in the subject line of the e-mail. Gilead will endeavor to respond to all reasonable requests in a timely manner, and in any case, no less than thirty (30) days from receipt of such request.
