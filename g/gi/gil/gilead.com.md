# Gilead -- Privacy Policy

Gilead Sciences respects the privacy of our visitors to our website. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information you submit to us through our website. "Personal Information" is information about you that can individually identify you. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address, email address, or phone number and other information that is not otherwise publicly available. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Gilead online through our websites, not offline.

**User Consent**  
By submitting Personal Information through our website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Anonymous Data**  
As you navigate our website, certain information regarding your use of the website will also be automatically collected, including Internet Protocol addresses, cookies and navigational data. This type of information will be used for the purposes of gathering data to provide improved administration of our website and to improve the quality of your experience when interacting with our website.

**Use of Personal Information**  
Personal Information you submit to us is used either to provide you with information you have specifically requested or to aid us in serving you better. We may use your Personal Information to communicate with you about new products in which you may be interested or about new information regarding our company.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
We do not intentionally share your Personal Information with unauthorized third parties. We may share your Personal Information with third party service providers that, for example, administer our email subscriptions and requests for information, or provide services in connection with employment applications.

We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances (such as pursuant to a subpoena), or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary.

**Regarding Children**  
Our website is not designed for children under the age of 13. We will not deliberately gather Personal Information about visitors in this age group, and do not collect any information on this website with respect to age. Gilead abides by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in the United States.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Our provision of a link to any other website that is not controlled by Gilead is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review and cannot be responsible for, these third party websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.

**Data Security**  
When you complete a Medical Information Request Form and subscribe to our product emailing lists, we use industry-standard methods to secure the communication of Personal Information from your computer to our servers. We use industry-standard methods of securing our databases of Personal Information, including the use of firewalls. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we limit access to Personal Information databases to those persons in our organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no company, including Gilead, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.

**Privacy Policy Updates**  
This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and any changes will be posted on this site. If you object to any such changes, you must cease using our website. Continued use of our website following notice of any such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. This policy was last updated August 2004.

If you have any queries or complaints about our compliance with this Privacy Policy or if you would like to make any recommendations or comments to improve the quality of our Privacy Policy, please contact the Gilead Public Affairs department.
