# Private Policy | Gild

Skip to content

  * Information You Provide: You may provide to Gild what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, education history and other resume information, video interviews, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the Gild Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Gild Service.
  * “Automatically Collected” Information: When you access the Gild Service (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Gild Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Gild Service.
  * “Cookies” Information: When you access the Gild Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Gild may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Gild Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings or to opt out of cookies. Note, however, if you opt out of cookies, the Service will not be fully functional.
  * “Pixel Tags” or “Clear Gifs”: A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Gild Service but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
  * Information from Other Sources: We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and sources other than the Gild Service, as well as from other users of the Gild Service. If we combine or associate information from such other sources with personal information that we collect through the Gild Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  * Gild uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide the various features and services found on the Gild Service as well as to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.
  * We may use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Gild Service updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices.
  * Gild uses the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Gild Service works and looks, and to create new products, services, features, and functionality.
  * Gild may use “Automatically Collected” information and “Cookies” information to: (a) automatically update the Gild application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Gild Service; (c) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.

  * Gild does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Gild Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
  * Additionally, in order to enable potential hiring parties to find and hire you, the Gild Service allows recruiters, employers, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resources professionals to view and search user profiles on the Gild Service. The information shared with such entities may include the information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise collected about you (whether from you or third-party sources).
  * Gild may disclose aggregated, anonymous Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, promotions, or other functionality on the Gild Service.
  * We may disclose some limited user information to affiliated companies, contractors or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Gild in improving the Gild Service and creating new Service features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
  * Gild may disclose user information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, judicial or other government requirement, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
  * Gild also reserves the right to disclose user information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Service; protect Gild from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amount owed to Gild; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Gild Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Gild, our users, or others.

Gild uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in an effort to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Gild, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Gild makes commercially reasonable efforts in an effort to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Gild learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Gild may post a notice on the Gild Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [privacy@gild.com](mailto:privacy@gild.com).

If Gild learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years-of-age has been collected on or through the Gild Service, then Gild will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Gild Service member, then please contact Gild at [privacy@gild.com](mailto:privacy@gild.com) to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.
