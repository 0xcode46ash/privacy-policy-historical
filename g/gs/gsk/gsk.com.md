  * Privacy statement



**Updated 29 July 2010**

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) respects the privacy of visitors to its websites and is committed to the protection of their personal information. This Privacy Statement explains the data collection, transfer, processing, use, disclosure, and security practices of the ‘gsk.com’ website (the “Site”).

Note that this Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected from offline resources and communications.

## Binding nature

By accessing and using the Site, you agree and consent to the collection, transfer, processing, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as outlined in this Privacy Statement. 

## Description of the information GSK may collect and how it is used

### 1\. Personally Identifiable Information

GSK directly collects personally identifiable information (i.e., information from which you can be identified, such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) only when it is asked for and/or you voluntarily submit it to us on this Site. We may use the information to respond to your requests,; improve our level of service and the content of our Site; provide you with tips, helpful information, product news and updates; notify you of new GSK products and services (where you have agreed to this); seek your views on our products and services; consider your application for employment; and for our own administrative and quality assurance purposes.

This Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this Site from visitors in that age group without the explicit consent of a parent or guardian.

**How we protect your personally identifiable information**

GSK is committed to using commercially reasonable means to ensure that your personally identifiable information is protected appropriately, and according to the sensitivity of the information. GSK uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personally identifiable information you provide to GSK on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of the personally identifiable information you transmit to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, once we have received your information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

**Sharing personally identifiable information with third parties**

GSK will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties. Sometimes selected third parties are however used to provide GSK with support services in connection with the Site and such parties may, from time to time, have access to your information to enable them to provide those services to GSK. Please rest assured that all companies providing such support services are required by GSK to meet the same standards of data protection as GSK and are prohibited from using the information for their own purposes.  In particular, GSK does not allow its service providers to use your personally identifiable information for their own marketing activities.

In certain special cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:

  1. when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with GSK's rights, property or operations, other users of this Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; 
  2. when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation; or 
  3. in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a product line or division, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



Personally identifiable information collected on the Site may be transferred to, stored and processed in your country of residence or any other country in which GSK or its affiliates, subcontractors or agents maintain facilities, including the United States and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  You should also note that your information may be processed in countries with lower data protection standards than your country of residence. By using the Site, you consent to any transfer, processing or storing of information outside of your country of residence, and outside the EEA. GSK will ensure that if information is transferred outside your country of residence, it will still be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

**Access**

You have a right to update or correct your personally identifiable information at any time by contacting us in writing, as specified at the end of this Privacy Statement. You may have the right to access information held about you pursuant to your local laws and can be exercised in accordance with such laws. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

### 2\. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

GSK also automatically collects (where available) information about your browser type and operating system, websites you visited before and after visiting the Site, standard server log information and IP Address (see below). 

This information (which does not identify any individual) is aggregated to gather data such as the total number of visits to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' internet service providers. We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our visitors use our Site so that we may improve it and the services we offer. We may also share this aggregated information with other companies within the GSK group and with other third parties. NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROCESS. 

**Use of IP Addresses**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your organisation's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. 

GSK, or third party companies acting on behalf of GSK, may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the use of our Site. We do not ordinarily link a user's IP address to information that directly identifies that user, which means each user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we may use IP addresses to identify users of our Site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's terms of use, or to protect our service, Site or other users. 

**Cookies**

This Site may use technology called "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site or help us analyse usage of the Site more accurately. For instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which cookies are used, we will not collect information that directly identifies you. The only personally identifiable information GSK collects directly is the information you voluntarily provide.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web Browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored, if you prefer. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions and to specify your cookie preferences. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this Site or any other websites that you visit.

If you wish to disable the Site’s ability to passively collect information about your website interactions as described in Section 2 above, you have the ability to opt out of such collection. [Go to this link](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7#optout "Opens in new window") and follow the Opt-Out Policy Instructions. The opt-out process will require that you permit the placement of a cookie on your computer that indicates that you do not wish that we automatically collect information about your website interactions. In the event you remove your cookies from your computer or if you change computers or Web browsers, such collection will automatically resume. 

**Links to other web sites**

This Site may from time to time provide links to other GSK and third party websites as a service to our users. This Privacy Statement does not apply to those websites. You agree that, if you choose to enter such a linked site, that GSK is not responsible for the availability of such websites and does not review or endorse and shall not be liable, directly or indirectly, for (i) how these websites treat your personally identifiable information, (ii) the content of such websites, including (without limitation) any advertising, products, goods or other materials or services available from such websites and (iii) the use that others make of these websites.

**Please ensure that you check the legal and privacy statement posted on each website you link to before entering any personally identifiable information.** ****

**Changes**

We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement. If the changes we make are material, we also may post a notice on this Site. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personally identifiable information we collect. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the Privacy Statement and any updates.
