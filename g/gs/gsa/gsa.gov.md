If your browser accepts cookies, we may use a session cookie to decide if you are a repeat or a new visitor. We also use session cookies so we can lean how many different visitors come to [www.gsa.gov](http://www.gsa.gov/). We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to you. When we look at this data, it is always presented in an aggregate form. We do not track or look at an individual’s use of our site.

If you send us personal information

When you send us personal information (e.g., in an electronic mail message containing a question or comment) or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information, we only use this information to respond to your request. We may forward your e-mail to the government employee who can best answer your questions. We do not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.

_**We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide that information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any information we receive with anyone else.**_

Links to other sites:

The pages on [www.gsa.gov](http://www.gsa.gov/) may include hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations. All links and pointers that are not funded or supported in whole or in part by GSA are clearly identified as external links. These links and pointers are provided for our visitors’ convenience. GSA does not control or guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any information from non-GSA sites.

The inclusion of links and pointers to websites is not intended to assign importance to those sites or to the information contained on those sites. It is also not intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed or products or services offered on these sites.

Personalization:

You can personalize [www.gsa.gov](http://www.gsa.gov/) by describing your role (government, business, or citizen) and your location (by state). You will not be asked for any personal information to use these features.

You can also register for MyGSA. MyGSA allows you to store and manage links to content on our website. These bookmarked links are stored in your MyGSA account and are available to you from any web browser. If you provide personally-identifying information when you register for MyGSA, that information is only used to deliver the content to you. The information is never shared with any third party.

Security:

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, GSA webservers use industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on GSA servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
