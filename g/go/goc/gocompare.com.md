# Gocompare.com » Terms and Conditions

### The agreement 

By using our website and comparison technology you are agreeing to these terms and conditions so that we can deliver to you the cover you require where it is available from online providers for UK insurance and financial service providers. If you do not agree to these terms of use, please refrain from using our website. If you are unsure about any aspect of these Terms & Conditions or have any questions regarding our relationship with you, please contact us. 

### The service 

We provide a fully independent and online insurance search engine, designed to save you time and money when it comes to reviewing your insurance. Not only will we endeavour to find you the most competitive quotes but also provide you with the information required to make an informed choice on which policy best suits your needs. We source products but do not offer advice or make recommendations. We will ask some questions to help source quotations, you will then need to make your own choice about how to proceed. 

After completing an application online via our website, you agree that you will receive an initial email from us. This email will confirm you have used our website and that your quote has been saved for you. You cannot opt out of receiving this email. 

### The company 

Gocompare.com Limited is a limited company registered in England and Wales, registration number 05799376, registered address Unit 6, Imperial Courtyard, Newport, Gwent, NP10 8UL, United Kingdom. We are authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and our Register number is 465053. Our permitted business is advising, arranging and making arrangements with a view to transactions in general insurance. You can check this on the FSA's Register by visiting the FSA's website [www.fsa.gov.uk/register/](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/)† or by contacting the FSA on 0845 606 1234. 

esure Services Limited has a 49% shareholding in Gocompare.com Holdings Limited (which owns 100% of Gocompare.com Limited). esure Services Limited is a member of the esure group of companies. The esure group of companies includes esure Insurance Limited, which trades as esure, Sheilas’ Wheels and First Alternative and esure broker limited, which trades as esure broker and Sheilas’ Wheels Broker. 

However, Gocompare.com and the esure group of companies are completely separate businesses. We do not favour any of the esure brands or its products on any of our comparison services. Gocompare.com’s comparison results pages are ordered according to price and cover, and this is never compromised by affiliation with any business. 

### Your responsibilities 

We will provide you with a quotation based on the information you have provided to us. **It is essential that all information and answers are true and accurate and that you also disclose all relevant facts. If you do not provide accurate information and disclose all relevant facts this could lead to your insurance being invalid and claims may not be paid.** If your insurance is invalid, you could also be liable for any third party costs in the event of an accident. 

In order to accept a quotation provided by our price comparison technology, you will need to link to the underlying insurance company website and retrieve your details to accept the policy or, where applicable, contact them by phone. Before accepting a policy it is of the utmost importance that all the information the insurance company holds on you is accurate. It is therefore important that you carefully read through the information on the insurance company's website to check that it is correct and that you have disclosed all relevant facts. Neither we nor the insurance company checks the information you input into our price comparison website so you must check it. If your information is not correct, or if you have failed to disclose all material facts, your insurance may be invalid and claims may not be paid. 

It is important that you read the insurance company's terms or conditions to check that you understand and agree with them. The insurance company's terms or conditions are not the same as ours and they will be the terms which you will be agreeing to when accepting a quotation. 

It is important that you read all insurance documents issued to you and ensure that you are aware of the cover, limits and other terms that apply. Particular attention must be paid to any warranties and conditions as failure to comply with them could invalidate your policy. **In addition, you should check that all your details on the policy documentation are correct, including any assumptions that may have been made on your behalf by the insurer. Failure to inform the insurance provider of any errors or omissions could invalidate your policy.**

If the information supplied by you is not correct, it is your responsibility to identify the mistake on the insurance company's website. We do not accept any responsibility to you if your insurance is invalid because you made a mistake in providing the correct information or if you failed to disclose relevant facts to us or to the insurer. 

If you have any doubt whether further information about you, not requested during the Gocompare.com service, is required to be disclosed to the insurer or if you think that something shown on the insurance company's website may be incorrect, please contact the proposed insurer **before** you accept the quotation. 

### Complaints 

We set ourselves very high standards and look to provide these high standards in everything we do, but we also know there may be occasions when you feel we have not achieved this. In these rare cases we want you to tell us as this is the only way we'll be able to improve our service. How do you do this? Well, you can write, telephone, fax or send an email to us and we will look to resolve the matter as quickly and as fairly as possible.

  * For compulsory classes of insurance (such as Third Party Motor or Employers Liability), insurance advising and arranging is covered for 100% of the claim without any upper limit

### Privacy statement 

#### Data protection 

This policy has been developed because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information entered on our website. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your information as required by law. Our security procedures mean that we may ask for proof of your identity before we will disclose information about you, or to you, be this on our website or over the telephone. 

In order to provide our service to you we need to collect and process personal information about you and disclose that information to a number of third party service providers. This information is necessary to provide you with the quotations you have requested. All personal information will be held in strictest confidence and used only for the purposes for providing you the service requested with certain caveats as described below. 

#### Information disclosure 

Our comparison technology will disclose the information you have entered into the Gocompare.com website to our partner websites for the purpose of providing us with quotations on the requested product. We will also be using your data for our own research and for tracking any purchased policies. By using our website you are giving us permission to use your data in this way. 

Except as set out in this Privacy Statement, we will not disclose any of your information to other parties without your permission unless we are legally required to do so by, for example, a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime. By submitting information into our website, you consent to the processing of this data about you by us and the product providers. We may also use the information you supply to keep you informed of current or new products and services, perform market research or to remind you when your renewal is due. 

If you are not happy for your data to be used in this way, you can [unsubscribe](http://www.gocompare.com/quoteprocess/general_unsubscribe.aspx) to remove your details from our contact list.

#### Unsolicited emails and phone calls 

Most websites will send a confirmation email once a quote has been completed on their website, but as we go to a large number of websites with our technology, you could receive further emails or phone calls from our partners. To prevent this from happening we will not opt-in to marketing communications on any of the underlying websites. By taking this route for you, you should not receive any communication from any of the providers other than those outlined in this Privacy Statement. Although we cannot guarantee this we do have contractual arrangements in place to prevent our partners doing this, so please let us know if you do experience any problems. 

If you click through to a third party website from our website, we cannot guarantee you will not be contacted by these parties. We recommend that you read their Terms & Conditions regarding your right to opt-in or out of receiving further contact from them. 

#### Your personal data 

Gocompare.com complies with and is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data. Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998, you have a number of rights. If you require a copy of the information we have concerning you, please write to the Data Protection Officer and enclose a cheque for the administration fee of £10.00 made payable to Gocompare.com. We are entitled to charge you this fee to cover our administrative costs. We reserve the right to amend or modify this privacy statement at any time and in response to changes in applicable data protection and privacy legislation. 

#### How we use your personal data 

Your personal information is used for the purpose of getting you an insurance quote. Additionally, Gocompare.com and other carefully selected third parties may use your information to keep you informed by post, telephone, SMS or email about current and new products and services which may be of interest to you. Your information may also be disclosed and used for these purposes after your policy has lapsed. 

If you are not happy for your data to be used in this way, please click on the [unsubscribe me](http://www.gocompare.com/quoteprocess/general_unsubscribe.aspx) link and you will be able to remove your details from our contact list. If you have further queries with regards to your personal data, please feel free to email us on [unsubscribe@gocompare.com](mailto:unsubscribe@gocompare.com) or write to us at:

#### Help with choosing 

If you have not ticked the box in the section entitled “Helping you complete your purchase”, you agree that your details may be used by the top two competing individual service providers who provided you with the cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quote. They may also highlight any special offers or ways they might be able to help you get an even cheaper price with them. Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected. They are only entitled to contact you on this particular quotation and only for a limited period of time, after which they are obliged to consider your details as 'off limits' i.e. opted-out under the terminology of the Data Protection Act 1998. Some partners may also contact you by telephone if you click through to their website to help you with any queries you may have, regardless of their position in the results. 

#### Monitoring 

Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, text messages and other communications may take place in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes, such as for quality control and training; processing necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract; to prevent unauthorised use of our telecommunication systems and websites; to ensure effective systems operation; to meet any legal obligation; in order to prevent or detect crime; and for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the data controller. Please visit the following websites for further information [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)† and [www.bis.gov.uk](http://www.bis.gov.uk/)†. 

#### Confidentiality 

We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. Other than under the terms of this Privacy Statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone. We would like to bring your attention though to our obligations to disclose information in the following four exceptional cases permitted by law. These are where we are legally compelled to do so; where there is a duty to the public to disclose; where disclosure is required to protect our interest; and where disclosure is made at your request or with your consent. 

If relevant, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers Information Centre (MIIC). 

This may be consulted by the Police in order to establish who is insured to drive the vehicle. 

If you are involved in an accident, (in the UK or abroad), other UK Insurance companies, the Motor Insurers Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to ascertain relevant policy information. Persons with a valid claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain certain information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this at [www.mib.org.uk](http://www.mib.org.uk/)†. 

Should you take the decision to make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman in existence at the time. You can be assured that they are similarly obliged to adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998 and keep your information strictly confidential. 

#### Credit searches 

Many insurance and financial services providers operate a credit scoring system and will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. These checks will include electoral roll and credit information. The insurance checks are registered as general insurance searches and may be viewed by other companies when you apply for credit or insurance. Often the financial services quotes you request will only do a credit check once you have decided on a particular supplier. Every application you submit for a loan or credit card may affect your credit scoring so you may wish to keep applications to a minimum for your credit rating. Again, this is not happening specifically because you are using our service. This may happen regardless of whether you get a quote via the internet or phone for any of these services. PLEASE REMEMBER while we do not carry out credit searches on our website, our partners may do so at any stage of the quote process. 

#### Cookies and IP addresses 

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet. They allow us to make our website more useful based on stored information about your preferences when you visit us. We do not store cookies beyond such interaction. If you choose to, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from our service, although you may not be able to experience the full service we provide if cookies are disabled. Further information can be obtained from the [Interactive Advertising Bureau](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)†, an industry body that has produced a series of web pages which explain how cookies work and how they can be managed. 

Your IP address is a series of numbers which identify a computer on the internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose possible service interruptions and administer our service and website. 

#### Law 

These terms of trading are subject to English law and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. You acknowledge that by providing data to us, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this privacy and security statement. 

### Security statement 

#### Website security 

We use the industry standard secure sockets layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption technology to ensure that all your personal and transactional information is encrypted before transmission. To check that you are in a secure area of our website look at the bottom of your browser and you will see a closed padlock. All this technology and our policies are to safeguard your privacy from unauthorised access/improper use and we will continue to update these measures as new technology becomes available. 

#### Third party site security 

If you use links on our website that lead you to external websites (including when you link through to purchase a policy), we will have no control over the way your information will be processed. As other websites may handle your information in a different way, we recommend that you check the privacy policies of each website that you visit. 

#### Passwords 

In order to provide you with maximum protection, we ask you to choose a password to access your data on our website. In many instances, this password will also access the quotes we find for you on the web. Some providers might allocate you a different password, which we will send you information about. Your password is unique to you and helps us to protect your personal information. You must keep this password safe and must not disclose it to anyone. You will need your password to access your personal information and potentially to buy cover through one of the insurance providers. Please contact us if you want to change your password for any reason. 

If you forget your password don't panic! Simply click on “forgotten password”. 

#### Be aware 

Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as emails/webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.
