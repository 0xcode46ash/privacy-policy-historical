# Gocompare.com >> Privacy Statement

## Data protection 

This policy has been developed because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information entered on our website. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your information as required by law. Our security procedures mean that we may ask for proof of your identity before we will disclose information about you, or to you, be this on our website or over the telephone. 

In order to provide our service to you we need to collect and process personal information about you and disclose that information to a number of third party service providers. This information is necessary to provide you with the quotations you have requested. All personal information will be held in strictest confidence and used only for the purposes for providing you the service requested with certain caveats as described below. 

## Information disclosure 

Our comparison technology will disclose the information you have entered into the Gocompare.com website to our partner websites for the purpose of providing us with quotations on the requested product. We will also be using your data for our own research and for tracking any purchased policies. By using our website you are giving us permission to use your data in this way. 

Except as set out in this Privacy Statement, we will not disclose any of your information to other parties without your permission unless we are legally required to do so by, for example, a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime. By submitting information into our website, you consent to the processing of this data about you by us and the product providers. We may also use the information you supply to keep you informed of current or new products and services, or to remind you when your renewal is due. 

If you are not happy for your data to be used in this way, you can [unsubscribe](https://www.gocompare.com/quoteprocess/general_unsubscribe.aspx) to remove your details from our contact list. If you have further queries with regards to your personal data, please feel free to email us on [unsubscribe@gocompare.com](mailto:unsubscribe@gocompare.com) or write to us at:

## Unsolicited emails and phone calls

Most websites will send a confirmation email once a quote has been completed on their website, but as we go to a large number of websites with our technology, you could receive further emails or phone calls from our partners. To prevent this from happening we will not opt-in to marketing communications on any of the underlying websites. By taking this route for you, you should not receive any communication from any of the providers other than those outlined in this Privacy Statement. Although we cannot guarantee this we do have contractual arrangements in place to prevent our partners doing this, so please let us know if you do experience any problems. 

If you click through to a third party website from our website, we cannot guarantee you will not be contacted by these parties. We recommend that you read their Terms & Conditions regarding your right to opt-in or out of receiving further contact from them 

## Your personal data

Gocompare.com complies with and is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data. Under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998, if you require a copy of the information we have concerning you, please write to the Data Protection Officer and enclose a cheque for the administration fee of £10.00 made payable to Gocompare.com. We are entitled to charge you this fee under the Data Protection Act 1998 to cover our administrative costs. We reserve the right to amend or modify this privacy statement at any time and in response to changes in applicable data protection and privacy legislation. 

## How we use your personal data 

Your personal information is used for the purpose of getting you an insurance quote. Additionally, Gocompare.com and other carefully selected third parties may use your information to keep you informed by post, telephone, SMS or email about current and new products and services which may be of interest to you. Your information may also be disclosed and used for these purposes after your policy has lapsed. 

If you are not happy for your data to be used in this way, please click on the [unsubscribe me](https://www.gocompare.com/quoteprocess/general_unsubscribe.aspx) link and you will be able to remove your details from our contact list.

## Help with choosing

If you have not ticked the box in the section entitled "Helping you complete your purchase", you agree that your details may be used by the top two competing individual service providers who provided you with the cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quote. They may also highlight any special offers or ways they might be able to help you get an even cheaper price with them. Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected. They are only entitled to contact you on this particular quotation and only for a limited period of time, after which they are obliged to consider your details as 'off limits' i.e. opted-out under the terminology of the Data Protection Act 1998. Some partners may also contact you by telephone if you click through to their website to help you with any queries you may have, regardless of their position in the results. 

## Monitoring

Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, text messages and other communications may take place in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes, such as for quality control and training; processing necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract; to prevent unauthorised use of our telecommunication systems and websites; to ensure effective systems operation; to meet any legal obligation; in order to prevent or detect crime; and for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the data controller. Please visit the following websites for further information [www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)† and [www.berr.gov.uk](http://www.berr.gov.uk/)†. 

## Confidentiality

We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. Other than under the terms of this Privacy Statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone. We would like to bring your attention though to our obligations to disclose information in the following four exceptional cases permitted by law. These are where we are legally compelled to do so; where there is a duty to the public to disclose; where disclosure is required to protect our interest; and where disclosure is made at your request or with your consent. 

If relevant, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers Information Centre (MIIC). 

This may be consulted by the Police in order to establish who is insured to drive the vehicle. 

If you are involved in an accident, (in the UK or abroad), other UK Insurance companies, the Motor Insurers Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to ascertain relevant policy information. Persons with a valid claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain certain information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this at [www.miic.org.uk](http://www.miic.org.uk/)†

Should you take the decision to make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman in existence at the time. You can be assured that they are similarly obliged to adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998 and keep your information strictly confidential. 

## Credit searches

Many insurance and financial services providers operate a credit scoring system and will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. These checks will include electoral roll and credit information. The insurance checks are registered as general insurance searches and may be viewed by other companies when you apply for credit or insurance. Often the financial services quotes you request will only do a credit check once you have decided on a particular supplier. Every application you submit for a loan or credit card may affect your credit scoring so you may wish to keep applications to a minimum for your credit rating. Again, this is not happening specifically because you are using our service. This may happen regardless of whether you get a quote via the internet or phone for any of these services. PLEASE REMEMBER while we do not carry out credit searches on our website, our partners may do so at any stage of the quote process. 

## Cookies and IP addresses

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet. They allow us to make our website more useful based on stored information about your preferences when you visit us. We do not store cookies beyond such interaction. If you choose to, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from our service, although you may not be able to experience the full service we provide if cookies are disabled. Further information can be obtained from the [Interactive Advertising Bureau](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)†, an industry body that has produced a series of web which explain how cookies work and how they can be managed. 

Your IP address is a series of numbers which identify a computer on the internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose possible service interruptions and administer our service and website. 

## Law

These terms of trading are subject to English law and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. You acknowledge that by providing data to us, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this privacy and security statement.
