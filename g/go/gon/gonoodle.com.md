# Privacy Policy - GoNoodle

Last updated September 15, 2014

The website [www.gonoodle.com](https://www.gonoodle.com/) and the GoNoodle mobile applications (together “GoNoodle”) are owned and operated by HealthTeacher, Inc. (“HealthTeacher”, “we”, “our” or “us”).

We created GoNoodle to help teachers give students fun, interactive brain breaks to keep them focused and engaged throughout the school day. GoNoodle’s brain breaks are now available to kids and their parents outside the classroom. Your privacy and the privacy of children who use GoNoodle are important to us, and we created this Privacy Policy to inform you of the information we collect when you use the Site, how we use it, and how we share it with others. HealthTeacher has developed its privacy practices to adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

#### Information we collect from parents and educators

GoNoodle is primarily directed to educators and parents, and they may register their own accounts. When a parent or educator registers, we collect first name, last name, email address, username, zip code, date of birth and password. 

#### Information we collect from children

When a child registers for GoNoodle, we collect the child’s first name, username, password and the parent’s email address. We use the parent’s email address to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the child’s GoNoodle account, to notify the parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either about the parent or child’s GoNoodle account or about features of our website, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If the parent does not consent to the child’s use of GoNoodle within 10 days of the child’s registration, we will delete all information collected from the child during registration. 

#### Information we automatically collect from all users

When a user registers for GoNoodle, and each time a user logs into GoNoodle to play a brain game, we automatically collect the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer or mobile device being used to access GoNoodle as wells as information about the user’s web browser. This information is used only to provide an enhanced on-line experience for our visitors by optimizing our web pages for your computer (e.g.: the identity of your Internet browser (e.g., Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you use (Mac or Windows), and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may also use this non-personal information to develop utilization data on our Site.

We may also use cookies ⎯ small files that we place in a user’s computer browser to collect information regarding preferences ⎯ for internal purposes. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you turn off cookies, you will not have access to some of the features that make your experience on our Site smoother, and some of our services may not function properly.

### HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We use the information collected from children and from parents for internal purposes only, such as helping users keep track of the brain breaks they have played, to help us understand the general location of GoNoodle’s users, and to help us operate and improve GoNoodle.

We use the parents’ email address to communicate about their children’s use of GoNoodle, and to notify parents of activities in their area related to GoNoodle brain breaks that may interest them. Parents may opt out of receiving email communications at any time. 

### THIRD PARTIES

We do not sell, exchange or share any of the personal information we collect from GoNoodle users with any other entity.

### HOW PARENTS CAN ACCESS THEIR CHILDREN’S ACCOUNT

The email a parent receives from us after his or her child registers to use GoNoodle will include a link to a GoNoodle page where the parent can authorize his or her child’s use of GoNoodle. If the parent authorizes the child, the parent will be prompted to create his or her own GoN0odle account. The parent will be able to use this account to keep track of his or her child’s use of GoNoodle.

### ACCOUNT DELETION

Users may request deletion of their accounts, and parents may request deletion of their children’s accounts by emailing [support@gonoodle.com](mailto:support@gonoodle.com). Parents can also delete their children’s accounts directly by logging into GoNoodle.com and deleting a child from the dashboard.

When you delete your account or your child’s account, all of your information is permanently deleted, and cannot be recovered.
