# Privacy Policy – GoNoodle

Last updated: October 21, 2015

Welcome to www.gonoodle.com, our mobile and set-top box applications (“Application”), and our pages on Twitter.com, Facebook.com, Pinterest.com, Google.com, and Instagram.com (collectively, the “Site”). The Site is owned and operated by GoNoodle, Inc. (“GoNoodle”, “we”, “us” or “our”).

We created GoNoodle to get kids moving throughout the day at school and home. GoNoodle’s activities are available to teachers for use in the classroom and to kids outside the classroom. Your privacy and the privacy of children who use GoNoodle are important to us, and we created this Privacy Policy to inform you of the information we collect when you use the Site, how we use it, and how we share it with others. GoNoodle has developed its privacy practices to adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

#### Information we collect from educators

When an educator registers, we collect first name, last name, email address, username, zip code, date of birth, password, and the school in which they teach/use GoNoodle.

#### Information we collect from children

When a child registers for GoNoodle, we collect a username and password. A child can unlock additional functionality in GoNoodle for free by obtaining parental verification. To obtain verification, we ask the child to provide their parent’s email address. We use the parent’s email address to send the parent a message that can be used to verify the child’s GoNoodle account, to notify the parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either about the child’s GoNoodle account or about features of our website, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If the parent does not verify their child’s use of GoNoodle within 10 days of the child providing their email address, we will delete the parent’s email address from our system.

#### Information we collect during device activation

When a user activates our Application on a device (e.g., Apple TV), we collect a vendor ID, parent email address, country, and zip code. Activation is not complete until we obtain parental verification. To obtain verification, we use the parent’s email address to send the parent a message that can be used to verify the device activation, to notify the parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either about the child’s GoNoodle account or about features of our Site, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If the parent does not confirm device activation within 10 days, we will delete the parent’s email address from our system.

#### Information we automatically collect from all users

When a user registers for GoNoodle, and each time a user logs into GoNoodle to play a movement video, we automatically collect the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer or mobile device being used to access GoNoodle as wells as information about the user’s web browser or app. This information is used only to provide an enhanced on-line experience for our visitors by optimizing our web pages for your computer or device (e.g.: the identity of your Internet browser (e.g., Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you use (Mac or Windows), and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may also use this non-personal information to develop utilization data on our Site.

We use the parents’ email address to communicate about their children’s use of GoNoodle, to let them know about updates to the Site, and to notify parents of offers related to GoNoodle activities that may interest them. Parents may opt out of receiving email communications at any time.
