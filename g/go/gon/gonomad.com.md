# Our Privacy Statement

| 

**GoNOMAD.com Privacy Statement**

We know how important your privacy is and GoNOMAD.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of its visitors and listing businesses. We want you to be able to browse our site, join the GoNOMAD NETWORK and make use of our Members' Bulletin Boards, contests, special services and offers, without being contacted by unwanted sales people and solicitors. 

_Please take the time to review our Privacy Statement to understand what we do to protect you._

GoNOMAD.com will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us, nor will such information be sold, rented, or otherwise transferred to third parties. If you are a registered GoNOMAD BUSINESS NETWORK Member, any and all information we collect to process your registration or serve you will not be sold, rented or otherwise transferred to any third party. 

##### What data is collected?

If you visit our site, we collect and store only the following information about you: 

  1. The name of the domain from which you access the Internet; The date and time you access our site; and 
  2. The Internet address of the website you used to link directly to our site. 



If you join the GoNOMAD TRAVELER NETWORK, we will collect your email address, which will be used to send email newsletters or other member communications. Business member information includes name, address and contact information, and may include credit card information for payment purposes only. 

##### What do you use the data for?

All information collected is for statistical purposes. GoNOMAD.com uses software programs to create summary statistics for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. We also use the data to determine and control site security and to better understand the needs of our visitors and listing businesses. 

These statistics become aggregate, anonymous information (e.g. "25% of our site visitors are interested in culinary travel") which GoNOMAD.com will provide to partners, advertisers, sponsors and third parties. Such aggregate data cannot be linked to any one person. If you purchase any books or other merchandise from a GoNOMAD MARKET vendor, the vendor may disclose certain information to GoNOMAD.com for commission tracking and statistical purposes. The vendor may also use the data for its own tracking and statistical purposes. For more information on vendors' privacy policies, please contact them directly. 

##### Is there any other kind of personal data you might use?

If you identify yourself by sending us an e-mail containing personal information, the information collected will be solely used to respond to your message. If you provide any information in connection with a contest, survey or promotion, that information will be used for general statistical purposes and/or to contact you if you are a contest winner. To the extent that GoNOMAD.com has access to your personal information, it will disclose it when required by law enforcement or other appropriate governmental authorities, or if the personal information is pertinent in a legal proceeding or court action. 

##### What about listing businesses?

All listing businesses are expected to follow the privacy policy of GoNOMAD.com. However, because GoNOMAD.com is not a supervisory agent or owner, listing businesses may use information gathered from you at their own site for their statistical or promotional purposes, or for other arrangements. If you are concerned about the privacy policies of any GoNOMAD BUSINESS NETWORK MEMBERS, please contact them directly.
