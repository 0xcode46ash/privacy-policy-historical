**How We Use Your Information**

We use your e-mail address to send you invitations to participate in surveys and to contact you with messages regarding panel information. We use your postal address to mail any survey-related rewards, prizes and incentives or to assign you to demographic and geographic groups as required by research projects.

We use the information we automatically receive from your web browser to see which pages you visit within our site, which site you visited before coming to ours, and where you go after you leave. We can then develop statistics that are helpful to understanding how this site is used by our visitors. This statistical data is interpreted by us in our continuing effort to present the web site content that visitors are seeking in a format they find most helpful.

We support the rights of our members by limiting the use of their information for legitimate marketing research purposes and are active in supporting the following organizations created to uphold ethical survey research (this support includes making every effort to conform to the organizations’ ethical standards):

  * American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR)
  * American Marketing Association (AMA)
  * Advertising Research Foundation (ARF)
  * Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO)
  * European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR)
  * Marketing Research Association (MRA)
  * Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA)



We also strive to conform with FTC Safe Harbor regulations regarding data protection in the European Union; the FTCs Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and other privacy regulations and guidelines in the US and other countries.

Your information is used solely for research purposes. We will never try to sell you anything; we are only interested in your opinions. When you complete a survey, your responses are analyzed in aggregate with all other respondents’ information and reported not individually, but only in the aggregate. Our research clients will never receive personal information of our panel members, nor will they be able to identify panel members, without your express permission.

We will never share your e-mail address or personally identifiable information with anyone except an approved agent or sub-contractor we may engage for activities like reward fulfillment and data verification. All agents or sub-contractors must sign a confidentiality or “chain of trust” agreement.

We may disclose your personal information to a third party when required to do so by law, or to protect someone’s safety, or our rights or property.

**Updating Your Information**

We encourage you to update your contact information as it changes. To help you do this, we set up member accounts for all members. These can only be accessed via a password which you establish. You can update your information in the following ways:

  * By sending an e-mail request to our members’ services team at: panelservices@ gongos.com
  * By visiting your member account via our community web site and following the instructions there.

**Children’s Privacy Protection**

We believe that it’s especially important to protect children’s privacy online and encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.

We comply with all applicable national and international children’s privacy regulations.

We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. We do not permit children who are under 13 years of age to become panel members without parental consent and we do not collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age without parental consent. As part of the registration process for new panel members, we may collect from the new panel member the names of each individual in the panel members’ household, which may include the names of children who are under 13 years of age. Occasionally we may send a survey to a panel member who is a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 that asks that panel member to have his or her child who is under 13 answer the survey. We take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such procedure by sending the survey to the parent or guardian’s password- protected email address. The information collected in response to such surveys is not combined with identifying information about the child. In every case such survey does not collect personal information about the child.

If a panel member has provided us with personal information about a child in the panel member’s household who is under the age of 13, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or mailing address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy if he or she would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our databases.

**Links**

When taking a survey, you may have the opportunity to link to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of those sites. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of each site you visit.

**Use Of Cookies**

Like many other websites, we use cookies to provide a better experience for our members. We limit their use for quality control and validation. Cookies are used temporarily during the time you are actively completing a survey or filling out the registration forms and we do not store or retain your cookie information in any way. You always have the option to disable cookies while registering or completing a survey without affecting your participation. No personally identifiable information is transmitted via these cookies.

Additionally, we may invite you to take part in surveys where a third-party client requires placement of cookies in order to take part in a particular survey opportunity. Such cookies will never be placed without your knowledge and without explaining to you their purpose. You will always have a choice to decline the placement of such a cookie.

**Data Security**

We take the security of your information seriously. We will not activate a potential registrant’s account without confirmation. Once the registration process is completed, the individual is sent an email that requests he or she confirm his or her registration. The account will not be activated until confirmation is received. Additionally, all website members are required to use their passwords and usernames (email addresses) when registering, updating their contact information, or when accessing “members only” sections of the websites.

Access to your personal information is restricted and limited to select Company staff members who have a need to access such information to complete a legitimate business purpose, and access is subject a strict password policy. Our employees receive training in data privacy and protection.

We will never ask you for information such as credit card or social security numbers, although we may be required by law to request your social security number when sending you a check for very large cash prizes.

We have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

All website members are required to use their e-mail address and a password when updating their contact information, or when accessing “members only” sections of our websites. If you forget your password, you can send a message to our secure system to retrieve it.

We employ commercially reasonable technology and internal processes to protect the information our members release to us.

All surveys are screened by Company staff before sending you an invitation to ensure they are proper and appropriate for their intended audiences.

While navigating our websites you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not on a Company-owned domain. When information is collected on behalf of Company exclusively, our privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For sites not owned by us, the site owner’s privacy policy will be referenced.

In the unlikely event that we suffer a breach of our security systems and an individual or entity gains unauthorized access to any information stored on our servers, we will immediately investigate such security breach, and will provide prompt notice to any individual whose information was affected.

**Opting-Out Of Our Panels**

If you choose to end your membership in any of our panels, you may automatically resign by clicking on <http://gongos.com/RemoveMe.aspx>. In addition, in each email invitation sent to members of our respondent database, we provide the opportunity to opt-out of receipt of further mailings. If you choose to end your membership via either of these methods, your panelist membership record will be deactivated and you will no longer receive invitations from us, although you may continue to receive some previously-prepared invitations for a few days. We apologize for any such inconvenience.

After you resign from our panel, we will continue to maintain your personal information in our servers for historical and statistical purposes, as well as in our database of individuals who have unsubscribed from our panel to ensure that you do not receive further email survey invitations from us.

Our current privacy protection terms will continue to protect your data even after your resignation.

**Transfer Of Information**

We reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information to a buyer in connection with a sale of stock or assets, merger, or any other change of control transaction. Any acquirer would be required to honor our privacy policy.

**Contacting Us**

Please contact us at panelservices@gongos.com with any questions. We respond to most e-mail inquires by the end of the following business day. You can also contact us by phone at 248-239-2300. Please ask for Panel Services or by postal mail at Attn: Panel Services, Gongos, Inc., 2365 Pontiac Road, Auburn Hills, MI 48326

**Changes To This Policy**

We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. Current panel members will be notified of any changes to our privacy policy via e-mail or via a message posted on our website.
