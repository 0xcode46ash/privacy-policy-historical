**What's the difference between Security and Privacy?**   
Security involves making sure that any sensitive information you may provide to us is handled in a safe and secure manner. Privacy refers to information we gather about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.

Certain personal or business information may be collected from visitors to WholesaleFurnitureBrokers.com. You may need to fill out these forms to register, purchase items, take part in special promotions and activate our faster, easier checkout. We use your contact information to speed up the order process, and to contact you when you request or when it is necessary (for example, if there is a problem fulfilling your order). WholesaleFurnitureBrokers.com does not govern any other websites but may occasionally provide links to other websites, which have their own privacy practices.. We also may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve your shopping experience and our site design.

This will be plainly stated in the rules and regulations when applicable. We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required by law; or (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or (3) investigating fraud that has already taken place.
