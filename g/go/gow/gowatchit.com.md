# Privacy | GoWatchIt

Plexus Entertainment, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“Plexus”) is the owner and operator of GoWatchIt.com. We take the privacy of your personal information seriously. This Privacy Policy tells you how Plexus collects, uses and protects the information you provide in visiting GoWatchIt.com and using the services offered and the circumstances under which Plexus may disclose such information to third parties. This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Use posted elsewhere on GoWatchIt.com, sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of GoWatchit.com and the services offered thereby. Depending on your activities when visiting GoWatchIt.com, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions. 

WHEN YOU ACCESS GOWATCHIT.COM, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING GOWATCHIT.COM. By accepting this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use in registration, you expressly consent to the management of your personal information by Plexus as described herein. 

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment by Plexus of information we collect when you register to use GoWatchIt.com and use the services offered. This policy does not describe the information collection and/or use policies on third party websites, including those linked on GoWatchIt.com.

**The Information We Collect**

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:** Plexus receives and stores any information you provide to us. The types of personal information collected may include your name, email address, zip code or other elective demographic information. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account, responding to your requests, improving the content of the services offered, customizing the advertising and content you see and communicating with you about specials and new features.

**Information Collected Automatically:** When you use the services offered at GoWatchIt.com, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, including your IP address, cookie information, the time and date of your visit, the pages that you access, browser type and configuration, the number of times you return to the website, your viewing preferences and your purchase history on third party sites. This information is not used to specifically identify you.

**Other Sources:** Plexus may periodically receive information about you from other sources such as updated address information. Any such information is then added to our account information.

**How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**

The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information for our products or services or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us on GoWatchIt.com. You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from Plexus at any time. In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with third party vendors performing functions on our behalf (e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.). Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via GoWatchIt.com, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via GoWatchIt.com. Further, Plexus may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.

**How We Use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**

Plexus uses non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services. We may use your non-personal information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your non-personal information with third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.

**Other Uses and Information:**

**IP Addresses:** An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that “serve up” web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from GoWatchIt.com, our servers typically log their IP addresses. Plexus collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others and to track the use of GoWatchIt.com. IP addresses are considered non-personal information and may also be shared as provided above. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. However, Plexus reserves the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; or (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, GoWatchIt.com, or other users.

**Cookies, etc.:** “Cookies” are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. These text files make using a website more convenient by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not typically contain any personally identifiable information. Plexus may analyze the information derived from these cookies and other technological tools we employ and match this information with data provided by you or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any of your personally identifiable information. Please note that advertisers that serve advertisements on GoWatchIt.com may also use their own cookies and other technological tools which are subject to the advertiser’s privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your internet browser or other programs. Please note, however, that some parts of GoWatchIt.com may not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.

**Email Communications:** If you send us an email with questions or comments, Plexus may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. For security reasons, we do not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social security numbers or bank account information to us by email. However, aside from our reply to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, it relates to purchases you have made with us, we are sending you information about our other products and services, or you consented to being contacted by email for a particular purpose. In certain instances, we may provide you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may “opt out” of receiving future commercial email communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer service communications.

**Other:** Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personal information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to notices and counter-notices pursuant to our DMCA notice and takedown policy and procedures and/or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; or (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, GoWatchIt.com or other users.

**Children:** The features, programs, promotions and other aspects of GoWatchIt.com requiring the submission of personally identifiable information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personally identifiable information to us please contact us at info@gowatchit.com. A parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such child’s personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof. 

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** Plexus works closely with affiliated businesses that may offer and sell products or services to you or provide promotions to you through the GoWatchIt.com platform. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and Plexus will share your personal information with that business as needed to complete the transaction. At times, Plexus may share your personally identifiable information among different affiliated businesses. This information will be used to improve the content of GoWatchIt.com and to customize the content you see.

**Advertising Partners We Do Not Control:** GoWatchIt.com may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these advertisers or third-party websites. These third-party advertisers may use “cookies” or web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Plexus does not have access to or control over “cookies” or other features that such third-party advertisers may use and the information practices of such third-party advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

**Public Forums:** Plexus may offer chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards or similar public forums where you and other users of GoWatchIt.com can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personal information) in connection with your use of these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal information about you to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through GoWatchIt.com.

**Data Control Options**

You can always choose not to provide information, even if it means that you will no longer be able to receive certain updated information from us or participate in the services that we provide. You may choose to opt out of promotional correspondence, such as newsletters, by indicating your preference on the registration page or by adjusting your preferences after you have registered. You may also select “private” when registering as a new user to opt out of sharing your personalized movie queue with social media sites. If you have already registered, you may adjust your preferences at any time.

**How we protect the Security of Your Information**

Plexus maintains an information security program that uses reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of your personal information. All of your personal information, including user names and passwords, is encrypted. While Plexus strives to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and expressly disclaim responsible and/or liability for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as that term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by email (in our sole and absolute discretion) to the last email address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

Plexus reserves the right to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time and your continued use of the services offered by GoWatchIt.com after the institution of any such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If at any point we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you of this change by email to the last email address provided to us. Users will have a choice (by means of an opt out opportunity) as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected if you opt out of the new policy.

**Contact Information**

Questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy should be sent by e-mail to info@gowatchit.com or by U.S. mail to Plexus Entertainment, 295 Greenwich St., #173, NY, NY 10007. You may also contact us if: (a) you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy; (b) wish to make corrections to any personally identifiable information you have provided; (c) want to opt-out from receiving future commercial correspondence, including emails, from us or our partners; or (d) wish to withdraw your consent to sharing your personally identifiable information with others. We will respond to your request and, if applicable and appropriate, make the requested change in our active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may not be able to fulfill certain requests while allowing you access to certain benefits and features of GoWatchIt.com.
