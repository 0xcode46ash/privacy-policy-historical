# Privacy Statement - Google Gooru

**Privacy Policy**

**What We Collect and How We Use It**. Google Gooru, Inc., a Georgia Corporation, doing business under the trade name Google GooruTM  (“we” or “us”) will collect and analyze, when you use our services (the  “Service”), certain non-personally-identifiable information such as meta-data generated and stored on your computer systems and collected through the Google App Engine, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as your browser type and version, operating system, and platform; and Service usage patterns and trends. Customers of the Service may be offered a “cookie”, which can be described as a small text file containing information that is transferred to a visiting computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes during a visit. The use of cookies enables us to analyze Service usage and traffic patterns. A cookie will not give us access to data stored on your computer or to any information other than what is voluntarily provided to us. Most web browsers will automatically accept cookies. There are many methods and applications available for disabling a browser’s handling of cookies, or restricting the exchange of data.

We will use proprietary and third-party products and certain software tools to measure, collect, and analyze the foregoing collected data. We do this in order to analyze the use and performance of the Service and to better understand the needs of our customers. Additionally, we may use non-personally identifiable information for marketing, survey purposes, and Service utilization analyses.  You agree that we act as a “data processor” as provided for in the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).

The information that is collected using the foregoing data and tools is never sold to or shared with any unauthorized third party.

_**By using the Service, you have consented to the collection and use of the data provided to us as outlined in this Privacy Policy.**_

**Personally Identifiable Information**.  We are committed to ensuring our customers’ privacy.  Your Personal Information is gathered only when you choose to share it.  “Personal Information” is information that identifies an individual, or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person. Your Personal Information is gathered by us when you become a purchaser of the Service by providing us with information such as (by way of an example) your name, email, address, and credit card information.  Additionally, your Personal Information is gathered by us when you sign up for any electronic newsletters and/or promotional or service e-mails that we may now or hereafter offer to our customers from time to time, or when placing a request for customer service by using any “contact” feature we provide.  While we receive and store the Personal Information that you choose to share with us by engaging in any of the foregoing activities, you may always opt-out of sharing Personal Information by discontinuing your use of the Service.  Additionally, you can always choose to opt-out of receiving service and/or promotional e-mail and electronic newsletter communications that we may now or hereafter send to customers from time to time. To the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

We take precautions to insure that our customer’s Personal Information is secured.  We use a variety of industry-standard technical, contractual, administrative and physical security measures and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.  Unless otherwise provided for herein, we restrict access to Personal Information to those employees who need access to perform their essential job functions.  Please note that despite our best efforts, no one can guarantee the security of customer Personal Information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of Personal Information at any time.

**Protecting the Privacy of Minors**. Minors under the age of thirteen (13) are prohibited from using the Service.  Minors under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to use or purchase the Service without the permission and involvement of a parent or legal guardian. We do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under thirteen (13) years old.  Protecting the privacy of minors is very important to us.  Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under thirteen (13) years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information permanently from our databases and Internet servers.

**Legal Compliance**.  We may disclose customer’s Personal Information when such disclosure is: (i) necessary to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (ii) necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other related agreements; or (iii) to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our employees, our customer or other members of the general public. Disclosures made under this paragraph may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations, or governmental agencies.  However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Email Choice/Opt-out**. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Information.  You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing or service purposes.  If now or in the future you receive promotional or electronic newsletter communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving such communications from us, and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by clicking the “Unsubscribe” hyperlink at the bottom of all such communications.  Notwithstanding your indicated email marketing preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding us or the Service, including, for example, order confirmations and notices of updates to our Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service if we choose to provide such notices to you in this manner.

**Business Transfers**.  As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or business units.  In such transactions, customer information, including Personal Information, is generally considered an asset, but remains subject to the terms and conditions of any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, a customer specifically requests otherwise in writing).  Notwithstanding, in the unlikely event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, or a change in control of the majority ownership of us occurs, Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**. From time-to-time we may modify, change, update, add to, remove portions of or otherwise alter this Privacy Policy.  If we make changes, we will post them on our website to make customers aware of what the changes are so customers will always be aware of what information we collect, how we collect and use that information, and when we may disclose such information.  If you object to any such changes, you must immediately cease using the Service. A customer is bound by any changes to this Privacy Policy when the Customer uses the Service after those changes have been posted. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact privacy@googlegooru.com.
