At Good American Kids we strongly believe that respecting and safeguarding your online privacy is our responsibility.

We have not, nor will we ever sell, rent or make available for use, your personal account information to a third party. We use the personal information you give us to process your orders. Your email address will be used to send order and shipping confirmations to you and for relevant correspondence regarding your order. If you choose to receive emails from us regarding our products, services and promotions, you will have an opportunity to unsubscribe at the bottom of each email you receive.

Your credit card information is safe with us. Your information comes to us encrypted, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. Our secure browser technology, SSL, ensures that no one outside of our professional billing staff will have access to your credit card information. As soon as we receive your order, it is transferred to a computer that cannot be accessed from the Internet. To help ensure others will not get access to your credit card information on our website, we urge you to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit, especially if you are sharing your computer with someone else, part of a network at your workplace or are using a computer in a public place.

If you have privacy or security concerns, please email us at contactus@goodamerican.com. Any and all inquiries can also be directed to:
