# Privacy Policy | GoodLife Fitness

## At GoodLife Fitness we are privileged each and every day to help members to achieve their health and fitness goals. We understand the need to protect personal information provided to us and take this role very seriously. Our commitment to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our members’ personal information is addressed in this privacy policy. Our policy complies with the requirements of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada), the Personal Information Protection Act (British Columbia) and the Personal Information Protection Act (Alberta).

We want you to understand why we collect your personal information, how the confidentiality of this information is protected and how you can find out what information concerning you is recorded. This policy applies to all GoodLife Fitness clubs across Canada.

### Accountability

GoodLife Fitness is responsible for your personal information under its control. We have appointed a Chief Privacy Officer who is accountable for our compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please refer to the last page of this policy for information on how to contact our Chief Privacy Officer.

#### Personal Information

Personal information is information about you as an individual, and includes information that identifies you and that can be used to contact you. This includes such information as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, banking information, credit card number, and the like. It may also include information about your health and fitness levels and goals, if you have communicated these to us.

Member data (e.g. check-ins, purchases) may be used in academic research (e.g., exercise adherence). Your data will never be individually identified or identifiable in reports of the research findings; only aggregated data (group averages) will be presented.

#### Identifying Purposes

GoodLife Fitness collects personal information for the following purposes:

• to understand your fitness and other related needs and objectives and to assist you in achieving them  
• to determine your eligibility for membership and for receiving our products and services  
• to process your membership payments and to ensure that your account remains up-to-date  
• to invite you to participate in member surveys or other opinion-gathering devices that assist us in making our clubs more responsive to your needs  
• to inform you of various matters relating to your membership and about our products and services that we believe may be of interest to you 

GoodLife Fitness may also collect information regarding the frequency of your visits to our clubs and about the specific equipment, classes and services that you take advantage of, so that we may constantly strive to offer you the best range of fitness options.

GoodLife Fitness wants to hear from our members regarding any issues or comments they may have with respect to their memberships or any services offered by our clubs. We may record this information and transmit it to our clubs in order to address them in the appropriate manner.

We may also combine your personal information with that of other individuals to create aggregate data which we will use, for example, to improve our products and services and develop new ones. Aggregate data is general information about groups of customers but not about you as an individual.

We will not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or authorized by law.

#### Telecommunications

GoodLife Fitness may ask you for contact information such as your telephone, mobile or fax number or e-mail address, and keep and use this information as well as disclose it to other trusted third parties so that we or any of these third parties may contact you directly through these channels for the purpose of marketing (including telephone and e-mail marketing and automated telephone messages) of goods, services and special offers that may be of interest to you. Your consent to this is not a condition of your membership with GoodLife and you may withdraw it at any time (see below).

#### Consent

Your knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. When you become a member of GoodLife Fitness, you consent to the use of your personal information for the purposes listed above. You may refuse or withdraw your consent at any time; however we may not then be able to provide you with our full range of services. We will advise you when you refuse or withdraw your consent of the impact that will have on what we are able to provide. For information on withdrawing your consent, please contact our Chief Privacy Officer.

#### Third Party Disclosure 

GoodLife Fitness is not in the business of selling member information to others. We do contract with trusted companies to act on our behalf to fulfill certain functions. We may use third party service providers to process or handle personal information on our behalf and to assist us with various services such as data processing, printing, mail distribution and marketing. Some of our service providers are located outside of Canada. As a result, your personal information may be accessible to regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these jurisdictions. We will take steps to ensure that such parties adhere to our policy with respect to the protection of your personal information. 

Except as set out in this policy or as required or permitted by law, GoodLife Fitness will not sell or disclose any of your personal information to any other organization or transmit personal information to third parties without first obtaining your consent. GoodLife Fitness may, however, disclose information in the following cases:

• to our lawyer  
• to comply with a subpoena, warrant or order  
• to a police force, if required by law   
• to a person authorized by a law or collective agreement   
• to an investigative body or government institution which can oblige us to do so   
• in emergency situations in which we believe that the life, health or safety of a member or other person may be in danger   
• to an agent retained by GoodLife in connection with the collection of your account 

## Internet Activities

Examples of digital markers are “cookies” or HTML5 Web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:

  * they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;
