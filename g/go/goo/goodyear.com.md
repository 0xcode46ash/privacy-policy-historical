**On-line Privacy Policy**

**Basic Confidentiality and Privacy Policy**

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, hereafter `Goodyear', considers personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses or telephone number, to be private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff or authorized agents, and is used only to market our products or better serve our customers. Goodyear will not disclose any personal information to other organizations.

**Information Collection**

When you browse a Goodyear web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information is not collected. Some areas of our web sites, however, may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your name, email address, etc., for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, making a purchase, or participating in online surveys.

Goodyear may also retain electronic communications you send to our customer service representatives, webmaster or other associates. These may be shared only within Goodyear as a means to continually improve customer service.

Goodyear web sites track information about the visits to those sites. For example, statistics are compiled that show the daily number of visitors to a site, the daily requests received for particular files on a site, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used to customize our web site to better meet your needs and may also be provided to others, but the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. Certain Goodyear sites may use cookies so that we can better serve site users. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

**Information Use**

Goodyear may use the information users give us to, for example, provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various products and services or inform users about new products and programs. These offers may be based on information provided in surveys, information that may indicate purchasing preferences or email sent to a Goodyear site.

Any lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. Goodyear will use reasonable effort to address all requests to remove names from any postal mail or email lists.

**Disclosure**

Because Goodyear considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information gathered on-line to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings. Goodyear does not sell, rent or transmit personal information to other organizations.

**Other Web Sites**

Goodyear web sites may contain links to other sites, and we make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

**Children**

Goodyear has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information (such as name, address, or telephone number) from individuals under sixteen years of age. Where appropriate, Goodyear will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our web site.

**Disclaimer**

By using a Goodyear site, you signify your assent to the Goodyear On-line Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

**Copyrights**

Copyright 1998 - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company., Akron, Ohio, USA. All rights reserved. The text, images, graphics, sound files, animation files, video files and their arrangement on Goodyear's web sites are all subject to Copyright and other intellectual property protection.
