When you access GoodRx Services, our servers automatically record certain information. These logs include information such as the date and time you access our site, the browser you are using, and other common browser information. We will use this log information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site. Your log information also may be used to gather broad demographic information.

When you are using GoodRx with a browser or mobile device, you can enter a location or explicitly allow GoodRx access to your location. GoodRx collects and stores that information.

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

  * **Price Alerts, Coupons, Discount Cards.**  
We use your email address only to send you price alerts or to send you coupons by email. We use your phone number only to send you coupons by text message if you request that service. We use your mailing address only for mailing you discount cards if you request them. 

  * **Tracking Information.**  
We use location information, the drug information you view while on our Site, the referrer information and, if you are a registered user of the Site, your account information in order to provide you with better, faster service, particularly for recurring visits.

**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH?**

We will only share your name and address with others if you request a discount card to be mailed to the address you provided; and that information will only be shared with the third parties we use to fulfill discount card requests. GoodRx ensures that those third parties are either bound to comply with our privacy policy or have similar privacy policies that protect your information; and we require that they destroy your personal information after your card request is fulfilled.  
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.  
We may request and gather other information from you (for example, your Medicare plan) from time to time. We will not share any personal information with any third party in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless you request a discount card and then only the information described above. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.  
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

**WHAT ABOUT KIDS’ PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume our website is used by adults or minors supervised by a parent are guardian. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

We may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of our Site. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except that we may retain and use limited information, such as the child's email address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where we believe that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA. 

If a parent believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she can contact us via email or postal mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. 

We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
