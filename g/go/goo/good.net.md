# Winstar Communications

|  **Privacy Policy**

Winstar maintains high standards for the protection of privacy over the Internet. The following policy statement explains how Winstar protects the privacy of information transmitted over the Internet from its web-site visitors. 

Generally, Winstar only obtains specific and individualized data about its website visitors when such information is supplied voluntarily, i.e., when web site visitors send e-mail to or purchase services from Winstar. Winstar then uses the information for the purpose of fulfilling the visitors' requests. However, Winstar gathers some generic information automatically, solely to help Winstar determine the success and usefulness of its websites. This generic information, which does not reveal the identity of the visitor, include: what web site the visitor visited, how much time people spend on various pages of the site, visitors' domain name types (.com, .org, etc.), and the originating webpage of the visitor. Winstar uses this information to determine customer service needs. In the future, Winstar may increase its technical abilities for gathering data about visitors in order to enhance the services offered to visitors and customers. This privacy policy will be periodically updated to reflect any such changes to Winstar's practices. 

Winstar's websites may employ "cookies". Cookies are small segments of text that are transmitted to a visitor's web browser and which store information on the visitor's hard drive. This information is later transmitted back to the server that originally sent it to the visitor upon a later visit to that site. Cookies allow servers to recall previous transactions to avoid repetition in data gathering. A visitor can configure its equipment hardware, usually with its browser to make notification when they receive a cookie. The visitor can refuse it. 

Winstar will not sell or reveal information obtained about its visitors to anyone outside of Winstar unless authorized by the visitor, it is legally required, or such disclosure is required to protect the safety of employees, visitors, customers, or property. Winstar does not send "junk" e-mail, also known as "spam". In certain instances, when Winstar wishes to contact customers via e-mail, respond to messages, confirm purchases, or transmit information requested by a visitor, Winstar will use e-mail. Any time a customer or visitor receives e-mail it does not want from Winstar, the customer can request that Winstar not send further e-mail. 

Winstar has security measures in place for protecting data conveyed during a visitor's purchase with Winstar. Winstar's employees, partners and subcontractors are required to protect the privacy of such data. Winstar wants its visitors and customers to feel that their privacy will be protected when the visitor accesses their account or purchases services from Winstar on-line. Winstar denies any responsibility for the privacy protections or content offered by other sites to which Winstar's websites may contain links. 

Because Winstar desires accuracy in the information it obtains and uses about its visitors and customers, Winstar will attempt to verify its data and will ask its customers to notify it of any inaccuracies or mistakes of which they may become aware through their on-line account data and monthly bills.
