  Without giving too much away would you like to inform us.......  


Here's the breakdown in human-talk: I respect your privacy. I'm not going to sell your email address (I don't even ask for it unless you email me personally), I'm not going to try and steal your information, I'm not going to try and do anything Evil. I have tried to keep this site fairly low-key; it doesn't require a log-in and thus you don't have to give me your personal information.

I do make use of cookies: on the [preferences](https://web.archive.org/preferences.jsp) page you have the option of setting a cookie yourself to help improve your experience here (just allows me to customize the tutorial displays for you). Those aren't Evil cookies (feel free to open them in a text editor to double check on that, too). I also run advertisements through third-party networks, and they might place a cookie on your computer, but these are all networks I trust and they're the cream of the crop; these aren't the networks you hear of in the news that do Evil things to you and your information. If I do run across something fishy in my third-party network, trust me, I'll definatley remove it.

With that said, here's the legal-talk of my privacy policy:
