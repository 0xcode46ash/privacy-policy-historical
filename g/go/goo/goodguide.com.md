# GoodGuide | About GoodGuide and GoodGuide Ratings

GoodGuide knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared so we take many steps to protect your privacy. This document sets forth these protections, your use of the websites, mobile applications and other services available at www.GoodGuide.com, through the iPhone and other mobile application sites and stores, and all linked pages (collectively "Service Sites"), lets us know that you acknowledge reading these practices and policies (the "Privacy Policy") and accept them. Please do not use the Service Sites if you do not want the Privacy Policy to apply to you. 

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers GoodGuide's treatment of information that GoodGuide may gather when you access or use the Service Sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to sites owned, operated or controlled by third parties. Information that you provide to such third parties and their sites will be subject to the privacy policies of such sites. 

### What Information Does GoodGuide Collect?

We divide the information that we collect into two categories for the purpose of this Privacy Policy. The first type is personally identifiable information ("PII") - information that can identify you, the use of the Service Sites, as an individual. Examples of PII are names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. The other category is "everything else" - that is, information that is _not_ PII, and cannot identify you as an individual. Examples of this category would be the types of rankings you request (as long as they are not tied to you as an individual), the companies or products you show an interest in, and any statistical or aggregate information. 

We use both types of information that we collect from users, on or through the Service Sites. This allows us to personalize and improve the Service Sites and the services we offer to you. GoodGuide is the sole owner of all information collected on or through the GoodGuide portions of the Service Sites. The following gives a little more background on both categories of information: 

**Information You Provide to Us.** We receive and store any information you supply to us, on or through Service Sites, such as the searches you want performed, or the products or companies you would like evaluated. To use the Service Sites and out sevices you may need to register, and will need to give us PII such as your name and email address as part of the registration process. You can choose not to provide us with information, but then you will not be able to use or take advantage of some of the features or services on or through the Services Sites. The information, including PII, that you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products. If you provide PII to us through one of our services, we may use it for these purposes in connection with other GoodGuide services or Service Sites; for example, if you provide your email address to us in connection with a GoodGuide mobile application you are giving us permission to use that email address in connection with responding to your requests, advising you about other services, and so forth. Information that is _not_ PII is also used as aggregate data, in the manner described below. 

**Information Collected Automatically.** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service Sites. GoodGuide automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page or portion of the Service Sites that you requested. This information may be used to offer you a personalized experience on or through the Service Sites, including, without limitation, to advise you on related Service Sites and services of ours that you may want to access. 

GoodGuide also automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. GoodGuide only uses automatically collected information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables GoodGuide to figure out how users are accessing and using the Service Sites so that we can improve them and focus our efforts on the more popular features. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use the Service Sites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Service Sites, so that they, too, can improve their offerings. 

### Will GoodGuide Share the Information it Collects?

**Aggregate Information.** As noted above, GoodGuide may share aggregate information with others to help improve the Service Sites, our Services, and third party services and products. 

**Contractors.** GoodGuide may contract with other companies and people (e.g., for data analysis, financial and other specialties) to perform tasks on our behalf. We need (and you are authorizing us) to share your information, including PII, with them for the limited purpose of allowing us to fulfill your requests using the Service Sites. We bind these contractors to agreements that prohibit them from using or disclosing any information they receive from GoodGuide for any purposes except the ones they are hired to provide to us. 

**Legal Compliance.** GoodGuide reserves the right to disclose your PII when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to (1) comply with the law; (2) enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; (3) or protect the rights, property or safety of GoodGuide, our employees, our users, or others. 

**Business Transfers.** If a third party acquires GoodGuide or most of its assets, or in the unlikely event that GoodGuide goes out of business through bankruptcy or otherwise, information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired to a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of GoodGuide may continue to use all information, including PII, as long as it does so only as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

### How Secure is My Information?

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, GoodGuide maintains appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure all information that we collect online. Should we collect PII about you through registration, we will protect that PII with a password and logon process. You must, however, ensure that your password is not disclosed to others and it is your responsibility to select an appropriate password and change it regularly. 

### Can I Access or Change My Information?

As noted, you may be required to register to use the Service Sites and GoodGuide services available on or through them, which will require that you provide us with your name and possibly other PII. You may, of course, choose not to provide such PII but in that case you will not be able to access or use all of the features of the Service Sites and our services. For registered users, you will have the opportunity to access and edit all of your PII associated with your registration. 

Automatically gathered and aggregate information cannot be changed or accessed by individuals. As noted, such information does not link to any PII about you. 

### How Do You Use Cookies and Similar Tools?

GoodGuide may use cookies, pixels, widgets and other tools to track session data and allow us to personalize your experience on or through the Service Sites. We do not use cookies, or other tools, to collect or reveal PII to GoodGuide, and we do not combine cookie information with other PII. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, or erasing existing cookies. If you elect to turn off cookies, GoodGuide will not be able to store cookies on your system or collect information from them. However, you will not be able to use the personalized features of the Service Sites and our services that depend on cookies and the information they contain. 

Some of our advertisers may use cookies on the Service Sites, as may the owners of those Service Sites that are not controlled by GoodGuide (including, without limitation, mobile application websites operated by third parties). We have no access or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GoodGuide only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

### Links to Other Sites

Service Sites contain links to other websites, including (but not limited to) the citations to the providers of the databases that we use to rank and evaluate companies and products. These other sites are not owned or controlled by GoodGuide. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. 

### What if You Change the Privacy Policy?

This Privacy Policy is a living document. GoodGuide may amend the Privacy Policy as we add new features to the GoodGuide portions of the Service Sites, our services, or as the law or circumstances change. Accordingly, we need to reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy we will post those changes here, on the GoodGuide homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the changes. Use of particular information or PII will remain subject to whatever version of the Privacy Policy was in effect at the time it was collected. 

### Questions or Concerns

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, the Service Sites, our services or GoodGuide in general please contact us at [info@goodguide.com](mailto:info@goodguide.com).
