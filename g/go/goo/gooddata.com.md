**Personal Information  We Collect From You**

You can visit a GoodData Site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need certain personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from you.

You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address, phone number and company name) through a GoodData Site when you elect to register with GoodData in order to download or access our products or services. When you provide Personal Information in order to register with GoodData, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested products, services content and/or information. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services and to help us manage business development activities. GoodData may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, GoodData may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding GoodData and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

**Information Related to Data Collected for our Clients**

In the case of individuals using the GoodData Platform, GoodData collects information under the direction of its business clients (“Clients”) acting on your behalf and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.  GoodData works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers and end users concerning the purposes for which Personal Information is collected.

**Choice**

If you are a customer of one of our Clients using the GoodData Platform and would no longer like to have your Personal Information used by GoodData or the Client, please contact that Client directly.  If you seek access to data, or seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, collected by GoodData under the direction of our Clients, please direct your query to the Client (the data controller).  If the Client requests GoodData to remove the data, we will respond to the request within 30 business days.

**Service Providers and Onward Transfer**

GoodData may transfer Personal Information that we collect under the direction of our Clients to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to these third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements we have with our Clients.

**Newsletters  **  
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you with a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section of this Privacy Policy.

**Statistical Information**

In addition, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to a GoodData Site to help us provide better customer service and to make a GoodData Site as user friendly as possible. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit a GoodData Site, and we also measure visitor activity on GoodData Sites. However, when we do so, we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. GoodData may use this data to analyze trends and statistics. None of the information described in this paragraph is reviewed at an individual level.

**Cookies  **  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all GoodData Sites. We do not add the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on a GoodData Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate a GoodData Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. GoodData uses persistent cookies to store a unique cryptographic hash value so you do not have to enter your username more than once on a given computer. The information stored does not contain any Personal Information.

**Third Party Cookies**

A GoodData Site may use cookies that permit select third party partners to serve you GoodData-related content on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to a GoodData Site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

**Behavioral Targeting and Re-Targeting**

We partner with a third party advertising partner, or “ad network”, to either display advertising on the GoodData Site(s) or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on the GoodData Site and other Web sites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted advertisements, you may opt out by clicking [here](http://preferences.truste.com/) or [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising altogether.  You will continue to receive generic advertisements.

We use Google AdSense to publish advertisements on select GoodData Sites.  When you view or click on an advertisement, a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other GoodData Sites.  You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Privacy & Terms page for Advertising: <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html>.

**IP Addresses**

When you visit a GoodData Site, GoodData collects your Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, GoodData uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate to a GoodData Site. GoodData also collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the GoodData Platform as part of GoodData's security features.

**Web Beacons/Usage Analytics**

GoodData employs, or our third party advertising partners employ, web beacons and usage analytics software that help us better manage content on a GoodData Site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers' Personal Information.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

A GoodData Site may contain links to other Web sites. GoodData is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. The links from a GoodData Site do not imply that GoodData endorses or has reviewed the third party Web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those Web sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.

**Project Invitations**

If you choose to invite others within your organization to a report or project on a GoodData Site, we will ask you for the other user's name and email address. We will automatically send him/her a one-time email inviting him/her to visit a GoodData Site. GoodData stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Invited users may contact us at [privacy@gooddata.com](mailto:privacy@gooddata.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Blogs/Forums/Chat Rooms/Bulletin Boards**

If you use a blog, forum, chat room or bulletin board on a GoodData Site ("Forum(s)"), you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit in a Forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of such Forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in a Forum. To request removal of your Personal Information from our Forums, contact us at [privacy@gooddata.com](mailto:privacy@gooddata.com).  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Customer Testimonials**

GoodData may post customer testimonials on a GoodData Site, which may contain Personal Information. We obtain our customers’ consent prior to posting their testimonials.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, contact us at [privacy@gooddata.com](mailto:privacy@gooddata.com).

**Social Media Widgets**

GoodData Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on a GoodData Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on a GoodData Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the applicable GoodData Site.  Your interactions with each feature are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Other Information**

GoodData is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  * Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.
  * Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other related companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * Credit Card Processing: We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on GoodData's behalf.
  * Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: GoodData, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide it with the information that it needs to perform its specific function.


  * Legal Requirements: GoodData may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of GoodData, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a GoodData Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.



**Other Disclosures of Personal Information**

GoodData participates in certain third party marketing arrangements using web analytics tools similar to Google analytics. These third party marketing arrangements pool together contact information collected through any GoodData forms or email campaigns and any other opted-in website forms or email campaigns to identify a visitor to the GoodData Site.  Whenever a visitor goes to **_any_** third party opted-in website, GoodData may receive in the pooled marketing reports certain Personal Information about you, limited to your name and email address, even if you have not directly provided us this information.

GoodData may also use cookies to personally identify you so that GoodData can understand your actions on our website. GoodData may receive information that identifies you personally within the third party marketing reports based on links you have clicked in emails or information you have submitted in online web forms.  This Personal Information may be provided to GoodData as a result of information you provide third parties on non-GoodData Web sites.

If you HAVE NOT enabled "Do Not Track" functionality in your web browser, then GoodData may continue to gain access to your Personal Information as identified in the third party marketing reports, based upon your use of and access to non-GoodData Web sites. If you HAVE enabled "Do Not Track" functionality in your web browser, then GoodData’s use of and access to your Personal Information by way of the third party marketing reports will be strictly limited, and your personally identifiable cookies will expire within 48 hours.  GoodData will never share information about your page view visits on our site with other non-GoodData Web sites.  GoodData will never sell your page view visits to any third parties.

**Joint Offerings**

From time to time, GoodData may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service from us, GoodData may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). GoodData does not control our business partners' use of the information we share with them, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

**International Transfer of Information Collected**

To facilitate GoodData's global operations, GoodData may transfer and access information regarding GoodData customers from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if GoodData transfers information regarding GoodData customers to other countries.

**Customer Data**

GoodData customers may electronically submit data or information to the GoodData platform for hosting and processing purposes ("Customer Data"). GoodData will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the GoodData Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. In accordance with the GoodData Terms of Use, GoodData may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the GoodData services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at a GoodData customer's request in connection with customer support matters, or as may be required by law.

**Security  **  
Personal Information collected through a GoodData Site is kept in a secure database and all reasonable precautions are taken to secure this data. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from a GoodData Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to GoodData via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to GoodData via the Internet. The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration pages or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

If you no longer wish to receive our emails, newsletters or other communications you may unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of such communication or by sending us an email at [privacy@gooddata.com](mailto:privacy@gooddata.com).

**Changes to Our Policy**

We may change our business and a GoodData Site from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. GoodData reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide GoodData with any Personal Information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of a GoodData Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy have been published shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
