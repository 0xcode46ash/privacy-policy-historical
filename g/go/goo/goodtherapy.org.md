# Privacy Policy

The last update to our Privacy Policy was posted on August 25, 2014. This Privacy Policy governs the privacy terms of our website, [www.GoodTherapy.org](http://www.goodtherapy.org/). We are committed to maintaining the privacy of GoodTherapy.org Users and Members.

**Information Collection and Use**

GoodTherapy.org collects information from Users at a number of different points on our website.

(A) When a User sends an email to a Member through the GoodTherapy.org website, the User’s name, phone number, email address, and message is recorded as part of the transmission process.

This information is kept confidential and is made available only to (1) trained GoodTherapy.org support team members for purposes of administering GoodTherapy.org, such as moderating for spam or other content that is in violation of GoodTherapy.org terms of service, (2) the therapist(s) Member(s) to whom the User sends the email, and (3) QuartetHealth (“QH”), a referral service authorized by GoodTherapy.org. GoodTherapy.org never rents, sells, or gives this information to any other third party.

When a User emails a therapist Member through the GoodTherapy.org email messaging system, the User is conveniently and automatically emailed a notification when the therapist has been contacted. Additionally, when a User emails a therapist through the GoodTherapy.org email messaging system, they may be automatically subscribed to our monthly email newsletter. Users may unsubscribe from this newsletter by completing the unsubscribe form found [here](http://www.goodtherapy.org/unsubscribe.html). (B) When a User calls a Member through the telephone number posted on the GoodTherapy.org website, standard caller identification information is collected and forwarded to the Member, and may be stored by GoodTherapy.org for use in administering its services. GoodTherapy.org never rents, sells, or gives this information to any third party.  

(C) GoodTherapy.org collects information entered by therapist Members when they register (or try to register) for Membership or public membership. The information about the therapist's practice is made public and can be viewed in any GoodTherapy.org profile. The other information (including but not limited to username, email address, password, etc.) is kept private in a database and may be used by our internal departments if needed (such as debugging errors or analyzing outcome of marketing campaigns) or QH as required. GoodTherapy.org never rents, sells, or gives this information to any other third party.

(D) GoodTherapy.org collects User email addresses when Users subscribe to the blog. This email address is used to send such Users blog post or blog comment summaries and Users can unsubscribe anytime using unsubscribe option(s) found in the email and/or on the site. User email addresses are also used by patient referral services, such as QH, to provide further benefits to Members. GoodTherapy.org never rents, sells, or gives this information to any other third party.

(E) GoodTherapy.org collects information entered by Users when they register (or try to register) for a public web conference or public non-professional membership. This information (including but not limited to name, username, email address, password, etc.) is kept private in a database and may be used by our internal departments if needed (such as debugging errors or analyzing outcome of marketing campaigns) or QH, as requied. GoodTherapy.org never rents, sells, or gives this information to any other third party.
