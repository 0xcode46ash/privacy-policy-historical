### What types of information do we collect?

At Go Overseas, we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable (“Non-PII”) information from you. PII is information that can be used to identify you personally. Non-PII is information that cannot be used individually to identify you but must be combined with other information to identify you personally. 

Here is a breakdown of the ways we collect PII and Non-PII and how it is stored:

  * **As a Go Overseas user,** you can register for an account in a variety of ways, including by signing up for an account, leaving a review, participating for a scholarship or contest, booking a program directly on Go Overseas or through one of our partner providers, asking a question or providing an answer, or adding a program to your wish list. In all of these cases, your information is stored in our servers up until such point as you request your account to be deleted. We also use services including MailChimp and Mandrill to handle email marketing, and your PII may be stored in these systems as well.
  * **As a Go Overseas partner,** if you reach out to any member of our Partner Growth team (including via the [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) email address), your information will be automatically added to our CRM tool, Hubspot. Hubspot will retain PII related to your account to help us provide a better partner experience. 



To the best of our knowledge, all of these tools are GDPR compliant as of May 25, 2018.

### With whom may your personal information be shared?

Go Overseas may need to disclose your PII to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data. Additionally, we may share your PII with third parties that we believe that you might be interested in. It is, therefore, necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.

For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.

We reserve the right to disclose your PII if we believe that you are violating the Terms of Use, or if we believe that you may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Go Overseas rights or property, other users of the Go Overseas site, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

Go Overseas may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.

### When will my information be shared with law enforcement?

We reserve the right to disclose your PII to authorities if compelled to by a court order. Additionally, you agree that we may disclose your information if we reasonably believe that you have violated US laws or the terms of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy or if we believe that a third party is at risk of bodily harm. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.

We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, where your actions violate any law of the United States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Platform, or our Terms of Use. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants. We may release your information under the conditions listed in this paragraph whether it is to individuals or entities and to any state or federal authorities, as required.

### What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

Go Overseas allows you to control the way that we use PII that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, Go Overseas may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Go Overseas may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.

Additionally, you may opt out of some communications by using controls in your Go Overseas account dashboard or update your PII by changing information listed in your account.

Here are the ways we use cookies and pixels on Go Overseas:

  * We use the Google Tag Manager to implement both a Google Analytics pixel and a Facebook pixel. Both of these pixels collect anonymized data which allows us to better understand what you love on Go Overseas and help you find more of that information. Additionally, a select group of our partners also access our Facebook pixel data for advertising purposes.
  * We use a tool called Crazy Egg which collects anonymized, Non-PII data about visitors behavior on Go Overseas. This data is not tied to user accounts in any way but is used as part of our efforts to improve user experience and design across Go Overseas.
