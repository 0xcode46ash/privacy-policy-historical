If a visitor submits information to Go Overseas, it will only take the form of either: 1) account registration, 2) message boards, 3) contest registration, 4) consumer complaint, 5) surveys, 6) customer service, 7) newsletter, 8) the purchase of goods or services. Personal information collected may include your name, phone number and/or email address. We do not require this information to access the site, however, you may not be able to utilize certain features of the site that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide further information such as a valid credit card number and expiration date.

### What other information may we collect?

To create an account with Go Overseas you will be asked to create a username, password and other non-personal information such as your age, gender, location and program preferences. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain information about your computer and site usage. Go Overseas may use this information to generate statistics about our user community and provide such information to our advertisers. Go Overseas may also use this information for security, system integrity or enforcement purposes.

### How do we use your personal information?

The personal information you provide Go Overseas will allow us to fulfill your customer services; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or technical support questions or issues; and/or notify you of contests, promotions, or special events and offers. Go Overseas may enhance or merge the personal information collected with data from third parties. Go Overseas may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.

Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve the community.

Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.

### With whom may your personal information be shared?

Go Overseas may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze, and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Go Overseas rights or property, other users of the Go Overseas site, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Go Overseas and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Go Overseas successor or assign.

Go Overseas may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk.

### What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

Go Overseas allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, Go Overseas may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Go Overseas may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.

### What are cookies and how do you use them?

Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Go Overseas may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes.

### What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Go Overseas may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

### What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact us by e-mailing us at [Privacy@GoOverseas.com](mailto:Privacy@GoOverseas.com).

Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and applicable services.

### How secure is my personal information?

Go Overseas has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.

### Privacy Policy Regarding Online Payments
