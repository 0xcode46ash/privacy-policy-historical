# Privacy Policy

### WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS

GoodSearch (including the GoodSearch Search Engine, GoodShop Mall and GoodPetitions), takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

#### How GoodSearch Uses Your Personal Information

This policy covers how GoodSearch treats personal information that GoodSearch collects and receives, including information related to your past use of GoodSearch products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

#### General

The GoodSearch Search Engine and GoodShop Mall do not require any personally identifying information.

GoodSearch collects limited non-personally identifying information and records information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, the date and time of your query, GoodSearch cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

Some of our services, including registering your nonprofit with GoodSearch and signing a petition on GoodPetitions may require you to provide personally indentifying information (typically your name, e-mail address, and mailing address).

When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.

### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

GoodSearch does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * You have signed a petition on GoodPetitions sponsored by one of our participating organizations. When signing a petition, you are often asked for information such as name, city, state, country, email and street address. This information is treated as public information and could be shared with the targets of the petitions such as members of Congress or the press. This information may be used to validate your signature. In addition, unless you have requested to be listed as "anonymous," the information (excluding your email and street address) will also be available on GoodPetitions.com. In addition, for the petitions listed on our site which are sponsored by one of our participating organizations, we give users the opportunity to receive email newsletters and/or other communication from the sponsoring organization. If you opt-in to participate in this, GoodPetitions will send the required contact information along to the 3rd party provider.
  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with GoodSearch under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help GoodSearch communicate with you about offers from GoodSearch and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GoodSearch's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if GoodSearch is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GoodSearch will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



GoodSearch displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteriaâ€”for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

  * GoodSearch does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
  * GoodSearch advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 



GoodSearch works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. 

### COOKIES

GoodSearch may set and access GoodSearch cookies on your computer.

GoodSearch lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to GoodSearch's cookies.

#### Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Nonprofit's Account Information and Your Email Preferences General

You can edit or delete your nonprofit's account information and your email preferences, at any time.

New categories of marketing communications might be added from time to time. Users can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. 

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the GoodSearch service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the GoodSearch Newsletter, that are considered part of your GoodSearch account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

### CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

GoodSearch may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your GoodSearch account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
