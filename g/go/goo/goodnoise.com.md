# Privacy Policy

**What Do We Do With All That Information?**

In the course of providing our products and services, we naturally accumulate some important information about our customers. The information is used primarily to process orders and to send announcements by email to those who expressly subscribe to selected announcement lists. We are, however, particularly sensitive to customer concerns about the use of this information. Many of our developers and staff have a long history in the privacy field -- the Chairman of our Board, our CEO, our vice president of Engineering, and others on our staff, all worked for Pretty Good Privacy, Inc (PGP), a leading encryption and privacy software firm. As such, we deeply respect your right to keep your information to yourself 

Accordingly, GoodNoise gives you the following pledges on what we'll do (and what we won't do) with this information: 

We will never give out your email address or home address to others without your express permission. (We hate spam at least as much as you do, probably more). 

We will never "rent" your personal information to another company. We will never send you email you don't request from us. (Possible exceptions to this include the automatic order confirmation we send you regarding your order and messages to notify you of any problem or delay regarding your order). 

We may give aggregate sales numbers to other organizations based on zip code (i.e., "Last month, zip code 90210 bought 37 copies of this album"). We will not give individual sales information out (not without a subpoena, anyway). 

Obviously, we'll use your ordering information to process your order. We will also use your email address to send announcements from announcement lists that you specifically subscribe to and to provide authentication on user-generated messages that we plan to offer on the site. If you any questions about this, please write to [privacy@goodnoise.com](mailto:privacy@goodnoise.com). 

**What About Cookies?**

We set a cookie in your browser (technically, two) to enable you to automatically login to GoodNoise. This falls within the original idea behind cookies, and as such is a "good" cookie. 

Not all cookies are good ones, however. Many organizations use cookies to assign your browser a unique ID number, which they use, without your knowledge or consent, to track your movements (albeit without knowing who you are, exactly) and target ads to you. For a rather hysterical explanation of this process, see [JunkBusters](http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/cookies.html). 

Be assured, however, that GoodNoise will not use cookies for the purposes of tracking your movements or generating target advertisements. The "good" cookies used by GoodNoise are only there to make your life easier, and frankly, to make the lives of our web developers a little easier. (Of course, certain advertisers on our web site, and operators of other web sites to which we may link, may use cookies for various advertising purposes. We cannot control this use, but please consider this as our disclosure to you of the possibility that these kinds of cookies may be at work in your browser. If you want to avoid them, please adjust your browser software accordingly -- check your browser help system or contact your browser supplier for further information).
