# Goodwood - Privacy Policy

The Goodwood group referred to in this policy as "we", "us" or "our", are pleased to provide information to all of our customers and sponsors about our online privacy policy. Please be assured that we use our best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this web site.

## Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used

We shall not ask you to supply any personal data as a condition of your use of this site. We will only ask for personal data if you choose to be registered as a “My Goodwood” registered user of the website or if you use our online ticketing services or shops, give your feedback on our web sites and our products or enter one of our online prize promotions, participate in any research or use a service provided through the site. We only gather personal information, such as first and last names, addresses and email addresses, Facebook profile name and Google user name, when voluntarily submitted by you.

**This information is collected to help us:**

  * fulfil your order
  * set permissions for your use of the website;
  * manage your registration preferences
  * send you renewal notifications and/or service notifications
  * identify all messages, posts or other interactive content you submit
  * personalise web content and advertising based on your personal characteristics or preferences
  * ensure, as far as is practical, that our websites and applications are compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors
  * conduct customer satisfaction surveys



**And, if you allow us to, we may also:**

  * tell you about additional products and services
  * send marketing information and news to you, for example, relating to our events, services or product offerings, loyalty schemes and clubs, gift cards, prize draws and other promotions and offers.
  * tell you about other promotional activities across the Goodwood Group of companies or Goodwood Partners (other companies with whom we have a business relationship)
  * invite you to participate in market research and surveys



**We also use your information for research and analysis. This helps us to:**

  * improve our understanding of customer needs
  * create marketing profiles
  * support strategic development



All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server.

## Sharing of Personal Information

We may share personal information within the Goodwood Group and with Goodwood Partners; by this expression, we mean Goodwood Estate Company Limited and each of its subsidiaries, together with certain selected companies with whom we have a commercial partnership.

Those selected companies are either our commercial partners, partners who perform a function such as prize-provision within our promotions and offers, or are agencies and suppliers whom we have retained to assist us to more effectively fulfil orders, manage and conduct promotions and offers, provide technical assistance and support and perform other functions to support our marketing activities.

In all cases, any use of your personal information by the Goodwood Group or with Goodwood Partner which has been instigated by us (as opposed, for example, to a promotional partner), will comply with this policy and with data protection legislation.  In every case, if you do not elect to receive such communications or if you elect to discontinue receiving them, then we will not send or will cease sending them to you.

Also, we reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfil your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement or regulatory investigation. Save for this, we do not sell, transfer or disclose personal information we have collected from you in connection with our web site activities, to third parties outside the Goodwood Group or Goodwood Partners.

Please note that if we are a promotional partner of an unrelated company, for example where we are not asking you to submit any personal information to us but are simply providing information on our site and maybe a link to the other company's website where one must visit to take part in that company's promotion, offer or other activity, then the privacy policy of that other company will apply instead of ours.

We may transfer the data that we collect from you to a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). By submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. 

Our website may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. Goodwood is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites and we recommend that you read the privacy policies on any external sites you use.

### Individuals under 16

The Goodwood Group does not intentionally or knowingly process personal information from individuals under the age of 16. When necessary, underage users will be told not to submit any personal details and we will make every effort to delete any details of such users where a parent or guardian has informed us that these details or applicable data as defined by law have been collected.
