**Overview**

This Privacy Policy applies to the [Google Book Search Copyright Settlement Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122313id_/http%3A//www.googlebooksettlement.com/index.html).

This website collects contact information you submit for the purpose of sending you an official Court-approved Notice of Class Action Settlement and other Settlement updates. Only [Rust Consulting](http://www.rustconsulting.com/), the Book Rights Registry, Class Counsel and Google (collectively, "we"), will have access to information collected by this website. The information collected will be held in strict confidence and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy for the purposes described below. 

At this time, we are not requesting any information related to your membership in the Settlement Class, your Settlement claim, or your interest in a [Book](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122313id_/http%3A//www.googlebooksettlement.com/definitions.html#books) or [Insert](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122313id_/http%3A//www.googlebooksettlement.com/definitions.html#inserts).

  * **Information you provide** – When you sign up to receive the Notice of Class Action Settlement and any further information on the Settlement, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and/or mailing address) so that we can send you the official Court-approved Notice of Class Action Settlement and update you on the Settlement if the Court gives its preliminary approval. When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our settlement administration services.
