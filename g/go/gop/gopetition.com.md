# Privacy Statement

**Understanding**  
Gopetition.com recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Petition signature information you provide us is not displayed anywhere publicly on the site, unlike other online petition hosting services. This means that your email address cannot be taken from our site and added to bulk mailing lists. The only people who have access to your personal information are the Gopetition.com staff and the author of the particular petition/s you have signed. 

We will not email you anything unrelated to Gopetition.com. If you choose not to be added to the mailing list, then your email will be stored securely and used only for petition signature verification and we will not email you ever.

As an author of a petition your email address will be displayed along with your petition. We feel if you are willing to stand up for a particular cause, you should not remain anonymous.

**Cookies**   
We use some cookies to remember who you are, this saves you typing in the same information repeatedly. You do not have to use cookies to use Gopetition.com

**Your information**  
Gopetition.com will not give or sell your information to any third party. You will not receive email or any other correspondance from any third party. We will send you information ONLY if it has been directly requested by you. 

When signing a petition, your information can be accessed by that petition author. This is necessary to validate the signature, and hence the petition.  

   


**Our commitment**  
Gopetition.com will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold about you. We will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.
