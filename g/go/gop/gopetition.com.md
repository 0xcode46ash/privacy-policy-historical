# Privacy Policy | GoPetition | Privacy Info for those writing or starting a petition or signing a petition

GoPetition - Privacy Statement

GoPetition recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. This privacy policy forms part or our Terms of Use (TOU) and is subject to and should be read with our TOU.  


**Your email address will NEVER be displayed on this website.**

We will not email you anything unrelated to GoPetition. If your email address is supplied, it will be stored securely.  If you are signing a petition, you may be sent a signature receipt by email that confirms that you have signed the petition. The receipt is for your records and provides information about how to edit and manage your signature. Your email address may be used for signature verification by GoPetition when we conduct quality control of a signature list. This is important to maintain high standards of signature list integrity. Quality signature lists promote quality petitions and successful campaigns.

Your information

GoPetition will not give or sell your information to any third party. If signing a petition, your information can be accessed by the petition's author. The author agrees to use signatures responsibly. Petition targets will also ultimately view relevant signature lists.   


Signature Display and Search Engine Access to Signature Lists

If you are signing a petition your signature may be publicly displayed in a signature list. Each petition at GoPetition has a public signature list that publicly displays at GoPetition all those who sign each petition. Our public lists do not include email or street addresses, but may include your town/city. 

The public lists give weight to each petition and confidence to other signers. Each author has the option to NOT display their list publicly. But you should assume that the author may display their list. If you choose our "Anonymous" designation feature, then your name will be cloaked publicly and will only be viewable to the author and target. You may also elect to hide your signature comment from public view if you only want the author or target to view your comment.

Please note that search engines such as Google and Yahoo may be able to view your signature and may index your signature. 

You may prevent indexing by cloaking your signature with an "Anonymous" designation. GoPetition members may now edit their signatures to encourage or hide from search engine exposure. For information about how to edit your signature please read our FAQ.Advertisements on GoPetition
