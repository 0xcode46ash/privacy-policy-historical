gopetition.com recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Petition signature information you provide us is not displayed anywhere publicly on the site, unlike other online petition hosting services. This means that your email address cannot be taken from our site and added to bulk mailing lists. The only people who have access to your personal information are gopetition.com staff and the author of the particular petition/s you have signed. The authors name and email address can be found at the bottom of each petitions information page. If you have any doubts about how the author will be using your information, then please feel free to email them directly.

When signing a petition you have the choice to be added to that particular categories mailing list. If you choose to be added to one of our mailing lists, then from time to time you will receive site updates. We will not email you anything unrelated to gopetition.com. Over our first 10 months of operation we sent out just three emails to subscribers. If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing lists, please [click here](http://www.gopetition.com/mlremove.php).

As an author of a petition your email address will be displayed along with your petition. We feel if you are willing to stand up for a particular cause, you should not remain anonymous.

You can choose to display your email address along with any message posted on our message boards. This will be YOUR choice. We have added this function so that people with similar views and opinions can contact each other for the greater good of their cause.
