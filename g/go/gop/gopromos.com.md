We collect customer information in an effort to improve our customer’s shopping experience. We will never misuse the information that you provide. We do not currently share any e-mail addresses with any outside vendors. We share your contact information with third party intermediaries - vendors, shipping companies and credit card companies - only to the extent necessary to fulfill your order with Curtis Rand Industries. These companies are used to process your orders and do not retain or use the information we provide to them for secondary purposes.

We occassionally share your mailing address with some carefully screened vendors whom we feel may provide products and services that will be of benefit to you. If you don't want us to share your mailing address please indicate so by selecting the "Do not share my mailing address" checkbox when you create your account. Alternatively you can send an email to [**feedback@gopromos.com**](mailto:feedback@gopromos.com) with "no third parties" in the subject line. 

From time-to-time we e-mail members of our mailing list with special promotions and offers. This will help you take advantage of savings on products that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails regarding promotions, just send an e-mail message to [**feedback@gopromos.com**](mailto:feedback@gopromos.com?Subject=Opt%20Out) and please type "opt out" in the subject line of your e-mail.

### _Is Your Information Secure?_

When sending sensitive information across the internet - including your login ID, password, and purchasing information such as credit cards - we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption provided by VeriSign. This software encrypts all information sent or received so that it cannot be intercepted and used by a foreign party.

Once your information is received, it is stored on a secure server, and access to your data is restricted to you and authorized personnel who process your orders and requests.

### _Company Security Policies_

Internally, all customer information is protected with multiple security checks. Each employee is granted access to our data with a username and password. Employee access to the system is limited to the functionality necessary for each person's job.

Our employee orientation program includes a discussion of data integrity and network security. Employees are informed of our security policies and their access to applications and data on our network.

The internet is a constantly evolving environment and we continuously add new content and functionality to our website. As such, we conduct reviews of our privacy and security policies and procedures regularly when changes are made to our site, when content is added, and when new applications are implemented.

### _How Can You Access or Change the Information GoPromos.com Keeps?_

When you log into your GoPromos account you are able to view your order history as well as your personal information. All personal information within your account is protected by the username and password you create. You have access to update your password as often as you wish. In addition, you can make changes to your billing name and address on-line. If you would like to make changes to information not available to you on-line, or if you have questions about your personal information you can call our customer service department at **1-888-246-7766** or e-mail us at [**feedback@gopromos.com**](mailto:feedback@gopromos.com).

### _Log Files_

GoPromos.com uses log files to track and analyze traffic on our web site. The data we collect is used to help us manage the site, analyze broad demographic information, track movement and application use on the site, improve performance and services, etc. None of the data we collect is directly linked to personally identifiable information.

We track the following information through our log files: IP address, browser type and version, operating system, date & time of your session, referring pages, and which pages are accessed on our site.

### _Does GoPromos.com Use Cookies?_

Cookies are small amounts of information that a web site can store on your computer to identify you as a user. GoPromos.com uses a temporary Cookie known as a session to identify you as a user on the site. No personally identifiable information is stored in the cookie, and the cookie is not retained on your computer after you leave GoPromos.com.

You may choose to refuse session-level cookies on your browser. Doing this will cause you to be unable to access some parts of the web site and will keep you from being able to make an online purchase on our site.

### _More About Security_

Shopping online with _GoPromos.com_ is safe and secure. We utilize Microsoft _Secure Socket Layers (SSL)_ technology to ensure the secure transfer of your personal and credit card information through encryption. When a secure connection is initiated, our server's public key is automatically transferred to your browser. Your browser then uses this key to encrypt information transferred back to _GoPromos.com_. This information can only be decrypted using the private key installed on _GoPromos.com's_ secure server.

Having a secure sever takes the risk out of your credit card transactions. We also do all order processing on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of anyone gaining access to your order information. We will keep your credit card information on file for future ordering convenience, but only if you want us to. 

If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please contact our customer service department at 1-888-246-7766 and we’ll be happy to help you with your order.
