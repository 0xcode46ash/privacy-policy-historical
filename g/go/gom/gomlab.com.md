# GOMlab Privacy Policy - Commitment to your privacy.

This policy covers Gretech treats personal information that Gretech collects and receives.  
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your SNS, email address, nickname or country, and that is not otherwise publicly available.  
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Gretech does not own or control or to people that Gretech does not employ or manage. 

This site is owned and operated by Gretech Corporation. Your privacy on the internet is of the utmost importance to us.  
At Gretech, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.  
This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.  


### Gretech gathers two three types of information about users

  * Information that needed for posting user's and comments in gomtv.net and sharing to user's selected social network services.  
That information includes your social network services and IP address.
  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to participate in our forums and to watch VOD/Live shows, and from participation in polls and surveys.
  * Information Gretech gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites.  
This information allows us to better tailor our content and service to users' needs and better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does Gretech divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.



### Discussion forums and VOD/Live service.

Users of the site's discussion forum and VOD/Live service must register for the service (free of charge) in order to post comments and watch videos, although they needn't register to visit the site.   
During registration the user is required to supply a username, country, password, and email address. 

  


## Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues.   
Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.  
Gretech may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question.   
This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 

  


## Surveys

Gretech may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.  
We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners.   
We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 

  


## Children

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. 

  


## Usage tracking

Gretech tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users.   
Gretech does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).   
Gretech sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.   
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

  


## Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.   
The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.   
A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Gretech uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).   
Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.   
If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.   
However, you do need cookies to watch VOD/Live shows and participate actively in discussion forums, polling and surveys. 

  


## USE OF INFORMATION

Gretech uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.   
As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to enable users to watch VOPD/Live shows and participate in polls, surveys, and discussion forums.  
When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.   
We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
