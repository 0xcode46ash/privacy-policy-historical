### When We Disclose Your Personal Information and Who We Disclose it to, Including Cross Border Disclosures

In line with modern business practices common to many financial institutions and to meet your specific needs we may disclose your personal information to the organisations described below.

The  _Corporations Act_  has provided the  ** _Australian Securities and Investments Commission_**  (" **ASIC** ") with the authority to inspect certain personal information that is kept on our files about you.

We collect information about you for the purpose of reporting to  **AUSTRAC**  under the  _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006_.

For the purposes set out above, we may disclose your personal information to organisations outside  **GO Markets**. The organisations to which we disclose information may include:

  * other product providers in order to manage or administer your product or service;
  * compliance consultants to ensure that our representatives are meeting our compliance standards; 
    * mailing houses;
    * your professional advisers, including your solicitor or accountant as authorised by you;
    * information technology service providers to maintain, review and develop our business systems, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems;


  * government and regulatory authorities and other organisations, as required or authorised by law, for example, to government or regulatory bodies for the purposes related to public health or safety, the prevention or detection of unlawful activities or to protect public revenue.
  * another authorised representative of  **GO Markets**  if necessary;
  * a potential purchaser/organisation involved in the proposed sale of our business for the purpose of due diligence, corporate re-organisation and transfer or all or part of the assets of our business.
  * where you have given your consent including your legal advisers;
  * a new owner of our business that will require the transfer of your personal information.



In addition, our employees and the outsourcing companies/contractors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by **  GO Markets**.

**GO Markets  **takes its obligations to protect your information seriously, this includes when we operate throughout Australia and overseas, as part of our operations some uses and disclosures of your information may occur outside your State or Territory and/or outside of Australia. In some circumstances we may need to obtain your consent before this occurs.

We may take reasonable steps to require that organisations both within and outside the  **GO Markets**  group of companies who handle or obtain personal information as service providers to us acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with either the Australian Privacy Principles or their local privacy regime and this policy.

Our ability to enforce the Australian Privacy Principles or any other contractual privacy obligation against overseas recipients and to take action in relation to any breach may be very limited and/or far less effective than it would be if such recipients were Australian based. As Australian Privacy Principles may not be enforceable against or apply to overseas regulation we understand that you may choose not to disclose your personal information to us. However, if you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.

In the event of that we propose to sell the business, we may disclose your personal information to potential purchasers for the purpose of them conducting due diligence investigations. Disclosure will be made in confidence and it will be a condition of that disclosure that no personal information will be used or disclosed by them.

### Solicited Personal Information

Without your consent we will not collect information about you that reveals your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations, membership of professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, details of health, disability, sexual orientation, or criminal record.

It is our policy that sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purposes for which it was provided, unless the customer agrees otherwise or the use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law, or when the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.

### How We Store and Secure Your Personal Information

We keep your personal information in your client file. These files are accessible to authorised personnel only and are appropriately secured out of hours.

Your personal information may also be held on our computer database. All computer-based information is protected through the use of access passwords. Data is backed up regularly and stored securely off site. Other measures taken are:

  * Confidentiality requirements for our employees
  * Security measures for systems access
  * Providing a discreet environment for confidential discussions



Personal information will be treated as confidential information and sensitive information will be treated highly confidential.

It is a legislative requirement that we keep all personal information and records for a period of 7 years. Should you cease to be a client of ours, we will maintain your personal information on or off site in a secure manner for 7 years. After this, the information will be destroyed.

### Ensure Your Personal Information is Correct and Up-to-Date

**GO Markets**  takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To ensure we can maintain this level of accuracy and completeness, we recommend that you:

We may use cookie technology as part of our websites statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience and to gather web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider's domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to our site. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page.) Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.

We also use standard web server log files to help us count visitors and evaluate our site's technical capacity. We use this information to find out how many people visit our site, help us arrange the pages in the most user-friendly way, keep the site browser-friendly, and to make our pages more useful to our visitors. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used.

### Spam Act

_Spam_  is a generic term used to describe electronic ‘junk mail’- unwanted messages sent to a person’s e-mail account or mobile phone. In Australia, spam is defined as ‘unsolicited commercial electronic messages’.

‘Electronic messaging’ covers e-mails, instant messaging, SMS and other mobile phone messaging, but not cover normal voice-to-voice communication by telephone.

**GO Markets**  complies with the provisions of the  _Spam Act_  when sending commercial electronic messages.

Equally importantly,  **GO Markets**  makes sure that our practices are in accordance with the National Privacy Principles in all activities where they deal with personal information. Personal information includes our clients contact details.

### 'Do Not Call' Register

Unless you ask us by calling  **1800 88 55 71**  not to contact you about products or services and not to disclose your information to others for that purpose, by accessing this website you consent to us contacting you by telephone while you hold any product or receive any services from us notwithstanding registration at any time of your telephone number on the ‘do not call’ register.

### Internal Procedure for Dealing with Communications

The three key steps  **GO Markets**  follows:

  * **Consent**  – Only commercial electronic messages are sent with the addressee’s consent – either express or inferred consent.
  * **Identify**  – Electronic messages will include clear and accurate information about the person and the company that is responsible for sending the commercial electronic message.
  * **Unsubscribe**  – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe facility is included in all our commercial electronic messages and deal with unsubscribe requests promptly.



### Consented to Such Communications

Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have given consent. This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is okay to send the message, or messages of that nature or inferred consent based on our business or other relationship with you and your conduct.

### Comply with the Law Regarding Viral Messages

**GO Markets**  ensures that Commercial Communications that include a Forwarding Facility contain a clear recommendation that the Recipient should only forward the Commercial Communication to persons with whom they have a relationship, where that relationship means that person could be said to have Consented to receiving Commercial Communications.

### Comply with the Age Sensitive Content of Commercial Communication

Where the content of a Commercial Communication seeks to promote or inspire interaction with a product, service or event that is age sensitive,  **GO Markets**  takes reasonable steps to ensure that such content is sent to Recipients who are legally entitled to use or participate in the product service or event.
