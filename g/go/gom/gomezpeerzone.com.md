# Privacy

**Information Collection and Use**  
Gomez, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Gomez, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website. Registration will be required to access certain portions of our website, but is not required to use this website. 

**Reward Programs**  
Participants in the Gomez PEER program may be eligible to participate in reward programs that allow users to earn money. Any such payments to users will be issued through a third-party payment fulfillment provider. Gomez's third-party payment fulfillment providers are PayPal, Monyebookers, and Alipay. To enable the providers to properly issue payments to users, Gomez will disclose the e-mail address of eligible users and the cash amount to be paid. Because this privacy policy only addresses the practices of Gomez, and because Gomez cannot govern the practices of third parties, we urge you to read the privacy policy of our third party providers.

**Referral Programs**  
When you sign up for a Gomez PEER account, you will have the ability to [refer your friends](https://web.archive.org/web/20111130091432id_/http%3A//www.gomezpeerzone.com/Refer.aspx) to the program. If people you refer subsequently join the Gomez PEER program, indicate you as the referrer, and meet the eligibility requirements, you will be eligible for a cash referral bonus. Please use our referral program responsibly.

**Cookies**  
Cookies may be used on this site to allow for movement between secure sections. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and/or customers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. For customers that order Gomez's peerReview service using a credit card, we must share the credit card information with a bank card merchant service provider (RBC Centura Bank), the appropriate credit card clearinghouse (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express), and an online payment processing service (VeriSign) in order to process the transaction. Gomez never stores or shares the credit card information with any other third parties.

**Links**  
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Gomez, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website. 

**Mailing List**   
If a user wishes to subscribe to our mailing list, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. From time to time, our site may request feedback from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Please see our "Choice/Opt-out" below. 

**Security**  
Gomez takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/login forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as account information), that information is encrypted and is protected with the most widely used encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.ssl.com](http://www.ssl.com/). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices and our service provider's offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our technical team or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, please visit our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111130091432id_/http%3A//www.gomezpeerzone.com/Contact.aspx) page. 

**Special Offers**  
We send all registered Gomez PEER users a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. We may occasionally send registered users information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**Administrative Updates**  
We also send administrative updates to registered Gomez PEER users, and customers of Gomez's peerReview service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail. Members are not able to unsubscribe from administrative updates, which contain important information about the service. Administrative update e-mails will include information such as important software and site upgrades, system status information and scheduled downtime. Administrative update e-mails do not contain advertising information. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. Gomez PEER users can change their account password and e-mail address, ZIP code and country through the Gomez PEER Custom Homepage. This page is accessible via the "Gomez PEERs" section of the Web site after logging in with username and password. If a user no longer desires our service, they can unsubscribe from the Gomez PEER program by visiting our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111130091432id_/http%3A//www.gomezpeerzone.com/Contact.aspx) page. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
If information will be used for purposes not directly related to our site, our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out.' Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by visiting our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111130091432id_/http%3A//www.gomezpeerzone.com/Contact.aspx) page. Gomez PEER users can also opt-out of newsletters and leaderboards through the Gomez PEER Custom Homepage. This page is accessible via the "Gomez Peers" section of the Web site after logging in with username and password. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post changes on our homepage so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Gomez may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website.
