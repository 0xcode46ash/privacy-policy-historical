# Advertising.com :: Company Info

**ADVERTISING.COM COMPANY PRACTICES**

The following statement describes the overall company practices of Advertising.com, including advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by Advertising.com. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ADVERTISING.COM**

**Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data**

Advertising.com delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the thousands of web sites that are a part of Advertising.com's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we collect what is known as "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us. We use different types of technologies to collect this type of information. (Please refer to the FAQ section for more details). 

In addition to the Click Stream Data collected across our network, Advertising.com owns numerous web sites and services, and collects information at those sites. Among the sites and services that Advertising.com owns are [www.InYourEmail.com](http://www.inyouremail.com/) and [www.NetEzines.com](http://www.netezines.com/). (For a more complete list, see the FAQ section below). As a part of the registration process at these sites, we may request and collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual. Web surfers may elect not to provide Click Stream Data by following the opt-out procedures set forth below. Personally-identifiable information that is collected at these sites is discussed immediately below. 

**Personally-Identifiable Consumer Data**

At some of the sites owned and operated by Advertising.com, we ask people to register and provide personally-identifiable data. Advertising.com is committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all consumers before the personally-identifiable data is collected, and that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally-identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and e-mail address. 

**Other Information That Is Collected**

At some sites, including this one, Advertising.com collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with Advertising.com ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of Advertising.com's network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third-parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate. 

**HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED**

The non-personally identifiable data that Advertising.com collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. 

If a consumer elects to provide Advertising.com with personally-identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other Advertising.com sales and marketing efforts. Advertising.com does not use any personally-identifiable information about individuals for targeting or tracking purposes without first receiving the person's consent. Indeed, such consent is obtained before any personally-identifiable data is collected. Our goal in using this data is to provide a more personally significant internet experience for the individual. 

**SHARING WITH THIRD-PARTIES**

All personally-identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in strict confidence by Advertising.com and will be treated with the same level of respect and care that Advertising.com treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets. There are instances, however, in which personally-identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third-parties, as described below. 

The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Advertising.com on an anonymous basis (e.g., broad demographic information relating to Click Stream Data). 

With respect to personally-identifiable information, Advertising.com may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing an Advertising.com product or service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with Advertising.com upon terms and conditions consistent with the policies set forth herein. 

Advertising.com may also share personally-identifiable information with third-parties who enter into business relationships with us. For example, we may co-brand or co-sponsor a newsletter with another company, and that company will have access to the information. We may also disclose information to a third-party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Advertising.com is very careful about which companies it does business with. 

In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that Advertising.com, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information. 

Finally, Advertising.com may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply and cooperate with government and law enforcement officials. 

**SECURITY PRECAUTIONS**

Advertising.com makes every effort to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. We use state-of-the-art technology, including encryption, to ensure the highest security standards. Any data that is stored on Advertising.com's servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. Advertising.com has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering Advertising.com products and services. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use industry standards to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist. 

**CONSUMER CHOICE**

**Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data - Use of Cookies & Opting-Out**

Advertising.com uses technology, including cookies and 1x1 pixels, to deliver better, targeted marketing messages to the web surfer. These tools are used to collect anonymous data, and in some instances where personally-identifiable information has been provided by a user, to provide better and more relevant services and messages to that user. We believe that the use of such tools assists in providing a more meaningful web surfing experience, but you may opt-out of their use if you would like. To do so, you can either disable cookies on your browser, or go to the opt-out section at this site. (For more information on cookies, please refer to the FAQ section). 

**Personally Identifiable Consumer Data - Opt-Out**

If a consumer elects to provide Advertising.com with personally-identifiable data, he or she may "opt-out" of such election at any time. Simply email us at [support@advertising.com](mailto:support@advertising.com) and provide the name of the service (such as [www.NetEzines.com](http://www.netezines.com/), [www.InYourEmail.com](http://www.inyouremail.com/), [www.Adbroadcast.com](http://www.adbroadcast.com/), etc.) for which you provided information, and we will promptly remove the data. 

**Access To Data**

Advertising.com allows consumers who have voluntarily provided personally-identifiable data, access to their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes. Please contact us at support@advertising.com. 

**MISCELLANEOUS**

**Children's Privacy**

Advertising.com is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children surfing the web. Advertising.com's web sites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.
