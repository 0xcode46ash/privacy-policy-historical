# Godchecker Mythology FAQ : Common questions: ' Privacy Policy..?'

## Like all right-thinking people, we at Godchecker are pro-privacy and anti-spam.

  


## Cookies

Like most websites, we use cookies. But we use them only to help bits of the site work better. For example, the drop-down A-Z list of Gods uses a little cookie to remember which letter you last clicked on. It makes the site a little easier to use, that's all. **No personally identifiable information is stored at any time.**

We only use temporary session cookies which your browser deletes when you close it. You can easily disable cookies (consult your browser documentation) and the site will work fine. It just won't be quite so user-friendly. 

Any advertisements on this site served by Google, Inc and affiliated companies may use cookies. These cookies allow Google to display ads based on your visits to this site and other sites that use Google advertising services. You can learn more about this cookie usage including how to opt-out by visiting [www.google.com/privacy/ads](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/)

## Site stats

**We do not collect any personally identifiable information from visitors.** Like most websites, our server does log boring things such as the time, date, IP address and pages visited - but this info is only used to compile general site statistics (such as the number of people visiting per day and so on). 

## Email policy

If you contact us, all information you provide (such as name or email address) will be treated confidentially. We promise to respect your privacy and never reveal your email address to any third party or burn your house down without asking. We are protected against all known forms of virus, spyware, trojan, worm and splim by RAGNORAK SECURITY, a division of Loki Enterprises. 

We do have a mailing list which we sometimes use to let people know about updates and new stuff. We absolutely will not bombard your inbox every time we blow our noses. We use Mailchimp to handle our mailing list, one of the net's most respected email providers. If you write to us via our opt-in form, we may add you to the list. Please be assured that you can change your details or unsubscribe at any time.
