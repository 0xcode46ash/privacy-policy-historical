# Privacy Policy | goregrish.com

Welcome to GoreGrish, our little corner of the internet filled with horror & lulz. View our hosted articles and video or head to [**the forum**](http://forum.goregrish.com/) and register for access to our ever growing community with its 20,000+ forum attachments for your viewing. It's free and fast. We encourage you to [**register**](http://forum.goregrish.com/login/login) and do away with annoying reminder messages like this, if you are under 18 years old though, we suggest you [**fuck off**](http://www.pokemon.com/).

We take the privacy of our visitors very seriously. While we do use Analytics to collect aggregate information on unique visits, pageviews, etc; this information is used to analyze overall traffic patterns only.

Visitors who submit information via our Contact or Registration forms will have their emails and IP addresses recorded; the former is so that we may reply to them if they have a question or comment, and the latter is to prevent spam & abuse. To maximize privacy, we make a policy of scrubbing these forms clean of data on a regular basis, except of course, the user IP ban list we maintain on the server level.

We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.
