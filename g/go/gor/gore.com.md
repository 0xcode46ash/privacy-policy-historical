# Gore Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: 8/5/2009 ([view archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20120628143857id_/http%3A//www.gore.com/en_xx/footer/privacy_2004.html) )_

W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (referred to below as 'Gore') respects your privacy. The only personally identifiable information Gore collects about you is what you provide to Gore, for example by completing a Gore “contact us” form, participating in a Gore contest or by some other interactive channel.

## Information Collection, Use and Disclosure

Gore collects personally identifiable information, such as email address, name, mailing address, phone number and birthday, only if individual Web site visitors wish to give Gore this information. Gore uses personally identifiable information to improve its product offerings, analyze Web site usage, improve and customize its Web sites, and for general customer relationship and service purposes, such as responding to a question about a product.

As part of Gore’s normal business operations, Gore may share a user’s personally identifiable information with certain third-party service providers. For example, Gore discloses personally identifiable information to third parties when it is reasonably necessary in order to enable Gore to provide services that have been requested by users, to provide information that has been requested by users or to provide products that have been ordered by users. Additionally, some of Gore’s Web site operations, product fulfillment operations, marketing programs, data processing and data analysis may be managed and/or conducted by Gore’s affiliates and/or third-party service providers. Gore may provide access to your profile and personally identifiable information to such affiliates and/or third-party service providers for the purpose of providing services to you on behalf of Gore or to enable such affiliates and service providers to provide services to Gore.

Gore can (and you authorize Gore to) disclose any information about you as required by law, including voluntary disclosures to law enforcement agencies and government officials, as Gore, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate.

Gore may also disclose or use personally identifiable information to investigate and respond to any third party complaints or violations of Gore’s rights.

Gore also collects aggregate statistical information regarding general Web site traffic patterns. In order to do so, Gore's Web site uses cookies. Gore also uses third-party service providers to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from Web site users.

## Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes or if you no longer desire to receive any of Gore’s services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your information by contacting Gore using our Contact Us form.

## Choice/Opt-Out

If you provide Gore with your email address or mailing address, Gore may send you newsletters, information on products, services and promotions or offer you the opportunity to participate in Gore marketing and promotions, such as surveys or contests. With respect to any such emails, within the emails Gore will provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for such purposes by the Gore division that sent the email.

## Governing Law and Data Storage

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the United States of America, which is where this Web site is hosted.

By providing any personal information to Gore through this Web site, all users, including without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the submission, collection and processing of such information in the United States of America. Some of Gore’s Web sites are targeted towards countries other than the United States and are intended for visitors from those countries. If you are a resident of a country other than the United States and you give Gore personal information through a Gore Web site targeted towards your country of residence, that information will be stored and used in accordance with the laws of the country in which the Web site is maintained.

## Transfer of Information

In the event Gore or one of its divisions is ever sold to or acquired by another company, Gore reserves the right to transfer ownership of the customer information to the acquiring company.
