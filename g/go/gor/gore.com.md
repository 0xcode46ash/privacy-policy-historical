# Privacy Statement

W. L. Gore & Associates (Gore) respects your privacy. The only information that we collect about you is that which you choose to submit to us, either through a product registration form, by placing an order, submitting a resume or through other interactive forms. We will always give you an opportunity to decline to receive further information.

**General visitors to Gore's product Web sites -** Gore collects personal information, such as e-mail addresses, names or mailing addresses only when individual web site visitors choose to submit such information to us. Aggregate statistics are gathered on general web site traffic patterns.

**Purchases from the Gore Online Store -** When you purchase goods online from Gore at http://www.gore.com/store, we must collect a shipping and billing name, address, and credit card information to process your order. That information is accepted using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer encryption to ensure credit card and order information security. Your order is processed in Elkton, Maryland by a Gore Customer Service associate. Purchasers of products from the Gore Online Store have the choice whether to receive or refuse e-mail or regular mail information from Gore on product care, product updates and other promotional information.

**Warranty Registrations -** When you purchase GORE-TEX® fabric products, ELIXIR® guitar strings or RIDE-ON® bicycle cables, Gore offers product warranties. We gather the names, addresses, and demographic information of customers who choose to register their product purchase, either on-line or by mailing in the registration card. These customers may receive promotional mailings, product updates, and product care information. Their information may also be used for market research. Warranty registrants always have the option to decline to have their information used for promotional or research purposes by checking the appropriate box on the registration form.
