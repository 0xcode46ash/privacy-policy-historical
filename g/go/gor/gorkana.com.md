#### 12\. PHISHING EMAILS

"Phishing emails" may circulate the Internet in the name of Gorkana which link to fake websites made to look like our website. These messages are not sent by Gorkana. Gorkana will never send you an email requesting your bank details, login or password, or asking you to make a payment into a bank account. If you have received a message requesting this information or with instructions to pay money into a bank account, please ignore it.

Key safety tips:

Be careful accessing Gorkana's site through links contained in e-mails. The address that should appear on your web browser should always start with www.gorkana.com. Fraudsters may provide a link to a bogus site to trick you to disclose your personal information.

Watch out for SPAM emails with attachments. SPAM emails can be made to look as though they come from a safe source or a friend's email address, however, once you open the attachment they can download a virus on to your computer. Be wary of suspicious looking attachments as even friends can unwittingly send you a virus by email.

#### 13\. MEDIA DATABASE

13.1 Gorkana takes great pride in the extent and accuracy of its database of media contacts – journalists, bloggers and media outlets – which we call the Media Database. The information we maintain in our Media Database, and how that information is used, depends on the information that has been provided to us, how we obtained that information, and how the media contact uses our services. This section describes what personal information we obtain about the media contacts on our Media Database and how that information is used. This section should be read in conjunction with the rest of this privacy policy which may also apply media contacts. 

  * What additional information do we collect about journalists on our Media Database? 



13.2 In addition to the information referred to at 2.1 above, we may collect additional information about our media contacts which may include information such as your job title, contact information (including mobile phone number and personal email if you provide it to us), career history, beat, articles that you have written, personal interests and other information that may enhance the service that we provide for you and for our corporate subscribers.

  * How do we obtain information about journalists that is stored in the Media Database? 



13.3 In addition to the sources of information set out in section 2.1 above, the information we hold in relation to journalists on our Media Database comes from a variety of sources, including, in particular:

a) information provided to us direct by journalists (for example, when signing up for one of our services, such as Media Alerts, or when responding to a request for information from Gorkana);

b) from media outlets (newspapers, magazines etc), who will periodically provide information relating to journalists employed by or connected with them (e.g. current job titles, contact information, areas of interest);

c) from publicly available sources (such as news stories, press releases, online media);

d) from other third party sources (for example, information provided by Gorkana’s customers or from other journalists).

  * How the Media Database is used



13.4 In addition to the general uses in section 4.1, information about our journalists that is contained in the Media Database may be made available to our corporate subscribers who use our products and services. For example, Gorkana’s corporate PR customers that subscribe to our Media Database & Alerts service will have access to information about journalists (including their contact information) that we hold in the Media Database, and will be sent alerts providing information about changes to the database (for example, changes in job titles, journalist moves, and contact information). Our corporate customers may contact journalists direct (using the contact information we keep in the Media Database) to, for example, send press releases or other PR material which our customers may consider will be of interest to the journalist in question. Gorkana does not control and is not responsible for the content of any such communications.

  * Maintaining the Media Database



13.5 Gorkana prides itself in maintaining up to date and accurate data on the Media Database. We will update our records as soon as possible after receiving information that requires changes to our database. Such information may come to us from any of the sources referred to above. We may also receive information from other sources, for example, out of office messages. Where appropriate, we will notify the journalist of substantive changes, and may choose not to make any changes until they have been approved by the journalist.

13.6 As a journalist you will always have the opportunity to review and request changes to the information we hold about you. 

13.7 If you no longer wish to be on the Media Database we will remove you from it. You may still receive other services (e.g. Media Alerts) even if you are no longer on the Media Database.

13.8 If, at any time, you wish to be removed from the Media Database, or if you would like to review your profile, please email us at [privacy@gorkana.com](mailto:privacy@gorkana.com).

#### 14\. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY/ CONTACT POINTS

14.1 Any changes that we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email.

14.2 If you have any questions or concerns about how Gorkana handles your personal information, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [privacy@gorkana.com](mailto:privacy@gorkana.com).
