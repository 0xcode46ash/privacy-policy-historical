# Gotcast.com: Privacy

_Last Updated: October 1, 2007_

The privacy of GotCast users and their information is extremely important to us and we take this matter very seriously. All users of GotCast are covered by the following Privacy Policy. GotCast reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy. If required to do so, or it is in our best interest, GotCast may release user information in compliance with law enforcement agencies. 

In order to secure your personal information, all communications between you and the GotCast website are secured. Furthermore, your personal information cannot be accessed by other users. Therefore, other users will never be able to see this private information unless you provide it to them deliberately. 

GotCast is an online service that allows its members to connect and interact with one another. Users are represented on the site with personal profiles. You choose the information in your profile and therefore control what can be seen by other users. GotCast must collect certain pieces of information in the normal course of its business and GotCast retains the ownership rights to this information including text and all media formats. 

There are several primary types of information that are collected including Contact, Profile, and Internet information. Credit Card information may also be accepted for membership fees and other services. GotCast is in no way limited to the collection of only this type of information and may deem it necessary to collect other data. You will be notified if any changes are made to this policy via a posting on this website. 

Upon registering as a GotCast user, certain contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address may be collected. This serves as an example and is not intended to be a complete list of information that may be collected at registration. 

Following registration, GotCast users will be prompted to complete a profile. Current users can also make changes to their own user profile. A user profile may contain, but is not limited to, your name, a personal statement, your photo, your video, and other information that may be used in a casting or other contact proposal. You should use good judgment about the information that you post in your profile since this can be viewed by others on the GotCast. Your personal contact information CANNOT be viewed unless you release this information. Additionally, the information in your profile can be edited at your discretion at any time. 

As part of our efforts to provide better services to GotCast users, GotCast collects certain information related to the Internet and your computer. In order for us to analyze trends and provide superior service to our users, GotCast retrieves the web address (URL) of both the website that you visited directly before and directly after visiting the GotCast site. We also receive certain other information about your personal computer such as the unique IP address. GotCast also follows a standard practice of using cookies and logs to analyze website usage. Cookies are extremely small files that are stored on your computer and help us to provide you with a better experience by automatically recalling your preferences each time you visit our site. Cookies will not harm your computer in any way and can be deleted at any time. 

You may make changes to your GotCast account and any associated preferences at any time. To make changes, you must log onto the GotCast and make any edits through the Account section. You may also request to terminate your GotCast account. To request a removal of your account, please contact us at [support@gotcast.com](mailto:support@gotcast.com). 

As part of the normal functioning of GotCast, users may receive email requests from GotCast or for contact from other users. However, GotCast will NOT reveal your email address to any other user until you chose to do so. Additionally, GotCast will send you system generated emails and promotional materials. These communications may begin during the registration process and continue while your account remains with GotCast. If you wish to opt out of promotional emails, you may do so in your account area once you login. 

We will not release your personal information to any party unless required to do so by law or if it is requested by you or part of the normal functioning of GotCast. We do intend to use a third party to verify and process credit card information for any fees or purchases made on GotCast or with GotCast. All third parties are required to use your information in a secure manner and only for the purpose given to them and cannot store or release this information. Certain non-sensitive profile information may be released to our affiliates and partners for the purpose of marketing and improving our service to you.
