# GotVMail - Privacy Policy

## Information Collection

GotVMail Communications is the sole owner of the information collected on www.GotVMail.com. GotVMail Communications collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

## Order

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

## Information Use

Information collected is used only for setting up service and conveying information about user accounts and upcoming features and benefits of GotVMail programs. 

## Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  We do not share your profile with other third parties.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  We use cookies on this site.

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called "analog 4.13" that uses log files to analyze user movement.

_**Communications from the Site**_

## Special Offers and Updates

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

##  Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

## Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature.   

## Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

_**Sharing**_

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

##  Third Party Advertisers

GotVMail Communications DOES NOT share Web site usage information about users with a reputable third party. GotVMail may share general customer information but never call records or usage statistics to partners who have signed a non-disclosure agreement for the sole purpose of establishing a partnership agreement. This data may include customer name and address.

## Service Providers

We do not partner with other third party Systems to provide toll free services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or all contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

##  Business Transitions

In the event GotVMail Communications goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

## Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, GotVMail Communications, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

## Refer an Entrepreneur

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing an entrepreneur or friend about our site, we ask them for the entrepreneur’s or friend’s name and email address.  GotVMail Communications will automatically send the entrepreneur or friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  GotVMail Communications  does not store this information; it is used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  The friend may contact GotVMail Communications by [submitting a ticket](http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&_a=submit) to request the removal of this information from our database. 

## Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

## Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can [submit a ticket](http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&_a=submit) to our Customer Support Center. 

## Supplementation of Information 

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

##  Address Verification

We use Authorize.net to verify a user’s address for credit card authentication purposes. 

##  Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by [submitting a ticket](http://support.gotvmail.net/index.php?_m=tickets&_a=submit) to our Customer Support Center.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
