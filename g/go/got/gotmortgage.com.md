> 
> Secure web pages. All of the pages on our website that ask for your personal information are delivered to your browser through HTTPS, a secure server communications layer. To verify the security of a page, look for the “lock” (in Internet Explorer) or “key” icon (in Netscape) on your browser. 
> 
> Encryption technology. When you send your personal financial information to Gotmortgage.com, it is protected by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) system. SSL prevents anyone from intercepting or reading your personal information by encrypting, or translating, the data into a string of gibberish characters. Only we can decode the encryption.

> 
> Password protection. To obtain any information about your loan status, you are required to enter a username and password. This procedure is in place to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your account and personal information.

Unless you specifically tell us who you are (for example by completing an application), if you are just browsing our site, we will never know who you are even though we assign you a cookie.
