To register, we will ask for contact information (job seekers and employers) and information on your company (employers). GotoGulf.com is the sole owner of information collected on the registration pages and we will not disclose this information to anyone outside of GotoGulf.com. Your contact information (such as name and email address) may however be used to contact you about any features/services on our site and partner sites which we believe may be of interest.

Employers are asked to submit detailed information about the position requirements as part of their job posting activity. Information is submitted purely voluntarily. Job details may be viewed by any registered job seeker members. Non-members may view position but do not have access to apply; they must register first to be able to contact your company.

You may change/modify/delete any information you provide at any point in time.
