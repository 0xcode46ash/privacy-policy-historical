**Safe Shopping Guarantee**  
We understand that you may have concerns about using your credit card to make purchases online, and we pledge to keep this information secure. By utilizing Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption technology, we are able to keep your personal information safe.

All of your Ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number \-- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our Ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, after we receive your credit card information, we store it on a server that is not accessible by the Internet. Keep in mind, though, that in the unfortunate event that you are subject to fraudulent charges, you should first notify your credit card provider as stated in their reporting rules and guidelines.

**Gohastings Privacy Policy**  
To provide you with the best service and products available, we need to collect information that distinguishes you from each of our other users. We collect this information in two ways. 

  * **Registration:** When you register with gohastings.com and log in, you provide us with information like your name, address, and e-mail address. This information is used for personalization, verification, shipping, and to make it easy for you to log in.
  * **Cookies:** Another way we collect information that distinguishes your visit to our site is to give you a "cookie" when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Gohastings.com uses cookies to make visiting our site easier for you. Leaving cookies on your computer allows us to save your passwords and preferences for you so that you won't have to re-enter them every time you visit our site. Another function of cookies is to temporarily store information while you are still at this site. The information they store includes quantities ordered, types of gift wrapping desired, messages to be sent with a gift, and a special address to which a gift is shipped. These temporary cookies expire when you close your browser.

The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie or to refuse to accept any cookies. You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.

  * **Notification of Change to Privacy Policy:** Material changes to above mentioned privacy policy will be sent to subscribed members of gohastings.com via email as well as posted in this section. It is good practice to check periodically to ensure you are aware of any changes to the Privacy Policy in case an email was overlooked or inadvertently deleted.

You may always decline to receive these offers by unchecking this option during the registration process. In the event that you longer wish to receive the gohastings.com mailings, the option to unsubscribe will always be located in the newsletter.

**Your Bill of Rights**  
When browsing and purchasing from gohastings.com, you have certain inalienable rights. Hastings Internet, Inc. owns and operates gohastings.com , and wishes all users to know and understand these rights when purchasing from this website. First, you have the right to the privacy of any personal information you enter on this site. Gohastings.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to any third party, unless legally required to do so or under your consent. Gohastings.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information. Second, while you shop at gohastings.com, you will never have to worry about credit card safety. 

We guarantee that every transaction you make at this site will be 100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at gohastings.com. In the unfortunate event that you lose a credit card and are subject to fraudulent charges, remember to first notify your credit card provider, as stated in their reporting rules and guidelines. In general, under federal law (the Fair Credit Billing Act), you will never be liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If, for whatever reason, you are held responsible for this amount, gohastings.com will cover the liability for you, up to $50, as long as the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own, from purchases made from gohastings.com while using our secure server. Third, regarding shipping charges when you are returning misshipped products, Hastings Internet, Inc. will assume responsibility if, through our mistake, we shipped a wrong or defective product to you. However, if you ordered a product item thinking it was something different, and gohastings.com sends it to you in good faith, you will be responsible for the shipping costs of returning it.
