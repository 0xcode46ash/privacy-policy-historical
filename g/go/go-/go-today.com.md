# Go-today Vacation Packages & Travel Deals Security

Last update: September 29, 2011

Go-today protects your personal information and will not sell your information to a third party. It is intended solely for the purpose of sending periodic announcements of our latest offerings. 

Your privacy is very important to us at go-today. It is one of our priorities to always protect our customers' personal information. You can be confident that your use of this site is done so anonymously, until you provide personal information to us when booking travel products online. We keep our customers' personal information safe and never provide it to third parties for marketing purposes. 

**What personal info do we gather?**  
Information You Give Us: When you purchase travel products from our web site we will keep your records on file to better serve you. 

E-mail Communications: We do not provide email addresses to third parties for marketing or any other activity. We use your email address to confirm your booking details and to periodically notify you of our latest offerings. 

**Do we share personal information?**  
We do not provide any personal information about our customers to third parties for marketing purposes. We do share information about you to other companies that provide services to you on our behalf. These companies include the below: 

Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

Business Partners: Go-today operates several other travel companies, which include go-today.com, Brian Moore International Tours (BMIT) and customer information is pooled into a unified database. This global list comes with shared opt-in and opt-out privileges for our customers and obligates us to strict record maintenance under the CAN-SPAM act. Customer information is shared between these business entities in an effort to streamline our customer service efforts and provide maximum travel benefits to our customers. 

Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might merger brands together, sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that go-today or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

Protection of go-today and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of go-today, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

**Do we use cookies?**  
Cookies are very small text files that your web browser manages for you. We have kept the use of cookies to a minimum, but when they are used on this website, they are only used for anonymous tracking. You will remain anonymous until you choose to provide us with personal information, such as when booking travel products or saving travel options on this website. 

**Do we use encryption to protect data transmissions?**   
We use secure SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect data that is sent to us by our customers. You can be sure that when making a booking your personal information is protected as it is sent to us. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**  
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time to respond to changes in the law or in our business practices. All users of this website agree to this Privacy Policy and are bound by it. If you would like to comment on any aspect of this Privacy Policy, please [email us](https://web.archive.org/web/20120604184350id_/http%3A//www.go-today.com/email.aspx?e=general).

 **Online Security**

**Why is go-today so safe?**  
At go-today we use Secure Server Software (SSL) which is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. SSL encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. 

**We guarantee that your transaction with go-today will be 100% safe. You pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of buying online at go-today.**

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, go-today will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will cover this liability only if, while buying online at go-today using our secure server, the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
