Online Privacy Policy

GolfBallsDirect.com will not disclose personal information to third parties without the user's permission, except as provided in this policy, and will take appropriate measures to safeguard the personal information shared with us. 

When GolfBallsDirect.com requests sensitive information, commercially reasonable steps will be taken to establish a secure connection with the user's web browser to assure privacy.

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor accesses any site powered by GolfBallsDirect.com, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate and to monitor fraudulent attempts at accessing the site but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals.

At times users are asked to provide personal information to obtain a specific product or service. This information may include a user's name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, credit card information and e-mail address. For security reasons your card number is never displayed in full once you have entered it. Only the last four digits are displayed to confirm your order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

GolfBallsDirect.com collects personal information to provide you with the most personalized online service. Your e-mail address will be used to receive order details, account status, and other similar e-mail information. GolfBallsDirect.com values its customers' privacy and thus will disclose customer-specific information only if required by law.
