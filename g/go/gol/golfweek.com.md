_Information about your computer hardware and software_  
For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address. The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from us, such as an article or a form for posting to a discussion board.

We collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form. We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit.

We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, and record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
