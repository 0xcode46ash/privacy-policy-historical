# Goldsmiths Privacy Policy

  


At Goldsmiths, our commitment to exceptional customer service and value means we respect and protect the privacy of our customers. To help us provide the best possible service, we may collect and maintain certain information regarding, for example, the products you purchase, and your billing and delivery information. However, we protect and enforce the confidentiality of this information very strictly, and under no circumstances will we sell or rent it to other businesses or third parties. We respect your privacy and do all we can to honour the trust you place in Goldsmiths.

We currently only send emails to customers who have asked us to send them information about our products and services. If you have asked for such emails in the past, but have now changed your mind, just email us and let us know and we will remove your details from our emailing list.
