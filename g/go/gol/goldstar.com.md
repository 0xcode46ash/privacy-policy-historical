### User Data Supplementation

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.  This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.  If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include:

  * Address information about you from third party sources, such as the U.S. Postal Service, to verify your address so we can properly ship your order to you and to prevent fraud.

### How We Use Contact Information

Specifically, we disclose your name or the name of the gift recipients. In addition, we may disclose your or a gift recipient's contact information, include email address, to service providers, such as payment processors, that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf, including completing transactions that you initiate through the Site. We may also disclose other personal information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for accessible or ADA seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone number to the venue or event promoter to notify you of last minute changes that will affect your purchase. Examples of this might include cancellations and postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail, your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information and/or demographic information will not be disclosed. Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the shipping address. For some purchases, we may require additional permission from you to disclose other personal information such as your email address.

Venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events are specifically prohibited from using personal information provided to them for any purpose other than fulfilling your purchase or admission or for analytics purposes, unless you specifically opt-in and authorize other uses.

We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from Goldstar. We carefully select the information we send in an effort to provide you information that offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. You may opt-out of all special event notifications by editing your [email subscription](https://web.archive.org/account/edit).

### How We Use Feedback and Ratings

If you buy tickets to an event on the Site, we may solicit you by email for your feedback on the experience. Feedback may include ratings, reviews, names, taglines and/or photos. If you choose to give us feedback and you make your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Site in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review as part of the "Roar of the Crowd" email along with your member profile name. If you choose not to make your feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and producers.

We strongly discourage you from disclosing any personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback, especially if you've chosen to make it public. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will be able to see this information. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this information but they are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages. From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Site. For example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain your consent. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us).
