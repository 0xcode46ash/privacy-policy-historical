You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on the Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personally identifiable information.

### Your IP Address

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about our members. Your IP address is recorded when joining and making purchases. This enables us to detect and prevent fraudulent activity.

### Cookies

Cookies are small amounts of data stored on your computer. The Site uses cookies to "remember" you once you've logged in so that you are not repeatedly asked to log in. This cookie is associated with your account and your personal information. The Site also uses cookies to record referral information.

Additionally, various third parties who refer potential new members to the Site may set cookies on their own Web site before linking to us. These third parties may also read cookies on the Site to track purchases and join referrals that these third parties are responsible for.

### Web Beacons and Unique URLs

We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails are opened by recipients. Additionally, links in emails may be unique to let us know which emails are clicked on. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

### Behavioral Targeting/ Re-Targeting

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may [opt-out](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

### Social Media Widgets

These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, andÂ may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Information We Request Directly From You

The Site's registration forms, order forms, contact us forms, surveys and contests may require you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address), unique identifiers (such as a username and password), and demographic information (such as your ZIP code or age). Order forms require financial information (such as your account or credit card numbers and billing address) as well. You may be asked to provide a shipping address if the tickets you purchase will be delivered by mail.

In the case your purchase is a gift for another person, we may require and collect that person's third party personal information and share such information with vendors and service providers providing services on behalf of Goldstar. Specifically, we may provide the gift recipient's name and/or phone number to the venue or event promoter. If the tickets are mailed, we require the recipient's shipping address. This information will only be used to complete fulfillment of the gift. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary to provide_ these services to us.

We will ask you for your friend's name and email address, when you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Goldstar Events Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your friend may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us) to request that we remove this information from our database.

### How We Use Contact Information

Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site. A limited amount of personal information is provided to the venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events for which you purchase tickets. Specifically, we disclose your name or the name of the gift recipients. We may also disclose other personal information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for handicap seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone number to the venue or event promoter to notify you of last minute changes that will affect your purchase. Examples of this might include cancellations and postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail, your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information and/or demographic information will not be disclosed. Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the shipping address. For some purchases, we may require additional permission from you to disclose other personal information such as your email address. A notice of what personal information and how it will be used will appear during the checkout process. Venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events are specifically prohibited from using personal information provided to them for any purpose other than fulfilling your purchase or admission, unless you specifically opt-in and authorize other uses.

We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from Goldstar. We carefully select the information we send in an effort to provide you information that offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. You may opt-out of all special event notifications by editing your [email subscription](https://web.archive.org/account/edit).

### How We Use Feedback and Ratings

If you buy tickets to an event on the Site, we may solicit you by email for your feedback on the experience. Feedback may include ratings, reviews, names, taglines and/or photos. If you choose to give us feedback and you make your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Site in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review as part of the "Roar of the Crowd" email along with your member profile name. If you choose not to make your feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and producers. In the event that you unsubscribe or discontinue your membership, all feedback and your member profile will be considered not public and will not be published on the Site. _To request removal of your personal information from these posted feedbacks, please_ [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We strongly discourage you from disclosing any personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback, especially if you've chosen to make it public. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will be able to see this information. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this information but they are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages. From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Site. For example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain your consent. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us).

### How We Use Financial Information

Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications and bill you for products and services. Unique identifiers such as your date of birth are collected from you to verify your identity. We will not share financial or unique identifier information with third parties unless it is necessary to process your transaction (i.e. processing your credit card).

### How We Use Demographic Information

We use this information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. This information is shared with third parties only on an aggregate basis so that they can tailor our content to the appropriate audience.

### Other Sites/Third Party Vendors and Their Privacy Policies

The Site may contain links to other Web sites. Goldstar is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or for the privacy policies and practices of other third parties.

### Our Security Precautions

The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to maintain the security of your personal information when you complete a transaction or access your personal information. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, as it is transmitted through the Internet. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect User information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of the Site and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.

If you have created a Public Member Profile, you can change, modify and/or delete the profile information you have provided to us by editing feedback in your [profile](https://web.archive.org/account/edit). Changing or deleting any of this data will change or delete the data only in our member database, but will not change or delete information which we have collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in our transactions database. Users may change or update information related to transactions by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us) or replying to their confirmation email.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

You agree that, should you file any arbitration claim, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you will not be entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
