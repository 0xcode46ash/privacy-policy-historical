### How We Use Contact Information

Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site. A limited amount of personal information is provided to the venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events for which you purchase tickets. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Specifically, we disclose your name or the name of the gift recipients. We may also disclose other personal information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for handicap seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone number to the venue or event promoter to notify you of last minute changes that will affect your purchase. Examples of this might include cancellations and postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail, your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information and/or demographic information will not be disclosed. Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the shipping address. For some purchases, we may require additional permission from you to disclose other personal information such as your email address. A notice of what personal information and how it will be used will appear during the checkout process. Venues, suppliers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events are specifically prohibited from using personal information provided to them for any purpose other than fulfilling your purchase or admission, unless you specifically opt-in and authorize other uses.

We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from Goldstar. We carefully select the information we send in an effort to provide you information that offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. You may opt-out of all special event notifications by editing your [email subscription](https://web.archive.org/account/edit).

### How We Use Feedback and Ratings

If you buy tickets to an event on the Site, we may solicit you by email for your feedback on the experience. Feedback may include ratings, reviews, names, taglines and/or photos. If you choose to give us feedback and you make your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Site in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review as part of the "Roar of the Crowd" email along with your member profile name. If you choose not to make your feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and producers. In the event that you unsubscribe or discontinue your membership, all feedback and your member profile will be considered not public and will not be published on the Site. _To request removal of your personal information from these posted feedbacks, please_ [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We strongly discourage you from disclosing any personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback, especially if you've chosen to make it public. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will be able to see this information. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this information but they are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages. From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Site. For example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain your consent. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us).

### How We Use Financial Information

Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications and bill you for products and services. We will not share financial or unique identifier information with third parties unless it is necessary to process your transaction (i.e. processing your credit card).

### How We Use Demographic Information

We use this information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. This information is shared with third parties only on an aggregate basis so that they can tailor our content to the appropriate audience.
