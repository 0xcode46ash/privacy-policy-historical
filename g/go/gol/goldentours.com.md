As a valued Golden Tours customer, your personal privacy is very important to us. We respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with this website. Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy. 

Any information which is provided by you to Golden Tours will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and/or such amending or replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time. 

**Use of Customer Information**  
Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us or make a booking with us. We will up-date your information whenever we get the opportunity so that it is current, accurate and complete.

Any information obtained via this website will be used by Golden Tours to identify you as a customer, to process your booking, to verify credit or other charge card details and to deliver relevant information to you in connection with your travel and any other ancillary services which you may wish to avail of. For these purposes, we may transit your personal information to our own offices, authorised agents, other carriers and services providers, credit and charge card companies and data processing companies working on our behalf. Your personal information and any records relating to your travel will also be retained for audit functions. 

We ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you urgently if there is a problem with your reservation. 

We only use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your bookings or to contact you for any reason directly linked to your booking, or occasionally to inform you of new features on, or offers through, Golden Tours.

**Are my personal details secure?**  
Your personal information is submitted on a secure server with  a minimum of 128-bit SSL encryption and is used only to generate your ticket and/or contact you if there is any problem with your booking. Our site is secured by GlobalSign SSL Certificates which include SGC technology that forces a weaker 40 bit SSL session to at least 128 bit, and in most cases now 256 bit. 128-256 bit SSL sessions are trillions times stronger than 40 bit and allow all site visitors, no matter where they are in the world to benefit from stronger encryption levels. Few SSL Providers have the capability of offering SGC, and for those that do, SGC is often added as "pro" services and carries a premium price. Every GlobalSign SSL Certificate is capable of 256 bit strong SSL, and includes step-up SGC technology that forces weak browsers to stronger browsers free of charge. This means you can rest assured that communications between your browser and this site's web servers are private and secure.
