As is true of most websites, but subject to your browser settings, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and operating system.

We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.

We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live, and such personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Wherever we process or store your personal information we will, in addition to complying with all applicable laws and regulations in that jurisdiction, comply with this Privacy Policy.

It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this processing, storing and transfer.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

**Log Files**

As is true of most websites, but subject to your browser settings, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics, that uses cookies to track aggregate non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site such as number of visits, searched pages and browser type to improve our website and customer experience.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. More [information on cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) can be found here.

We set a persistent cookie to store your preferred currency, language settings and affiliate code, which is a unique code associated to the website that referred you to GoldMoney. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.

**Other Third Party Tracking**

Our third party advertising partner employs clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

**Google AdWords Remarketing**

GoldMoney uses, through its Website, the Google Adwords Remarking service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Website. Google AdWords Remarketing is a remarketing and behavioural targeting service provided by Google. It connects activity on www.goldmoney.com with the Adwords advertising network.

Google AdWords Remarketing displays relevant advertisements to you based on pages of the GoldMoney Website that you have viewed by placing a cookie on your computer. This cookie does not identify you or give us access to your computer.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as log-in credentials we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We restrict access to personal information to GoldMoney employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations at least equal to those we owe to you and such persons may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

If you have any questions about security on our website, please [contact us](http://www.goldmoney.com/contact).

For security reasons, we do not recommend saving your Holding number and passphrase in your computer's memory (do not allow your browser to remember your passphrase). Consequently, we advise entering your Holding number and passphrase each time you begin a new browser session and wish to view your Holding. Please read our [Security FAQ](http://www.goldmoney.com/faq.html?faq_cat=10) for important tips on accessing GoldMoney securely.
