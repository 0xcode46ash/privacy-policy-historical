## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

#### Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, but subject to your browser settings, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics, that uses cookies to track aggregate non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site such as number of visits, searched pages and browser type to improve our website and customer experience.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. More information on [cookies can be found here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).

We set a persistent cookie to store your preferred currency, language settings and affiliate code, which is a unique code associated to the website that referred you to GoldMoney. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.

#### Other Third Party Tracking

Our third party advertising partner employs clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as log-in credentials we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us.html).

For security reasons, we do not recommend saving your Holding number and Passphrase in your computer's memory (do not allow your browser to remember your Passphrase). Consequently, we advise entering your Holding number and Passphrase each time you begin a new browser session and wish to view your Holding.
