# GoldMoney - Privacy Policy

GoldMoney respects your privacy. All information collected by GoldMoney will be kept strictly confidential and will not be disclosed without your express consent except when GoldMoney is required to disclose information pertaining to you under the laws and regulations of Jersey, British Channel Islands, or by order of the Jersey courts or any other courts of competent jurisdiction or when GoldMoney is required, in order to fulfil its obligations in terms of the User Agreement, to disclose information pertaining to you to its agents or third-party business affiliates.

All customer records are kept safe and secure in GoldMoney's office and servers in Jersey, British Channel Islands, a 700 year old sovereign country. Jersey has become a major financial centre because it relies upon Anglo-Saxon common law, which puts property rights at the forefront. GoldMoney considers privacy to be an important property right.

At any time you may access and change your personal information that is in the possession of GoldMoney by logging into your Holding and by clicking the "Profile & Settings > Contact Details" link.

GoldMoney does not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personal information collected, including application forms, financial data or email addresses. GoldMoney may ask for your permission by email to disclose your personal data to service providers not affiliated with GoldMoney, but you have the right to refuse.

For security reasons, we do not recommend saving your Holding number and Passphrase in your computer's memory (do not allow your browser to remember your Passphrase). Consequently, we advise entering your Holding number and Passphrase each time you begin a new browser session and wish to view your Holding.
