Privacy Policy and Notice for The Golden 1 Credit Union

**Effective January 1, 2005  
**

The Golden 1 is committed to providing you with financial products and services to meet your needs and to help you reach your financial goals. Protecting the privacy and security of your personal information and ensuring the accuracy of such information is one of our top priorities. The Golden 1 doesn’t sell any of your personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, although we do disclose that information as provided below. This privacy policy describes how The Golden 1 collects and uses your personal information, and how we maintain the confidentiality and accuracy of such information. This policy is provided pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the Federal Privacy Act).

**Information That We Collect about You**  
We collect and maintain your information to serve you and to administer your relationship with The Golden 1. We collect nonpublic personal information about you from a variety of sources, such as: 

  * Information we receive verbally, electronically, or in writing from you on applications or other forms
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency
  * Information about your transactions with us or others



**Information Use and Disclosure with Nonaffiliated Third Parties or Affiliates**  
When it comes to The Golden 1 sharing your information with an outside party, we do so only as permitted or required by law and for specific purposes to provide you products and services. We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as previously described. We share this information to provide those products and services and a good member experience. We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law, including the following:

  * Financial service providers, such as companies that service your loan, provide insurance or securities products or relationships, mortgage insurers or payment processing, mortgage bankers, securities brokers/dealers, and insurance agents
  * Nonfinancial companies, such as companies that perform services on our behalf, such as check printers, data processing companies, companies that prepare and mail account statements or notices, and companies that help us market our own products and services to you
  * Other companies, such as independent contractors, including technical system consultants who program the software that helps us administer our products or market our products to you



**Information Disclosed to Outside Parties Who Are Service Providers and Financial Institutions with Whom We Have Joint Marketing Agreements**  
We may disclose all of the information we collect from you, as previously described, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. For example, through a joint marketing arrangement, we offer brokerage and securities services from another financial provider.

**Information Disclosed to Outside Parties in Other Situations**  
The Golden 1 might disclose your information to government agencies, consumer reporting agencies, and other outside parties as permitted or required by the Federal Privacy Act and other applicable laws. These disclosures are made for specific, limited purposes, for example:

  * To verify individuals’ identities (reducing fraud and identity theft) 
  * To meet your service expectations (such as access to ATM networks and processing applications for loans or insurance) 
  * To protect your accounts or business records against fraud and unauthorized transactions, to resolve disputes and, as necessary, to our regulators, attorneys, accountants, and auditors 



In no event will we share any account number or any access code to any of your Golden 1 accounts with anyone, except as permitted by law. 

**Disclosure of Information about Former Members**  
It is generally unnecessary for us to disclose information about former members or account owners of The Golden 1 to others that have a relationship with us; however, to the extent we do disclose information, we will adhere to the same policies as previously described.

**How We Protect Your Information**  
We restrict access to nonpublic, personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and privacy. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic, personal information.
