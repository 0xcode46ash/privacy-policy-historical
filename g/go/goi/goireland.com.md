## BOOKING ACCOMMODATION

**Making a booking**   
When making a booking for accommodation on our website we collect your name, address, email address as well as your credit or debit card number and expiry date. We use this information to process your booking. When you book, your information is encrypted and passed through a secure server. We retain this information, for 120 days after your booking, to deal with any queries you or the accommodation owner may have after your stay. 

The information you provide, including your full credit card details, are also made available to the accommodation provider. This is because under our terms and conditions, if a cancellation occurs within specific time periods, the accommodation provider is entitled to deduct from your credit card the full cost of your first nights stay. We request that accommodation providers keep your details secure and private, and not to hold onto your information for a period greater than 120 days from the date of the booking, however, we cannot be held responsible for any accommodation provider’s misuse of personal information. 

We also ask for your telephone number so our customer support representatives and the accommodation provider can contact you if there is a question concerning your reservation. 

**Marketing Information**   
Where you have indicated that we may do so, we use the information that you have provided when making a booking, to inform you of new products or services offered by us, or to supply you with other promotional information. We also, with your consent, provide your details to selected third parties who may also inform you of new offers or promotions. You can contact us at any time where you no longer wish to receive such information.

## SECURITY

**Security Statement**   
Security remains the primary concern of on-line consumers. The VeriSign Secure Site Program allows you to learn more about web sites you visit before you submit any confidential information. 

We guarantee that every transaction you make with us will be 100% safe. This means you will not be out of pocket if unauthorised charges are made to your credit or debit card as a result of bookings made through us. 

**Our Safe Shopping Guarantee**   
None of our on-line customers have reported fraudulent use of a credit or debit card as a result of a booking through our service. We are confident about the transaction security we offer on this site and back every booking with a security guarantee, as follows:- 

  * Our secure server software encrypts all your personal information including credit or debit card number, name and address. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code that are then securely transmitted over the Internet; 
  * In the event of unauthorised use of your credit or debit card, most banks and card issuers either cover all the charges or may limit your liability to just €63; 
  * If your bank or card issuer holds you liable, Gulliver Ireland will cover your liability up to €63 provided that the unauthorised use of your credit or debit card resulted through no fault of your own from bookings made through the site while using the secure server. 



**Additional Points on Security**

  * This guarantee only applies to credit or debit card purchases made using our secure server and not other services that may be available from the goireland.com or gulliver.ie websites; 
  * This guarantee covers a maximum liability of €63. 
  * In the event of unauthorised use of your credit or debit card, you must notify your card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. 



To give you an additional layer of security, all credit or debit card numbers are stored on a computer that is not connected to the Internet. After you type in your complete card number, it is transferred to this secure machine across a proprietary one-way interface. This computer is not accessible by network or modem and the number is not stored anywhere else
