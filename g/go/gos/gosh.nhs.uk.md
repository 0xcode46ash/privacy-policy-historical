# Privacy | Great Ormond Street Hospital

Great Ormond Street Hospital is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we will handle the personal information you provide to us and what we learn about you from your visit to our web site.  
By using this site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy then please do not use this site.

## Data Protection Act

We are conscious of our responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 and we shall endeavour to ensure that any personal information we obtain and use will always be held, used, transferred and otherwise processed in accordance with that Act and all other applicable data protection laws and regulations. 

## What is personal information?

Personal information is information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, date of birth, email address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and credit/debit card details. 

## What personal information do we collect?

We collect personal information when you ask about our activities, register with us (for example, registering on a discussion board), order products and services (such as publications and email newsletters), or otherwise give us personal information.   
By submitting personal data manually or in electronic form to this website, or by using this site, you automatically give your consent that all personal data you submit may be processed in the manner and for the purposes described below.

## Other information we collect

If you do nothing other than read pages or download information while using this web site, we will collect information about your visit. This information will not personally identify you. It relates to   
(i) the Internet domain and IP address from which you access the web site   
(ii) the type of browser and operating system you use   
(iii) the date and time of your visit, 

(iv) demographic and interest information from Google,   

(v) the pages you visit, and   
(vi) the address of the website from which you linked to us (if applicable).  


## Why do we collect information, including personal information?

We collect information to help us improve our web service and the information available to users, make each visit more rewarding and enable online interaction with GOSH.  


## How do we use your information?

We will use your information (personal or otherwise) to provide you with the services, products or information you have requested. We may need to share your information with our service providers, associated organisations and agents for these purposes.

The data we collect is used in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) to monitor the use of our website and to research our users' behaviour, demographics and interests. This allows us to gain a better understanding of how our users navigate and use the website and, therefore, improve our service to you and to the hospital. By using the demographic and interest reports, we are able to tailor sections of the website for the people who use it and in particular for the patients and their parents.  
Any information (personal or otherwise) we collect is stored and processed in the UK. Your information is not shared with third parties or used in any other way, other than described in this policy or as required by law, unless you agree.  
We reserve the right to share your personal information if we are legally obliged to and to enable us to apply our terms and conditions and other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other organisations for fraud and credit risk reduction and for police investigations.  


## Security of information

Great Ormond Street hospital is responsible for holding the data it collects from you securely.  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. As a result, while we use our best endeavours to protect your information, Great Ormond Street Hospital cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. When we collect your information, we use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access.  


## How we use cookies

Great Ormond Street Hospital uses cookies to monitor the usage of our website. A cookie is a small text file we pass to your computer’s hard disk through your web browser so the website remembers who you are when you return. It also tracks statistics such as how you arrived at the site, your time of arrival, the pages that you looked at and how long you stayed on the website.   
This information helps us to improve our website.   
The information we collect through cookies is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

## The accuracy of your information

While we endeavour to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, we shall assume that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the information you provide us with is accurate. If you inform us, or we become aware, of any inaccuracies in the information it shall be promptly rectified by us. We do not retain any information about you which is out of date or which is no longer required.
