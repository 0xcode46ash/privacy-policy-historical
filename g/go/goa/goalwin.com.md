As a part of that commitment, we have implemented this Privacy Policy to reflect the current needs of our visitors to know what information about them we collect, why we collect it, and where it goes. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy.

This document sets out the Goalwin policy for handling personal information. Goalwin is bound by, and committed to, the terms of the Privacy Act 1988 and the National Privacy Principles forming part of that Act.

### What is Personal Information?

Personal information is any information about you that identifies you or by which your identity can be reasonably determined.

### What kind of Personal Information do we collect and hold about you?

Goalwin only collects personal information that is necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. The types of personal information which are collected from our clients includes name, address, payment card details, details of betting transactions and account transfers and any other information clients wish to provide.

### How do we collect Personal Information from you?

Personal Information may be submitted to our website. You will be asked to provide your Personal Information in this area for the purpose of registering with Goalwin and opening an account with us. A "session cookie" is used to enable you to leave and re-enter our website without re-entering your password. Our web server will record the pages you visit within our website. Where possible, we will give you the opportunity to decline to provide any personal information we request, but in some cases your use of this website may be restricted if you do not provide the requested information.

### How will your Personal Information be used?

Goalwin will process your Personal Information to administer your account, maintain our accounts and records, monitor website usage levels and the quality of the service we provide and to inform you, from time to time, about products and services that we consider may interest you. Goalwin will also retain such information and may analyse it if asked to do so in order to investigate any actual or suspected criminal activity or, in respect of any event featured on our website, any threat to the integrity of that event and/or breaches of the rules of that event as laid down by the relevant governing (including sporting) bodies. All rights in the manner of recording your Personal Information held by Goalwin (including copyright and database rights) are and shall remain its property.

### To whom and where personal information may be disclosed?

Goalwin may disclose your personal information in certain circumstances. Sometimes we are required or authorised by law to disclose your personal information. For example we may disclose your personal information to a court in response to a subpoena or to the Inland Revenue Department following a direction issued under taxation laws. We may also disclose your personal information where you have consented to us doing so. Your consent to the disclosure of your personal information may be given explicitly such as in writing or verbally or may be implied from your conduct such as when you discuss details of the relationship you have with us publicly with the media. Additionally, your Personal Information may be disclosed to any regulatory or sporting body in connection with policing the integrity or enforcing the rules of a sport or game and/or prevention and detection of crime and with whom Goalwin has agreements from time to time for the sharing of such data and where Goalwin considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you may be involved in a breach of such rules or the law, have knowledge of a breach of such rules or the law or otherwise pose a threat to the integrity of the relevant sport or game. Those bodies may then use your Personal Information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.

### Consent
