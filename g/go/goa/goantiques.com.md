**Cookies, what are they and how are they used?**

A cookie is a small piece of information that web sites use to remember information about users. Cookies also allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them.

You will be given an option to unsubscribe from each newsletter and announcement that you receive.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information for promotional purposes, to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on this website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out the registration form, but we will not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. We may also use such information in connection with matters covered by the above Paragraphs entitled "Verification and Credit Information" and "Fraudulent or Improper Conduct".

GoAntiques shall use commercially reasonable efforts so that such aggregate form does not permit the recipient to identify you or any of the specific transactions pertaining to any of them; or (ii) use such data to aid GoAntiques or any third party in providing services in competition with you. In the event GoAntiques discloses such transaction data to any third party, we shall make a good faith effort to ensure that your name and other personal information cannot be deduced by such third parties from such disclosed transaction data.
