###  Orders

We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (name, billing address, shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you. You can also place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service. 

###  Sharing

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order. 

###  Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the web address (or URL) of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

###  Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, interests, address, etc.), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. By entering any of our contests, giveaways, or surveys, you agree to subscribe to and receive our email communications. You may however, opt out of these email communications by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of the emails you receive.

This information helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. It also allows us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits. This includes our content presented on other websites or mobile applications.

We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.

###  International Customer Privacy

For non-US transactions, we have partnered with third party companies ("Vendors") that we have selected to help us faciliate international transactions. We work closely with these Vendors to ensure that your transaction is handled with care and all the information you provide is secure.

As an international customer, when you click on the checkout button, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by a Vendor to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be required to select a method of payment and submit credit card and other information to such Vendor to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be presented with the Vendor's terms and conditions which you must agree to in order to complete your order.

If and when applicable, upon completion and approval of your order by such Vendor, the Vendor will notify us of the approval and we will process your order. In this process, the Vendor will purchase those items in your order from us, thereby taking title to the items, bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the delivery of your order. In this process, the Vendor makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obligated to deliver your order set forth in our Terms and Conditions.

**If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 1-888-794-6250 or via email[administrator@goalzero.com](mailto:administrator@goalzero.com)**
