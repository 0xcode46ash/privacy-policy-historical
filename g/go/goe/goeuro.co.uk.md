We have no control over these cookies and the data collected in this and cannot accept any responsibility in that regard. 

II. How do we use your data and with whom we share? 

1\. Anonymous Data    
The automatically gathered data, which have no personal reference is used to perform statistical analysis or market research and may therefore be passed on to partners, advertisers or other third parties. 

2\. Personal Data    
We take the necessary precautions to ensure the protection of personal data provided by you. The partners and service providers to whom we will transfer your data for approved use, are bound by contractual arrangements with us based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure an adequate level of data protection. 

In particular:

These third parties will then use your personal information in accordance with their own respective privacy policies.

If you make a booking directly via our booking page, this booking will be processed either by the GoEuro Travel GmbH or the GoEuro Voyages SAS. The GoEuro Travel GmbH and the GoEuro Voyages SAS are affiliated companies of GoEuro Corp. The personal data required for the booking are forwarded to these affiliated companies for the approved use only - on the basis of Agreements for Commissioned Data Processing.

Then the service provider will present to you non-binding offers to match your requirements in a new window or tab. A transfer of personal data (except the IP address) does not occur on our part. 

c) Use of retargeting functions    
Our website uses what are known as "retargeting tags" for presentation of interest-related advertising. A "retargeting tag" is the name for a JavaScript element that is placed in the website’s source code. If a user visits a page on this website that contains a "retargeting tag", a provider of online advertising (e.g. Google) places a cookie on this user’s computer and allocates it to corresponding retargeting target group lists. This cookie then serves the purpose of displaying retargeting campaigns ("interest-related advertising") on other websites. Third-party providers, including Google, use these cookies to display advertisements on the basis of a user’s previous visits to our website. No personal data (with the exception of IP-addresses) is stored. Users of this website can deactivate the use of cookies by Google by bringing up the page “Google ads settings”, ([http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/](https://web.archive.org/web/20160617164218id_/http%3A//www.goeuro.co.uk/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.google.com/ads/preferences/%E2%80%9D)). In addition, users can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers by visiting the deactivation page of the "Network Advertising Initiative" and making the appropriate settings there. ([http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](https://web.archive.org/web/20160617164218id_/http%3A//www.goeuro.co.uk/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp%E2%80%9D)) 

d) Disclosure on the order of the authorities    
We might have to disclose personal information when we are legally obliged by law or be obliged by law enforcement or other authorized authorities to do so. A disclosure of personal data (in particular the name, e-mail address or the address) to public authorities or authorized third parties is only carried out only if the stipulations of the law require that we do so, e.g. by order of the competent authorities, such as police authorities or owners of intellectual property rights, for example, for law enforcement or security reasons.

We may also disclose your information if disclosure of the information is necessary to prevent immediate physical harm or financial loss or to report a suspected illegal activity to uncover or prevent or to enforce our rights and claims.

III. Data Security 

We undertake a variety of efforts to protect your data from unauthorized access by third parties, accidental disclosure and / or accidental deletion. We use a variety of technological measures such as encryption, firewall and / or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

As part of our services we offer links and references to other websites and direct you to these sites for inquiries. Some of these websites may even be provided with the name or logo of GoEuro.

In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third parties unless required by law or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You can prevent the installation of cookies by changing the settings of your browser. However, we would like to point out that in this case perhaps not all the features of our services might work. You might, at any time, object the collection and use of your IP address by Google Analytics, with effect for the future. More information can be found here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20160617164218id_/http%3A//www.goeuro.co.uk/%E2%80%9Dhttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en%E2%80%9D) (A variety of downloadable deactivation add-ons for browser from Google Analytics) 

VI. Social Plugins (namely Facebook) 

On our service pages we integrate applications from other service providers that offer users additional services and functionality that we do not provide, which allow for networking with other sites, especially the so-called social plugins "Like" and "Share" of Facebook ("plugin"). These plugins are identifiable by the logo of the respective service provider. If such a plugin is accessed from our service pages, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of the respective service provider. The content of the plugin is transferred by the respective service provider directly to the browser. Via this plugin, data may be collected by the service provider, processed and stored. 

GoEuro does not provide any of your personal information to these service providers but we cannot influence the extent to which data is collected via the plugin. For the collection and processing of such data, the data protection provisions of the respective provider apply. In regard to the service provider Facebook, we like to indicate the following: If you are registered with Facebook (and you are logged in), Facebook can assign your visit to GoEuro and its interaction with the Facebook plugin to your Facebook account and might indicate the use of the "like "or "share" on your Facebook profile, while such information is provided directly by the browser to Facebook and is stored there.

We might also allow Facebook users to register with us using the integrated application "Facebook Connect". This application allows the transfer of certain personal information (deposited with Facebook) to us. Facebook will inform you during the registration process about which data is to be transferred ("Facebook data") for which purpose - you may express consent or refuse such information transfer. Without your prior consent none of your personal information from Facebook will be transferred to us.We will use the Facebook data only for the purposes outlined in these privacy conditions. In addition, we use it only in an anonymous form, to create statistics and analysis for the purpose of improving and developing our range of service. 

VII. Changes and updates of our Privacy Policy Statement 

GoEuro may update and amend this Privacy Policy Statement as necessary. In case of significant changes our registered users will be informed by email. Users who are not registered with us will be informed about such updates on our services sites. The changes take effect 14 days after such notification. Only minor and insignificant changes take effect immediately and without any notice given. Please read this Privacy Policy Statement periodically and keep informed about current regulations. If you keep using the services and the websites after we have made an update to this Privacy Policy, you are giving your consent to the updated Privacy Policy. 

VIII. Transmission of data to third countries 

Data transmission to third countries (outside the EU) by us will only be performed insofar as the data transmission is fundamentally permissible and the specific requisites for transfer to a third country have been met; in particular, the data importer must guarantee an acceptable level of data protection in accordance with EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the transmission of personal data to order processing organizations in third countries. This is founded on the basis of EU Data Protection Laws.
