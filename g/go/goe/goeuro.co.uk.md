(All together hereinafter referred to as "service" or "services".) The protection of your personal information is very important to us. Therefore, the following information states the rules that we follow to protect the personal data of our users. By using our websites and / or services, you accept and approve these terms.

##### I. Data gathered

Generally, our websites and our services can be used by the user without the requirement of transfer of personal data. However, in order to further optimize the websites and to align the needs of our users, certain information and data may be used, including data resulting from the use of websites connection information and also the data entered by the user directly or indirectly.

##### 1\. Automatically gathered Data

In order to improve our websites and the services, we collect connection information data that is generated regularly by using the Internet and is provided by the browser you are using to visit our sites. Such information includes your Internet access provider, the browser used, the operating system used, the access device used, date and time of access, pages viewed on our websites, the time that you spend on our websites, plus, the sites that you have visited before and after your visit on to our sites. We use this information to 

  * continue to improve the websites and services technically and adapt them to the needs of our users,
  * recognize, identify and correct malfunctions and possible abuse,

Furthermore, we also save and use the information you provide to us about yourself and about the planning of your trip. In general, you can visit our website and use the services without prior registration. However, by registering on our website and by transferring the required personal data you can create your custom user profile. By doing so, you allow us to personalize and tailor our services in order to make the handling easier and more comfortable for you. If you want to create a personal profile, your email address and other personal data will be requested during registration process. This information will be needed to recognize you and avoid re-entering your data upon your revisits to our sites. And also in order to adapt our websites and our service to your personal preferences and to be able to display advertisements and special offers that may match your interests (or spare you the display of advertising and special offers, which probably may not be of any interest to you). In addition, you can provide us with additional information (e.g. your customer discount and/or frequent flyer program ID, your travel preferences, such as your preferred means of transport, your hometown and your preferred currency) so that the use of the websites and the mobile app gets even more comfortable and we are able to create more personalized offers for you. With the registration and transfer of such data, you authorize us to collect, process, store, and otherwise use this personal information - together with the automatically gathered data (see above). Credit card payments for bookings made on our websites are processed via a certified jnternet payment service provider (PSP). Our PSP uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to secure the processing of payments, so your credit card details are sent to the PSP and the credit card acquirer only after they are encrypted. Also, reports from the PSP to us are always encrypted before they are transferred. Your credit card data is stored on the PSP's computers with state of the art security. GoEuro will not be able to access your credit card information.

These plugins are identifiable by the logo of the respective service provider. If such a plugin is accessed from our service pages, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of the respective service provider. The content of the plugin is transferred by the respective service provider directly to the browser. Via this plugin, data may be collected by the service provider, processed and stored. GoEuro does not provide any of your personal information to these service providers but we cannot influence the extent to which data is collected via the plugin.

We also allow Facebook users to register with us using the integrated application "Facebook Connect". This application allows the transfer of certain personal information (deposited with Facebook) to us.
