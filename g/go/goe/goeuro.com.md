# Privacy | GoEuro

Operator of the GoEuro websites and mobile apps as well as responsible authority in terms of the Data Protection Legislation is the GoEuro Corp., registered in Delaware, USA, under No. 4973690. GoEuro Corp. has its operative headquarters at 180 Schönhauser Allee in 10119 Berlin.

The protection of your personal information is very important to us. Therefore, the following details the rules that we follow to protect the personal data of our users. By using our websites or app, booking travel or creating an account, you accept and approve these terms. 

I. What kind of data we gather and why 

######  1\. Automatically gathered Data 

We collect connection information data that is transmitted regularly by your browser to our web server when you surf the Internet. Such information includes your IP address, the URLs of the sites you visited before accessing our sites, the browser used, the operating system used, the access device used, date and time of your access, the pages viewed on our websites and the time you spend on our websites.

We do not use IP addresses to identify users. If you visit our website without using a previously created profile or make any bookings, you will remain anonymous. 

We use this information to

  * continue to improve the websites and services technically and adapt them to the needs of our users, 
  * recognize, identify and correct malfunctions and possible abuse, 
  * create aggregated statistics on access channels and the transition to our partner’s websites. 



######  2\. Data provided by you, the user 

Furthermore, we also save and use the information you provide to us about yourself and about the planning of your trip. 

When you book a travel product through our service sites, we ask you to provide personal data, e.g. your name, your e-mail address, phone number, billing address, payment or credit card information, your preferred travel connection and – where applicable – information about your bonus or discount cards (e.g. mileage or frequent-flyer programmes, railway customer cards). We will only ever ask you for the data that the respective travel agent requires to complete the booking process. 

Should you additionally register for a personal profile with GoEuro by creating a user account, this data will be stored with us for your future bookings. 

We will use this information for the purposes described in Section1 above and also

  * to execute your booking and personalize your ticket or reservation,
  * to recognize you and spare you from re-entering your data upon your revisits to our sites,
  * in order to adapt our websites and our service to your personal preferences and to be able to display advertisements and special offers that may match your interests (or spare you the display of advertising and special offers which would likely not be of any interest to you),
  * to get in touch with you, e.g. to send you travel documents or to notify you about new features and special offers on our website, for example through our newsletter.



######  3\. Executing bookings 

If you make a booking on our websites, we will transmit any personal data required to the respective travel agent (e.g. airline, railway or coach operator, hire car company, hotel) so that the agent can process your booking and produce any personalised tickets that may be required. Such a third party will then be responsible itself for how it uses your personal data and will use it in accordance with its own privacy policies. 

Bookings may be handled by our subsidiary GoEuro Voyages SAS. GoEuro Voyages SAS then processes all required data on our behalf and only for the purposes of completing the booking process. 

The payment details (credit card information) for bookings made directly on our website are processed by a trusted Internet payment processor, who will transmit your data directly to the relevant credit card company. 

In order to ensure that the credit card is used by the legitimate owner and to prevent cases of online fraud, encrypted credit card information is transferred to an external payment security service for auditing purposes. This transfer may also include additional personal data. This transfer and the handling of the data will be performed in full accordance with applicable data protection provisions. 

Your credit card data is processed by trusted and reliable Internet payment processors. Your credit card details are encrypted (usually using the SSL protocol) before transmission to the payment processor. 

In addition, basic information relating to your query (e.g. destination and travel dates) will be transmitted to the accommodation providers shown in the search window (e.g. booking.com or airbnb), but only if the check mark in front of the respective provider’s name is set for your search. You will then see non-binding offers matching your search query by the provider in a new window or tab. This does not entail transmission on our part of any personal data (except for the IP address). 

######  4\. Logging in with Facebook Connect or Google+ 

It will also be possible to log in to our site using Facebook Connect or Google+. Doing so does not require you to register a separate user account with us. Instead, you can log in using your Facebook or Google login. In the process, Facebook or Google transmit certain personal data to us. Facebook will inform you during registration about the data to be transmitted (Facebook data). You will be given the opportunity to consent explicitly or to refuse. Facebook will not transmit any personal data to us without your permission. We will then be able to see your Facebook user name and your public Facebook profile. We will use this data solely for the purposes detailed in this privacy policy. Conversely, Facebook will be able to see whether and when you log in to our site using Facebook Connect. All of this applies equally for any logins via Google. 

You consent to Facebook transmitting the above data to us and to our transmitting said data to Facebook or Google when using Facebook Connect or Google+. You can stop using Facebook Connect or the Google+ login at any time and, if desired, create your own user account with us. 

######  5\. Newsletter 

By subscribing to our newsletter, you consent to receiving newsletters and notifications from us by e-mail. These e-mails will contain information about GoEuro and may also include advertising for GoEuro or from/for third parties. You can unsubscribe from these regular newsletters easily and at no cost using the corresponding link provided in the respective newsletter. 

######  6\. Use of cookies, web beacons and similar methods 

Like most other service providers, we use cookies, web beacons and suchlike when you visit our websites or use our services. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device and which allow re-identification of your computer or mobile device, potentially across numerous websites. These cookies contain no personal data. Some of the cookies we use are deleted again upon expiry of the session, that is, when you close your browser (these are referred to as session cookies). Other cookies remain stored on your device and allow us, or our business partners to recognise your browser during subsequent visits (persistent cookies). 

You may prevent cookies by configuring your browser software accordingly. However, please note that certain areas of the websites or certain services may then not work as intended (such as your user account settings, the order process or saving your preferred means of transport). 

Web beacons are small graphics files (pixels) that may be embedded in our website for the purposes of recording user behaviour. Similar methods include, for example, flash cookies, HTML5 cookies or other local (browser or device) storage methods that – in a similar way to cookies – allow data to be saved to your browser or device so that your browser or device can be recognised during subsequent visits or during a session. 

The use of cookies and similar methods allows us to collect information about users in order to enable us to customise the websites for easier and more convenient access and to provide improved service. 

We use cookies and similar methods for the following purposes: 

  * To save your user settings such as language and currency while on our websites and between visits. 
  * To store your login status as a registered user (optional), so you do not have to log in again when returning to the website later. 
  * For our feedback tool "UserVoice", which allows you to leave comments and suggestions for GoEuro. 
  * For the technical assignment of your visit to certain servers to ensure a safe transition between pages and search queries. 
  * To monitor the performance of our systems (no user-based evaluation of data). 
  * For web analytics with Google Analytics and similar web analytics services and for creating usage statistics (no user-based evaluation). 
  * For what is known as retargeting, i.e. for displaying ads that match your search queries on GoEuro, on other websites and in mobile apps. To learn more about this type of targeted advertising and your options for preventing it, follow this link: [Youronlinechoices](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)



If you click a link on our websites that takes you to websites of other providers (for example for making a booking or to buy a ticket), it is possible that these other websites also store cookies on your computer. We have no control over these cookies and the data collected in this way and cannot accept any responsibility in that regard. 

######  7\. Use of retargeting tags 

Our website uses what are known as retargeting tags for presentation of interest-related advertising. A retargeting tag is the name for a JavaScript element that is placed in the website’s source code. If a user visits a page on a website that contains a retargeting tag, a provider of online advertising (e.g. Google) places a cookie on that user’s computer and allocates it to corresponding retargeting target group lists. The cookie then serves the purpose of displaying retargeting campaigns ("interest-related advertising") on other websites. Third-party providers, including Google, use these cookies to display advertisements on the basis of a user’s previous visits to our website. No personal data (with the exception of IP-addresses) is stored. 

Users of this website can deactivate the use of cookies by Google by bringing up the page “Google ads settings”, (<http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/> ). In addition, users can deactivate the use of cookies by third-party providers by visiting the deactivation page of the "Network Advertising Initiative" and making the appropriate settings there. (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>). Facebook also links to the Initiative: <https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217>

II. Data Security 

We undertake a variety of efforts to protect your data from unauthorised access by third parties, accidental disclosure and/or accidental deletion. We use a variety of technological measures such as encryption, firewall and/or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 

We outsource certain issues to technology service providers (e.g. technical website hosting) or other service providers. We will forward personal data to these service providers only where this is required for them to perform their services for us. We place our service providers under contractual obligation to observe data protection and data security regulations. 

III. Google Analytics 

On our websites, we use "Google Analytics", a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., or comparable web analytics services. Google uses cookies, which are stored on the user's computer and allow us to analyse the use of our website. The information generated by the cookie about the use, including the current, but truncated user's IP address are transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate the use of our website, compiling reports on the activities of the users of our services and to provide other services associated with Internet use. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required to do so by law or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You can prevent the installation of cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Please note, however, that this may prevent some of our services’ feature from working correctly. You may, at any time, revoke consent to any future recording and use of your IP address by Google Analytics. More information can be found here: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> (a selection of downloadable deactivation add-ons for browsers from Google Analytics). 

IV. wywy Analytics Service 

For our TV advert, we use the analytics tool by the Berlin-based company wywy. We use it to analyse how often our advert is clicked and which websites the viewers came from. This entails recording your IP address and, in some cases, identification of your operating system and browser. This data cannot be used to identify you. Refer to wywy’s privacy policy to learn how you can prevent your visit to sites hosting our TV advert from being recorded: <http://wywy.com/wywy-opt-out/>. 

V. Optimizely Web Analytics Service 

We employ Optimizely, a web analytics tool provided by Optimizely, Inc. Optimizely utilises cookies that are saved to your computer and that allow analysis of how you use our website. The information about your use of our websites produced by the cookie is usually transmitted to and stored on a server owned by Optimizely in the USA. 

If, however, you have activated IP anonymisation on this website, Optimizely will truncate your IP address within European Union member states or in other states party to the Treaty on the European Economic Area. In exceptional cases only, your IP address will be transmitted in full to an Optimizely server in the USA and truncated there. Optimizely will use this information on our behalf to analyse how you use our website and to compile reports on website activity. 

The IP address transmitted by your browser, as part of the Optimizely process, will not be correlated with any other Optimizely data. You can prevent the saving of cookies by configuring your browser accordingly; please note, however, that this may prevent you from fully using all of our website’s functionality. Additionally, you can disable Optimizely tracking at any time by following the instructions at http://www.optimizely.com/opt_out. 

VI. Social Plugins 

Our website uses what is referred to as social plugins by the following social media providers: 

  * Facebook Like published by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, United States 
  * Twitter published by Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States 



Social plugins are software modules developed by social media providers. We have incorporated these modules into our website. Social plugins use your browser to set up a direct connection to the servers of the respective social media provider. This informs the social media provider that you have accessed the part of our website incorporating the social plugin. If you are registered with the respective social media provider and are logged in, the provider may be able to correlate your visit to our website and your further interaction with the social plugin (e.g. clicking Like) with your user account. If you are not registered with or logged in to the respective social media provider, the provider may save your IP address. 

To protect you from such data transmission to the respective social media provider, we have set up according technical precautions (2-click solution). The two-stage solution provides you with an opportunity to consent to the use of the respective social plugin before it transmits data to the social media provider. You can grant consent case-by-case or permanently. Permanent consent can be revoked. This means that if you do not want a social media provider to record data using social plugins on our website, do not activate the respective social plugin by clicking it. 

For further details on how Facebook uses the respective plugin and the corresponding social media service, refer to: <http://developers.facebook.com/plugins>

Further details on Facebook’s data policies are available at: <http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy>

VII. GoEuro App 

The GoEuro app is an alternative way to access offers by GoEuro. The GoEuro app in principle records, processes and utilises data in the same way as the GoEuro website. The contents of this privacy policy thus apply accordingly. 

When using the app, GoEuro can access additional data relating to the app or your mobile device, e.g. the device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system version, app version or SDK version. If you are using an Android device, the app can also detect what Google services you have subscribed to and can prevent your device from going into standby while the app is running. 

We record your device’s current location to use it for processing your query (filling in your location in the search form). Your position data is transmitted through an encrypted connection. If you use GPS, the app will detect your precise location. If your device runs iOs, this will require you to grant permission first. 

If you have configured your mobile device accordingly, the GoEuro app will be able to send you push messages, e.g. to provide updates on GoEuro, status updates, campaigns, other news or to notify you of new features. 

By enabling push notification, you consent to receiving messages from us that may include advertising for GoEuro or from/for third parties in addition to information from GoEuro. You can adjust the settings for receiving push notification or unsubscribe from them at any time using the app or your operating system configurations. 

VIII. Changes and Updates to our Privacy Policy Statement 

GoEuro may update and amend this Privacy Policy Statement as necessary. We will notify our registered users of changes by e-mail and ask once more for their consent.
