# Privacy Statement | The VHS Collaborative

## April 5, 2011

The VHS Collaborative established this privacy policy to let you know how we collect, use, share and protect information that we may gather from our web site. This policy does not apply to information that we may collect from you outside of our web site, such as by phone, FAX, or through postal mail. This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from VHS. The information collected or received by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.

### Security of Your Information

Our site has security measures to protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of personal or confidential business information under our control. Student educational records are protected by VHS Inc. as required by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and similar state laws. VHS strictly adheres to FERPA policies and regulations. Furthermore student information cannot be shared with parents, siblings, spouses, and/or friends without express written permission of the student.

### Personal Information Provided by Parents About Children

We understand that our student users who are under 13 years of age need special safeguards and privacy protection, and it is our intent to fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). VHS does not collect personal information from children online at any point. You can review certain personal information that VHS has regarding your child by making such a request in writing to [privacy@TheVHSCollaborative.org](mailto:privacy@thevhscollaborative.org?subject=&cc=&bcc=&body=). Please be aware that some personal information relating to your children’s educational records may not be able to be disclosed by VHS due to state and/or federal law.

You can request that your children’s personal information not be used by VHS, and any affiliates and/or vendors acting on behalf of VHS, by making a request in writing to VHS.

### Information We Collect

If you contact us or sign up for VHS newsletters, webinars, courses, or other offerings we will collect the information you submit to us, whether through an online form, email, or other communication.

We may also use "cookies" to track when you have returned to a specific page. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We may use cookies to help us understand the products and pages that interest you, personalize your experience on our website, and recall your specific information such as personal information, billing addresses, and so on to simply the process of recording your information on subsequent visits.

Beyond that, the only information about your visit that we receive is the standard Internet log information collected by all websites. This includes the host system from which your visit originated and the time and duration of your visits to our pages. No personally identifiable information is collected about you in this process, and the log information is combined with all other visits to create traffic statistics. Such statistics help organizations know overall traffic levels to their website.

### How We Use Information

If you contact us directly, we will respond to your request or take other suitable action. The information regarding your contact remains within VHS and VHS will not share, sell, or trade any personally identifiable information to any third party.

We collect and use your personal information to operate the VHS website and deliver the services you have requested.

In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to VHS, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from VHS and our affiliates. We may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services. We may also, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

You may choose not to receive marketing or promotional emails from VHS, by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of the emails we send you. Additionally, you may unsubscribe by contacting us directly by phone or mail.

Our work, including our web statistics, is not automatically available to the government or to the public, and any information we choose to share will be on an aggregated, non-identifying basis.

We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on VHS, Inc. or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of VHS; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of VHS services, or the public.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to protect sensitive personal information.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

We will occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is documented at the beginning of the Privacy Policy.
