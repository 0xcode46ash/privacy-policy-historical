# GovX. Privacy Policy

**Overview** _Respecting and Protecting Your Privacy_. Your privacy is important to GovX, LLC. (hereinafter referred to as, “GovX”, "we", "us", or "our"). We want you to make sure you have a spectacular shopping experience on our GovX.com Web site (“Site”) and while only our Members can access pricing and actually purchase products, we know that anyone visiting our Site will want to be informed about how we treat any information we collect about you. To help us make the Site more personal and valuable to you and to allow us to determine the efficiency of our interface design and navigation, as well as determine which of the products and services we offer appeal to you most, we collect certain anonymous information.  But, it is also necessary for us to collect certain personal information, and we respect and protect your right to privacy as set forth in our Privacy Policy. 

To ensure transparency with respect to our systems, methods, and policies we not only identify for you the type of data and information we collect from visitors and how we use and disclose it, along with the important steps we take to protect your privacy, we also want to be sure you agree with this Privacy Policy.  
**  
OUR COMMITMENT**  
We respect and take steps to protect the privacy of our Site's users. We strive to take reasonable care of information we may receive from you.

**ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**  
By accessing and continuing to use the Site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our privacy statement and freely and expressly consent to the information collection, storage, disclosure and use practices described in our Privacy Policy statement.  
**  
PARTICIPATING VENDOR-PARTNER POLICIES**  
Web sites that may be linked to or from this Web site (including any services and offerings with links to or from this Web site), or Web sites otherwise affiliated with our sites, may have their own privacy statements. Our Vendor-Partners and others who participate in this site's services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude toward consumer privacy.  We recommend that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT**  
We collect certain information from and about our users in three ways (in addition to the usage tracking described below): directly from our Web Server logs, with “cookies,” and from users.

    •  **Web Server Logs.** When you visit our Web site, we may collect and track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of   
       information we may track include:  
        •  Your Internet protocol (IP) address  
        •  The kind of browser or computer you use  
        •  Number of links you click within the site  
        •  State or country from which you accessed the site  
        •  Date and time of your visit  
        •  Name of your Internet service provider  
        •  Web page from which you linked to our site  
        •  Pages you viewed on the site

    •  **Use of Cookies.** We may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk   
       by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and   
       can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience   
       feature to save you time. For example, if you navigate within the Site and create a shopping cart, a cookie helps our Site recall the items placed in   
       your cart for subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases Site navigation by providing and saving your   
       preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality. We reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics with   
       partner companies, but do not allow other companies to place cookies on this Web site unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value.   
       You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser   
       setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on   
       our Site.

      •  **User's Personal Information.**   For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is any information that identifies you, would enable   
       someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with us. This includes: name, address, e-mail, telephone number or facsimile number,   
       account number, credit card information, military and other government-issued identification cards and other relevant information we use to verify   
       your qualifications to become a Site member, conduct a transaction, deliver products and services, administer individual accounts, provide   
       customer support, communicate with you regarding promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may be of interest to you. While you are   
       not required to submit any information to our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you will not be able to register and become a   
       Member of the Site nor access or view product prices, conduct transactions and we may not be able to provide you with certain other services. We   
       will not disclose personally identifiable information that we collect from you to third parties (including our Vendor-Partners) without your permission,   
       except to the extent necessary to:

        •  To fulfill your service/order requests   
        •  Communicate with you  
        •  To protect ourselves from liability  
        •  To respond to legal process or comply with law, or  
        •  Consummate a merger, acquisition, liquidation or other material corporate transaction affecting us or the Site.

  Please note that we reserve the right to investigate, ourselves or through appropriate third parties, complaints or violations of our Terms of Use or other policies or of applicable law, rule or regulation, and to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to, reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators or other third parties and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile(s), e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses and traffic information.

**USAGE TRACKING**  
We may employ certain technologies that allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site. Some of these tracking technologies may be placed or used by third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, design interface or quantify usage or Site traffic. We prohibit the use of technologies to surreptitiously collect or access your personal information.

We may track non-personal information about your visit, including the domain name and the name of the Web page from which you entered our Site, how much time you spent on each of our pages, and the IP address associated with your computer. We may, or we may engage the service of third parties to, also use certain technologies that allow us to count users who have visited certain pages. We use all of this information to improve the performance and operation of the Site.  

**PUBLIC FORUMS**  
Any information you submit on the Site as a review, testimonial or other posting or in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or social network) is not private and can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.  Please see item 7 of the GovX Terms of Use.

  **SECURITY**  
We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect your information. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We take reasonable, appropriate steps to protect against unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, personal information. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, we cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any firewalls or secure server software we may employ. Our employees who handle confidential or proprietary information belonging to us or our customers and Site members must treat it accordingly and are instructed not disclose it to unauthorized third parties.

**CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**  
California law permits residents who have provided personal information to us to request information about disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is to not disclose personal information collected online or otherwise for any third party's direct marketing purposes without first obtaining the user's consent. As an additional measure, users may contact us at info@govx.com to request information about disclosure of personal information and that their account records be noted that they have specifically opted-out of such disclosures. 

**YOUR INFORMATION AND PRFERENCES**  
You may view, change and correct your personal information and account preferences, including choosing to opt-out of e-mails from us, at any time by accessing your account or contacting us at: Contact us.

**CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT**  
We reserve the right, from time-to-time and without advance notice (although we will provide a “Last Revised” date upon any revision), to update this Privacy Statement to ensure that we continue to serve the best interests of our Site users and Vendor-Partners. We encourage you to review this Statement periodically to stay informed about our information collection and use practices and how we are helping protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of our service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
