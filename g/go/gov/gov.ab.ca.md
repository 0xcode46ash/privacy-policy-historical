# Privacy Statement - Government of Alberta

**April 24, 2003**

The Government of Alberta maintains this web site to help the public find information about the government, its programs, and its services. The Public Affairs Bureau, which publishes and maintains the main Government of Alberta web site, is committed to ensuring your privacy while you visit the site. 

The Government of Alberta web site connects you to the ministries and organizations that make up the Government of Alberta. This privacy statement covers the main Government of Alberta web site (available at [www.gov.ab.ca/home](http://www.gov.ab.ca/home)) not the web sites of individual departments. 

Each ministry's or organisation's web site may have a different privacy statement depending on the nature of its site. You should review the privacy statement each time you submit personal information on a web site. 

When you visit this web site, our web server automatically collects a limited amount of standard information essential to the operation and evaluation of the Government of Alberta web site. This information includes: 

  * the page from which you arrived, 
  * the date and time of your page request, 
  * the IP address your computer is using to receive information, 
  * the type and version of your browser, and 
  * the name and size of the file you request. 



This information helps us assess our information services and is used only for this purpose. It is collected in compliance with section 33 of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act. 

This information is not used to identify individuals who come to the web site. None of this information is disclosed to other public bodies or individuals. 

The only information collected that is used to identify you is information you give voluntarily. When you submit a question or comment, you may be asked for your name, e-mail address, or other information. When you sign up to receive an e-mail update of Government of Alberta news releases, you will be asked for your e-mail address. 

This information is only used to process and respond to your question or comment, or to provide the e-mail update service, and is collected in compliance with section 33 of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act. This information is not disclosed except to authorized personnel who need it to answer your question or who manage the e-mail update list. 

The personal information you submit is secure once it reaches the government server. In transit between your computer and the server, however, it may not be secure. If you would prefer to raise a comment or question in person, please call Alberta Connects at 310-4455 toll free in the province of Alberta.
