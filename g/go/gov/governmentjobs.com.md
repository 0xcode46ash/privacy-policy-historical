**Information About You Specifically**

In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, E-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc.  We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.

**General Information Disclosure**

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to GovernmentJobs.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, E-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded registration page, such as that of a GovernmentJobs.com and partner company-sponsored contest, then your information becomes the property of both GovernmentJobs.com and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, GovernmentJobs.com is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives.

**Resumes**

Since GovernmentJobs.com is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are several ways of doing this. You may store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but agencies will not have access to search it through our resume database product. Or, you can store it in our database and allow it to be searchable. If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all agencies with access to our resume database product will have access to your resume. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to human resource professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned and paying for the service, evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, agencies who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.
