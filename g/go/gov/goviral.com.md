anything else about who you are.
We use this information for the following general purposes:
        to build up an opinion about what kind of content you want to see so that we

        in an aggregated form with other data from other users to give us useful
        information about visitors to our site and users of our player.

court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction or if we receive a properly authorised
request from a law enforcement agency or if we need to do so to provide our service to
you or if you are participating in the Abuse Process.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Typically we will only do
so if:
        we have got something wrong and need to correct it;
        the law has changed and we need to react to the change;
        we have changed our service and the changes need to be reflected in this Privacy
        Policy
