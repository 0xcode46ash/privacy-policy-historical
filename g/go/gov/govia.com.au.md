  * Australian Standard 4721:2000 – _Personal Privacy Practices for the Electronic Tolling Industry_.   
 



The primary purpose for which we use your personal information is to calculate and collect the tolls, fees and charges prescribed by law or otherwise payable and, if you have an account with or pass issued by us, to manage your account or pass in accordance with the provisions of our Customer Services Agreement.

Unless you opt out (which you may do by notifying us at any time), we may also use information related to you and your travel on our roads for our traffic planning and management and market research and we may notify you of new products or services, changes to our Customer Services Agreement, changes to or discontinuance of our products or services and changes to conditions for the use of our roads.

If you wish to opt out, you may elect to do so on our application form or, at any time, by using our unsubscribe facility.

By visiting our website and/or providing personal information to us, you consent to our use of your personal information in the manner outlined in our Privacy Policy unless you tell us to the contrary by following the instructions contained on our website or by contacting our Privacy Officer.

**go via Account customers**

Where you have an account with us, we need the personal details, which you provide on your application form for the following purposes:

1.    to verify your identity;

2.    to obtain identifying particulars of your vehicle;

3.    to open an account for you;

4.    to send you an account card (if you have not authorised automatic top-ups) and any tags you request;

5.    to return the tags to you if they are lost, mislaid or stolen and are later returned to us;

6.    to contact you if there is any problem with your tags or your account;

7.    to conduct relevant and appropriate checks for creditworthiness and for fraud;

8.    to manage and administer your use of our roads (and the use of your tags on other toll roads) and to collect the tolls, fees and charges due;

9.    to respond to any query you may have and to process any payment you wish to make to us or to process any refund due to you;

10.   to notify you of new products or services, changes to our Customer Service Agreement, changes to or discontinuance of any of our products or services and changes to conditions for the use of our roads;

11.   to conduct research about our products and services and traffic conditions; and

12.   for traffic planning and vehicle management services.

The type of personal information that our staff will collect from you includes:

  * your name and contact details;
  * your vehicle details, including your vehicle Licence Plate Number (LPN);
  * your credit card details where payment is made by credit card or where a ‘top-up’ facility is paid by credit card or your bank account details where ‘top-up’ payments are paid by direct debit to a nominated bank account;
  * images of your motor vehicle (including your LPN);
  * if you have a tag, your tag details; and
  * images of motor vehicles generally which are taken as part of our monitoring of traffic flow and incidents which occur on our motorways.



**go via Pass customers**

Where you have a pass issued by us but do not have an account with us, we will collect and hold the following personal information to enable us to carry on our business as toll road operator:

  * your name and contact details (for post-paid passes);
  * your vehicle details including your vehicle LPN;
  * images of your motor vehicle including your LPN; and
  * images of motor vehicles generally which are taken as part of our monitoring of traffic flow and incidents which occur on our motorways.



**Other users of our toll roads**

Where you use our toll roads but do not have an account with us or a pass issued by us, we will collect and hold the following personal information to enable us to carry on our business as toll road operator:

  * images of your motor vehicle (including your LPN);
  * if you have a tag supplied by another toll road operator, your tag details; and
  * images of motor vehicles generally which are taken as part of our monitoring of traffic flow and incidents which occur on our motorways.



**Imaging**

Our tolling system will take images of your vehicle as it travels through toll points on our roads. We will use these images to classify your vehicle, and to identify the toll to be charged if a tag is not fitted, so that we can process tolls, fees and charges against your account or pass.

If you do not have a valid **go via** account or pass or an equivalent arrangement with another toll road operator and do not pay the applicable tolls, fees and charges when we request that we do so, these images may be passed to a Government agency as required or authorised by or under law, or as otherwise authorised, so that appropriate enforcement action may be taken.

We use closed circuit cameras to monitor traffic conditions and incidents on our motorways, and webcams to provide information to the general public about traffic conditions.

**Cookies**

Cookies are generally not used on our websites.

**Retention and release of personal information**

Your personal information (including photographs of your vehicle) is kept for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was obtained or as otherwise required by law. We take appropriate measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when its retention is no longer required. The types of measures we take vary with the type of information, and how it is collected and stored.

Your personal information (including images of your vehicle) is only released to third parties:

where we are authorised or required to release it by law; or

  * as disclosed under our Privacy Policy or this Privacy Statement; or
  * where you have consented to the release of information; or
  * where disclosure is otherwise permitted under any privacy law.



**Post-paid accounts**

If you submit an application for a post-paid account, you agree (or are deemed to have agreed) that we will not give you access to any reports we receive from any referees you nominate or to any details of our evaluation processes in deciding whether to offer a post-paid account to you.

Accessing and correcting personal information Queensland Motorways takes reasonable care to ensure that all the personal information we collect and use is accurate, complete, up-to-date and protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
