In some circumstances, Transurban Queensland may collect your personal information from third parties, including the Department of Transport and Main Roads. Where this occurs, we ensure that we act in accordance with relevant laws.  
 

If you do not provide Transurban Queensland with personal information, we may be unable to supply you with products or services.

**Disclosure of personal information**

In order to provide you with the products or services you request, Transurban Queensland may disclose your personal information to Transurban Queensland’s consultants, contractors and service providers performing services for Transurban Queensland including (but not limited to) debt recovery, credit reporting, mail-house, email distribution, legal and accounting, call centre operators and information technology service providers.  
 

If your personal information is collected by one entity in the Transurban Queensland group of entities, it may also be disclosed to other Transurban Queensland group entities. By disclosing personal information to any entity in the Transurban Queensland group, you consent to all other Transurban Queensland  group entities using that personal information for the purposes described above under the heading ‘Collection of personal information’.

  * you have authorised Transurban Queensland to do so;
  * your safety, or the safety of others in the community, is at risk; or

If Transurban Queensland provides your personal information to a third party, Transurban Queensland generally requires the third party to protect your personal information in the same way Transurban Queensland does.
