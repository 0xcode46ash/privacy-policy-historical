For example, the information you provide when you register online or update your account, log-in, place an order or make a return with us (online, via phone, mail, email, fax or catalog), communicate online with our customer service representatives, opt-in to receive emails, opt-in to receive mobile messages or social media notifications from us, shop online, request a catalog or other content and communications from us, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey, join our social networking sites, interact with our mobile sites or mobile applications, work with our sales representatives to purchase items not available on our websites, use one of our social media services (i.e., GovMint.com’s Facebook page or YouTube channel), or when you contact us with a comment, question or complaint.

In order to serve you better, we may combine information you give to us on this Site with information you give to us through our catalog, mailings, mobile messaging, or telephone communications. We may also supplement the information we collect through this Site with information that is publicly available (such as information based on your zip code) and information we receive from or cross-reference with our Marketing Partners.

When you visit our websites we may also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, location, date/time stamp and clickstream data. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.

Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to GovMint.com. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf.

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.

When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This GovMint.com-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is only saved in this GovMint.com-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.

If you register with us, this GovMint.com-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you.
