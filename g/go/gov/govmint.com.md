GovMint.com knows that you care how your personal information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so with sensitivity to your needs and desires. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting GovMint.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

 **What Personal Information About Customers Does GovMint.com Gather?**   
The information we learn from our customers helps us personalize and improve your shopping experience with GovMint.com. Here are the types of information we gather.  
  
---  
 **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information that you enter on our Web site or give to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  
  
---  
 **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from GovMint.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.  
  
---  
 **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  
  
---  
 **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of GovMint.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.  
  
---  
 **Protection of GovMint.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GovMint.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.  
  
---  
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.  
  
---  
 **How Secure Is Information About Me?**   
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.  
  
---  
 **Which Information Can I Access?**   
GovMint.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with GovMint.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.  
  
---  
 **What Choices Do I Have?**   
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of GovMint.com.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us at 1 (800) 721-0320 or email [customerservice@GovMint.com](mailto:customerservice@GovMint.com).
