GovMint.com knows that you care how your personal information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so with sensitivity to your needs and desires. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting GovMint.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

Types of personal information we collect  
We collect and store personal information that you give us when you register on our website, submit an application, request a catalog, place an order, enroll in a promotional or rewards program, call us, or send us a letter or e–mail. This information may include your name, mailing address, e–mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. If you respond to a sweepstakes or contest, we will ask you to verify that you are old enough to participate. 

How we use and share personal information  
We use the personal information we collect to process your orders, identify you within our systems, contact you if we have questions about your order, and notify you about new services or special promotional programs. 

We share your personal information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf (for example, credit card companies, financial institutions, shipping companies, printing houses, consultants and advisors, market research firms and rebate processors) and when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, injury, or harm to persons or property, to protect our rights or the rights of others, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or as otherwise required by law. We limit the scope of the information provided to third parties, and we allow its use only for the purposes for which it was disclosed. Personal information may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any Govmint.com business or asset to which the information pertains. 

Special information for Govmint.com shoppers  
If you shop with us online, we use third–party advertising technology to help us improve our marketing efforts. This technology uses non–personally identifiable information about your visits to Govmint.com and the sites upon which we advertise. We use Omniture, a service provider, to assist us with data collection and reporting. As part of that process, a "cookie" may be placed on your browser. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer's hard drive. They allow us to track your movement through our site, which gives us the opportunity to make the site more user-friendly. Omniture does not have the right to use the information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For more information, including how to opt–out, go to http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout or [click here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout).
