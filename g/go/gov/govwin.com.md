# Deltek Legal Notices and Privacy Statements

## I. Purpose

Deltek, together with its affiliated companies ("Deltek"), respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this Privacy Statement and with applicable law. This Privacy Statement covers the Personal Data collection, use and disclosure practices of Deltek websites, products and services that link to this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement does not cover our Kona or GovWin offerings, which can be found at [www.kona.com](http://www.kona.com/ "Kona.com") and [www.govwin.com](http://www.govwin.com/ "GovWin.com").

"Personal Data" is any information that identifies or can reasonably be used to identify a natural person.

This Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of:

  1. how Deltek processes, discloses and transfers your Personal Data;
  2. your choices with regard to how Deltek will use or disclose your Personal Data; and
  3. your other rights with regard to your Personal Data.



This Privacy Statement complies with the Safe Harbor Principles as agreed by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, Deltek adheres to these Safe Harbor Principles, which can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

## II. Scope 

This Privacy Statement does not cover data from which individual persons cannot be identified, or situations in which pseudonyms are used. (The use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is not possible). 

## III. Collection and Use of Personal Data

Deltek may receive Personal Data: (1) directly from you, (2) from an affiliated company or (3) through information that Deltek collects as you navigate through a Deltek website or service, including usage details, IP addresses and cookies. 

Deltek uses your Personal Data for business purposes, including without limitation: (1) order and service fulfillment; (2) customer service; (3) product improvement; (4) storing and processing data, including Personal Data, in computer databases and servers; (5) implementing and maintaining Deltek's information technology; and (6) for other business-related purposes permitted and/or required under applicable local law and regulation. If Deltek intends to use your Personal Data for any purpose not described in this Privacy Statement, Deltek will seek your prior consent.

## IV. Disclosures/Onward Transfers of Personal Data 

Deltek discloses your Personal Data only to those who reasonably need to know such data for a legitimate business purpose, and Deltek requires any third party to whom such disclosures are made to abide by confidentiality obligations. Absent your consent, Deltek will disclose your Personal Data only to service providers who perform tasks on Deltek's behalf and their contractors, provided that such service providers or contractors either: (a) comply with the Safe Harbor principles or use another mechanism permitted by the EU Data Protection laws and the applicable laws of other countries that impose international data transfer restrictions or (b) agree to provide adequate protections for your privacy interests that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Statement and to use the Personal Data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Deltek.

Deltek will not sell, rent, give away or otherwise distribute your Personal Data to anyone except as described above. Other than the disclosures described above, Deltek will disclose Personal Data only when required to do so by law, or when Deltek believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Deltek, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Deltek website or service and have supplied your email address, Deltek may, where permitted by law, occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with developments regarding Deltek and its products and services. If you send Deltek a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), Deltek reserves the right to publish it in order to help Deltek clarify or respond to your request or to help Deltek support other users. Deltek may disclose to third parties certain aggregated information collected about you and other users, but such information will not contain any personally identifiable information and your identity will be kept anonymous. 

## V. Sensitive Data 

"Sensitive Data" is data that pertains to a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, income records, health, sexual orientation or alleged commission of any offense. Deltek does not solicit Sensitive Data and will not disclose to any third party Sensitive Data that you have provided and will not use your Sensitive Data for any purpose other than (1) for the purpose for which you originally provided it, (2) for a purpose you later expressly consented to, or (3) where necessary to fulfill Deltek's legal obligations.

## VI. Confidentiality and Security of Data 

Deltek maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to secure your Personal Data and Sensitive Data and to prevent unauthorized access to such information. For more information about how Deltek protects your Personal Data and Sensitive Data, please contact us at [privacy@deltek.com](mailto:privacy@deltek.com).

## VII. Right to Access, Change or Delete Data 

Upon reasonable request and to the extent the request does not compromise the protections set forth in this Privacy Statement, Deltek allows you reasonable access to your Personal Data and Sensitive Data to correct, amend or delete such data. You should direct any such request to [privacy@deltek.com](mailto:privacy@deltek.com). 

Deltek will endeavor to respond in a timely manner to all reasonable written requests to view, modify or delete Personal Data or Sensitive Data.
