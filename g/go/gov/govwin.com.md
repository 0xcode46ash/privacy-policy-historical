# govWin

Your privacy is critically important to us. At govWin we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. 
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. 
  * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: govWin, Inc. (“govWin”) operates govWin.com. It is govWin’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, govWin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. govWin’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how govWin’s visitors use its website. From time to time, govWin may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

govWin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. govWin does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to govWin’s websites choose to interact with govWin in ways that require govWin to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that govWin gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask all visitors who sign up for a user account at govWin.com to provide a username and email address. govWin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

govWin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, govWin may monitor the most popular content contributions on the govWin.com site. govWin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, govWin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

govWin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on govWin’s behalf or to provide services available at govWin’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using govWin’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. govWin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, govWin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when govWin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of govWin, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an govWin website and have supplied your email address, govWin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with govWin and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. govWin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. govWin uses cookies to help govWin identify and track visitors, their usage of govWin website, and their website access preferences. govWin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using govWin’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of govWin’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, govWin may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in govWin’s sole discretion. govWin encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a govWin.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
