When you Register for an Account on GL’s website, you are prompted to provide the above-referenced data via a secure web form. All information is securely stored and can only be accessed by personnel via a username and password. 

This information is used for purposes verifying your identity, determining your eligibility to establish an account and contacting you regarding your account with us. We will also send you information regarding upcoming sales events, unique property offerings, and special announcements. If you choose, we will include information about specific property offerings that you designate when you register for an account with us. Finally, we ask about the size of your business in order to report our dealings with small businesses to our Government partner. Small business reporting to the Government does not include any specific customer information, only aggregate numbers. 

### Information We Collect When you Place a Bid on Our Website 

When you place a bid for a lot, GL collects the following additional information: 

  * Your name as it appears on your credit card 
  * Your valid credit card number 
  * The type of credit card (Visa™, MasterCard™ or American Express™) 
  * The expiration date of the credit card 
  * The billing address of the cardholder as it appears on your statement 
  * The Card Security Code (located on the back of the card within the signature block) 



This information is used for bidding authorization and billing purposes. We only charge your credit card when you have been declared the high bidder, and the sales event has closed. All information collected is protected by 128-bit encryption, the same security used by financial institutions to protect personal data. 

### Information We Collect from Buyers of Export-Restricted Property 

When you have been declared the high bidder on a Special Commodity sales event, GL collects information from you via the End-Use-Certificate application (DLA Form 1822), which can also be completed online via our **Forms** section (see “End-Use Certificate” form). The information collected via this form (whether completed online or hard copy) is shared with U.S. Government officials for the purpose of clearing purchasers of export-restricted property (Munitions List Items or Commerce Control List Items). Government Liquidation may also use this information for the purpose of collecting money due us in addition to satisfying the Government's requirement to control the sale of export-restricted property. 

### Information We Collect from All Persons Who Access Our Website 

Government Liquidation also collects information about your computer when you click on the GL web site.

## How does GL collect information about you? 

Most of the information GL collects about you is information that is voluntarily provided by you when you register for an account or place a bid in one of our sales events. Other information is available to us when you click on our site, and is collected electronically via our web engine. 

## Why do we collect personal information? 

GL collects personal information either for the purposes of establishing a business relationship (the information you give us when you register for an account on our web site), to collect payment for items you have bid on, to tailor the type of information that we provide to you regarding property that is available for purchase, or to meet a requirement established by the Government (i.e., EUC applications, FDA certificates or re-sale certificates). 

## How do we use the information we collect? 

Information collected by GL is used to communicate with you when we transact business. Whether it is to notify you that you have been awarded a lot, or to notify you that you have been outbid on an item, or to contact you regarding payment, we use the information provided by you to facilitate the transactions you wish to consummate with us. We do not sell customer information to third parties. GL verifies your personal information against a third-party vendor database, to which we provide some of your personal information for purposes of identity verification and purchase authorization. The identity verification and purchase authorization processes are automated with some manual overrides. Information provided via the “End-Use-Certificate” form and any supplemental requests pursuant to the processing of that form for the Government is used for the purpose of determining whether the Government will permit the sale of export-restricted property to an individual or entity, or to collect money owed the company by the individual or entity. We will not release your personal information to any third party without your consent, unless we are required to by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with an official investigation by a law enforcement organization. 

Government Liquidation may provide transaction-related information to Government or private auditors for the purpose of inspecting or validating our business practices, accounting records or financial reports. Any release of information for such a purpose will be done under standard confidentiality restrictions. 

## What steps do we take to secure your personal information? 

All employees having access to personal protected information must undergo Privacy Act training at least once a year and are monitored by management to ensure that adequate safeguards are used to protected the private information of our customers. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our site uses the standard SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption for all sensitive data that is transmitted over the Internet. This includes customers adding data to the web site, and employees transmitting data off the web site. No information, including the passwords that would give access to sensitive information ever flows over the Internet un-encrypted. 

## How can I protect my personal information? 

Never send credit card information via e-mail. Do not release information about your account to anyone who is not authorized by you to transact business with us on your behalf. Do not tell your password to anyone. Government Liquidation personnel will never ask you for your password as a means of verifying your identity. 

## How can I contact Government Liquidation about my personal information?

When contacting us about your personal information, please do not include your account password, credit card number, date of birth, driver license number, or social security number in any email to us.
