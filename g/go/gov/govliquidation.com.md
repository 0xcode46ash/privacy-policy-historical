# Government Liquidation Government Surplus Auctions Army Surplus Vehicles Sales

Government Liquidation, LLC, (GL) a wholly owned subsidiary of Liquidity Services, Inc. (LSI), wants you to know that we take your privacy very seriously. Because we do, we have developed the following privacy policy that states what information we collect, how that information is collected (whether it is by GL, its parent company, a vendor working for GL, or some other means), for what purposes we collect information, how that information is used, and under what circumstances that information would be released. Additionally, we want you to know when you have a choice regarding the collection or dissemination of any personal information, and how you can exercise your options. This privacy policy will also explain what steps Government Liquidation is taking to secure your private information and what steps you should take to safeguard that information. Finally, the privacy policy will tell you how to correct any inaccurate information, and who you can contact regarding questions about our privacy policy.

## What information does GL collect?

GL collects the following personal information from each person in order to establish an account with us: 

  * Your name 
  * Your company's name 
  * Your address, city, state and zip code 
  * Your country 
  * Your telephone number, secondary telephone and/or fax number 
  * Your email address 
  * Type of business 
  * Estimated annual surplus volume 
  * Primary FSC code category that you are interested in 
  * Number of employees that your company has 



This information is used for purposes of contacting you regarding your account with us. We will also send you information regarding upcoming sales events, unique property offerings, and special announcements. If you choose, we will include information about specific property offerings that you designate when you register for an account with us. Finally, we ask about the size of your business in order to report our dealings with small businesses to our Government partner.

When you place a bid for a lot, GL collects the following additional information: 

  * Your name as it appears on your credit card 
  * Your valid credit card number 
  * The type of credit card (Visa™, MasterCard™ or American Express™) 
  * The expiration date of the credit card 
  * The billing address of the cardholder as it appears on your statement 
  * The Card Security Code (located on the back of the card within the signature block) 



This information is used for billing purposes. We only charge your credit card when you have been declared the high bidder, and the sales event has closed. For Special Commodity sales events, the card will not be billed until the End-Use-Certificate application has been completed and approved by the Government.

When you have been declared the high bidder on a Special Commodity sales event, GL collects information from you via the End-Use-Certificate application (DLA Form 1822), which can also be completed online via our **Forms** section (see “End-Use Certificate” form). The information collected via this form (whether completed online or hard copy) is shared with U.S. Government officials for the purpose of clearing purchasers of restricted-end-use property (Munitions List Items or Commerce Control List Items). Government Liquidation does not use this information for any purpose other than to satisfy the Government's requirement to control the sale of restricted-end-use property.

Government Liquidation also collects information about your computer when you click on the GL web site. We log your IP address, browser type, access times, and referring site to help diagnose potential problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your user account. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your username so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. For our site to function properly, you need to have cookies enabled.

## How does GL collect information about you?

Most of the information GL collects about you is information that is voluntarily provided by you when you register for an account or place a bid in one of our sales events. Other information is available to us when you click on our site, and is collected electronically via our web engine.

## Why do we collect personal information?

GL collects personal information either for the purposes of establishing a business relationship (the information you give us when you register for an account on our web site), to collect payment for items you have bid on, to tailor the type of information that we provide to you regarding property that is available for purchase, or to meet a requirement established by the Government (i.e., EUC applications, FDA certificates or re-sale certificates).

## How do we use the information we collect?

Information collected by GL is used to communicate with you when we transact business. Whether it is to notify you that you have been awarded a lot, or to notify you that you have been outbid on an item, or to contact you regarding payment, we use the information provided by you to facilitate the transactions you wish to consummate with us. We do not sell customer information to third parties. We may allow third parties to send information to you when we believe that the information may be of interest to you, but we will not release your personal information to any third party without your consent, unless we are required to by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with an official investigation by a law enforcement organization.

Government Liquidation may provide transaction-related information to Government or private auditors for the purpose of inspecting or validating our business practices, accounting records or financial reports. Any release of information for such a purpose will be done under standard confidentiality restrictions.

## What steps do we take to secure your personal information?

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our site uses the standard SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption for all sensitive data that is transmitted over the Internet. This includes customers adding data to the web site, and employees transmitting data off the web site. No information, including the passwords that would give access to sensitive information ever flows over the Internet un-encrypted.

## How can I protect my personal information?

Never send credit card information via e-mail. Do not release information about your account to anyone who is not authorized by you to transact business with us on your behalf. Do not tell your password to anyone. Government Liquidation personnel will never ask you for your password as a means of verifying your identity.

## How can I correct inaccurate personal information?

Credit card information can be changed at the time you begin bidding in a sales event.
