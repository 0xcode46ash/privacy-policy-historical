# Welcome to GOQii Life

**Our Policy:**
* Welcome to the web site (the “Site”, which includes any mobile applications, mobile sites and tablet applications) of GOQii. (together with its successors and assigns, “GOQii”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by GOQii and has been created to provide information about our company, our mobile application and our services that help you shift to a healthier lifestyle with a combination of our advanced wearable technology (the “GOQii Band”), coaching and your karma (the “GOQii Services”) to our Site visitors (“you”, “your”). 

We know that the privacy of your personal information is very important to you. This Privacy Policy sets forth GOQii’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users.

**Information We Collect:**
* When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

#### Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: 

  * We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, collect, store or transfer data using the GOQii Band, post information or comments, respond to one of our surveys or questionnaires, register for access to GOQii Services, allow us to access your location information (such as by using the GPS on your mobile device or the GOQii Band), or use certain GOQii Services. Wherever GOQii collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of GOQii and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

#### Other Information: 

  *     * _Non-Identifiable Data:_

When you interact with GOQii through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our Site’s automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. GOQii may store such non-identifiable information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by GOQii affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. 

In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features. 

This Site may enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content. By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above. You can disable, delete and control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located [here](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html). If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on this Site.

This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and GOQii may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. GOQii may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
