##### What does Gourmandia.com do with the information it gathers and/or tracks? 

**Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising.** Gourmandia.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. Gourmandia.com also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners on our Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. This means that readers see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analysis and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information about you as an individual subscriber or registrant will not be provided to any third party, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, as described in our Terms and Conditions of Use.

Occasionally, Gourmandia.com shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the Gourmandia.com group of companies or third parties whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these mail or e–mail promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer or purchasing unique services. 

**Data Security.** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online, including security for credit card submissions.
