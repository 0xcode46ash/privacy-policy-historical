We use this aggregate information to analyse behaviour relating to our website generally. We may also share aggregate information with selected third parties, but we do not disclose your personal information.

(2) We use your IP address to help to identify you and to gather broad demographic information, help to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the website and for security reasons, such as fraud detection.

**5          Cookies **

(a) As with most other websites, we do use cookies which are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive which we use to

\- help us to distinguish visitors and identify whether you have visited the website previously, so that we can understand your browsing habits and make the experience as meaningful to you personally as is possible and to improve the website

\- deal with the administration of the website, to analyse and compile statistics about its use (e.g. how many visitors and which pages they visit) and to improve it. They are not used to read data from your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites.

(b) Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognise your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself, for example by registering with us or purchasing from us, then you remain anonymous to us. Cookies come in two types: session-based and persistent:

(i) Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer

(ii) Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. We use persistent cookies that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a website user or prior website user (whatever the case may be) and to track your use. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. These cookies expire after six months.

(c) Some cookies are essential for parts of the website to operate and have already been set. You can delete and block all cookies from our website but that means that some parts of the website will not work. Users who disable their web browser's ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website, but will not be able to successfully and completely use our websites and services.
