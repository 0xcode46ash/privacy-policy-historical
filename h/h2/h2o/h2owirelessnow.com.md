# H2O Wireless Terms and Conditions

Â  | 

**Sharing of Collected Information** H2O Wireless will only share certain information about you with those vendors who are responsible for providing our inventory or performing other necessary services that you require. We will not share your personally identifying information with other third parties without your consent, except for the following limited purposes:

  1. We are compelled to do so by law or by an order of a court or governmental authority. 
  2. In order to cooperate with law enforcement authorities or governmental regulatory bodies, and if we find any fraudulent activities. 
  3. As necessary to complete a transaction for you. 
  4. As we deem necessary to protect the rights, safety or property of ShopLocus.com, our users or others or to enforce our terms of use agreement or privacy policy. 



**Information Collected** To register on our website, you must submit your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. In addition, to purchase a calling card, prepaid wireless or other products we sell, you must submit additional information, including your credit card information. We will also ask you to go through VERID verification upon your first order with us. This required personally identifiable information is necessary for us to process transactions for you, protect you against credit card fraud and contact you. When you register with H2OWirelessNow.com, we will ask you for an "e-mail." The e-mail you select may appear on the website in connection with future services we provide. We will never share the information stored on that database, as well as other information we collect or you provide with any business partners or third parties, including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or which we believe may be of interest to you.

When you authorize a purchase transaction, we will collect certain information related to that transaction such as the location from which you are requesting the search or transaction, the product or service involved, the quantity or amount of the product or service and certain personally identifiable information, such as your password, your credit card information and any special handling requests. This personally identifiable information will never knowingly appear in public areas of our website.

During the processing of your transactions, we collect verification information from our credit card authorization services. Credit card authorization services verify that credit card information and address that they have on file for you matches the information that you have provided to us.

We collect general information about you when you visit our website. This information includes technical information related to your computer and the manner in which you are accessing our site and includes such information as the internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, what operating system your computer is using, what browser software (e.g., Explorer, Netscape or other) your computer is using, and who your Internet service provider is, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website from which you just came and the URL to which you go next and certain operating metrics, such as the amount of time you use our website.

The general information that we gather about you may be aggregated with general information of all users to help us better understand how our site is used. In addition, we aggregate the general information and the personal information. We compile and analyze this aggregated information so that we can provide more meaningful information to corporate partners and more relevant content and advertisements to you.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. If at any point we decide to disclose personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. You will be given t he choice at that time to "opt-out" of any disclosures of your personal information that you made available to us prior to the change in our policy.
