# Hello, H2O Wireless!!

**Information Collection and Use** Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier.

**Aggregate Data** We gather certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to this site. This information may include which URL you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your IP address. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, and do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you. This type of aggregated, non-personally identifiable information may also be collected by third parties that help us run our services. In addition, we aggregate data and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. 

**Personally Identifiable Information** We also request information about you, such as your name, address, phone number and email address ("personally identifiable information"). We seek such information to provide products and/or services that more closely reflect your preferences. In addition, we may use such information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and services. If you choose, we may use information to contact you and deliver information to you.

Generally, we only share personally identifiable information with other entities if you specifically agree to permit such sharing. However, unless you specifically decline, we may share personally identifiable information with certain third parties with whom we contract to provide services or jointly-branded products. By accepting this Privacy Policy or by purchasing or using our products or our jointly-branded products, you expressly agree to such sharing of information.

We may use third party service providers to facilitate our services and therefore we may provide some of your personally identifiable information directly to them. In addition, we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing Customer Care. They have access to personally identifiable information and may use it as needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose, except that they may aggregate your personally identifiable information with similar information of other customers in a manner that does not personally identify you.

Locus Telecommunications cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to liability.

**Cookies** "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive; each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser preferences allow it. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit web sites anonymously. Cookies assist us in providing customized services and can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Locus Telecommunications uses cookies, which tell us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. Locus Telecommunicationsâ€™ cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. Additionally, you may encounter cookies or other similar devices on our site that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. 

**Policy towards Children** Locus Telecommunications is concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. 

**Other Information Collectors** Except as otherwise expressly included in this privacy policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Since Locus Telecommunications does not control the privacy policies of third parties, some of whose services may be offered on our site, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

**Security** Locus Telecommunications uses standard industry practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. Locus Telecommunications treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. Please note that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. 

**Privacy Policy Changes** Locus Telecommunications may, from time to time, make changes to this policy, based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
