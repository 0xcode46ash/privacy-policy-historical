_High Country News_ is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We do collect some information about our users so we can better serve you.

### Website privacy

We use your computer's IP address to help diagnose problems with our site and to gather general demographic information. To get a better idea of who is using the site and how they are using it, we also use "cookies" - numbers that remain on your machine that tell us how often you visit the site, and what parts of the site you visit. We do not share this information with other organizations. Any information you enter into order forms (such as your phone number and credit card number and email address) remains confidential. When posting comments to  _HCN_ articles, please remember that any information you disclose in these areas is about to be posted publicly, so be cautious when disclosing any personal information. This site contains links to other sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

### Subscriber privacy

If you subscribe to the paper, you should know that we periodically exchange subscriber lists (physical mailing address only) with other like-minded non-profit groups. List exchanges are one of our most useful tools in spreading the word about  _HCN_ and boosting our circulation. However, you have the option at any time to ask that your name not be traded. [Contact circulation](https://www.hcn.org/feedback/contact-us "Contact Circulation") with your full name and address to be removed from list exchanges.

### Your email address

We use your email address for administrative purposes, such as notifying you about your subscription, to contact you about new products or upcoming events, to send you newsletters or other editorial content, donation appeals, and sponsored messages with offers from other organizations. In the case of our enewsletter, we NEVER trade your email address with other organizations. [Update your email preferences](https://www.hcn.org/subscriber-services/email-prefs?epl=) to receive only those emails you want from us. 

### Donor privacy

We NEVER sell, rent or trade donor information with other organizations.
