To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is collected by 

Flower of Life LLC and any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties without the customer's prior informed consent. Like most standard website servers, we use log files. Log files track anonymous user information including, but not limited to, Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The information tracked via log files is not linked to personally identifiable information except for IP addresses and source URL. 

 **2\. Cookies**  
The Website uses "cookies" to assign unique identifiers to your computer. The cookies we use are persistent files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may be used to help save information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are not required to reenter information each time that you visit the Website, and to deliver content specific to your interests. 

 **3\. How We Use Your Information**  
Any personal information that you supply to us remains your personal property. However, by submitting that information to 

Flower of Life LLC, you grant us the right to use your personal information for any legal purpose including, without limitation: a) providing promotional offers to you via email advertising and/or online banner advertising; b) transferring the personal information that you provided to a third party, when necessary, to receive a product, service, or information that you may have requested from such third party while using the Website; c) tracking compliance with our Terms and Conditions; and d) for validation, suppression, content improvement and feedback purposes. By submitting your information to the Website, you grant Flower of Life LLC the right to use that information for marketing purposes, and agree to receive email marketing from the Website. We may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. In order to end your email subscription to a particular list, you must follow the instructions contained in any email correspondence that you receive from Flower of Life LLC. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe you from all email lists. We only send email marketing to individuals that have agreed, whether by visiting this Website or through third party websites, to receive email marketing from Flower of Life LLC or its affiliates and partners. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may be required to disclose personal information in some instances, such as: 1) when required by law wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or subpoena; 2) in the event that Flower of Life LLC is sold or acquired; or 3) in the event that we believe   
that the Website is being, or has been, used in violation of our terms and conditions or to commit unlawful acts.

Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR. Flower of Life LLC is not responsible for any content, terms and conditions, or the privacy policies of any third party advertisers' websites.
