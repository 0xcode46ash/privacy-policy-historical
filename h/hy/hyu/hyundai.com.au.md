# Privacy - Hyundai Motor Company Australia

At Hyundai Motor Company Australia Pty Limited ABN 58 008 995 588 ("Hyundai", "we", "us" or "our"), we recognize the importance of your privacy and appreciate that your personal information is very important to you. We are committed to complying with our obligations under the National Privacy Principles ("NPP") as set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). References to "personal information" in this Privacy Policy means information or an opinion that identifies an individual or from which a person's identity can be ascertained. 

This Privacy Policy sets out key information regarding our collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personal information, and of your ability to access and correct it. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Please check our Privacy Policy regularly for updates.

## 1\. Collection

Hyundai and our authorised Hyundai dealers collect personal information from you in a variety of ways, including when you:

  * purchase a new or used Hyundai vehicle, part or accessory from an authorised Hyundai dealer;
  * make an enquiry about our Hyundai vehicles, parts, accessories or services;
  * request a brochure, specification sheet, information or other materials about our Hyundai vehicles, parts, accessories or services;
  * arrange finance for the purchase of your Hyundai vehicle;
  * take a test drive at an authorised Hyundai dealer;
  * take your Hyundai vehicle to be serviced or repaired at an authorised Hyundai dealer;
  * enter a Hyundai trade promotion; or
  * Wparticipate in a Hyundai marketing, product development, profiling, survey or research campaign.



Our authorised Hyundai dealers will share personal information they collect from you with us. We may also collect your personal information from third parties, including our service providers, contractors and agents. If we are unable to collect personal information we require, we may not be able to do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

We mainly collect information about your contact details (including your name, address, email, phone, mobile and fax numbers). However, there will be circumstances where we may require other personal information from you, such as a copy of your driver's licence if you participate in a test drive or your financial information if you are seeking finance for the purchase of your Hyundai vehicle. If you register with myHyundai, we may collect information from you about your hobbies, favourite sports and other interests, if you choose to give us that information, which we may use to make you offers or invite you to events which we think could be of interest to you. Other aggregate but non-personally identifiable information may also be collected, such as demographic information about your age, gender and occupation. This information will in no way personally identify you and is used in an aggregate form to help improve our products and services. 

## 2\. Use 

We collect your personal information to ensure we deliver quality products and services to our customers and potential customers. To achieve this, we may use your personal information for a number of purposes including: 

  * to respond to your enquiries about our Hyundai vehicles, parts, accessories or services; 
  * to process sales orders, and administer accounts and warranty records; 
  * to provide you and our authorised Hyundai dealers with necessary support; 
  * to attend to the servicing or repair of your Hyundai vehicle; 
  * for product development, market research, and other marketing and promotional activities; 
  * to carry out our legal compliance obligations, such as to conduct a product safety recall where necessary. 



We may use your personal information for the primary purpose for which it is collected. For example, to respond to your enquiries about the specifications of a Hyundai vehicle, or to contact you if you are a winner of a Hyundai trade promotion. We may also use your personal information for related secondary purposes that you would reasonably expect, such as sending you mail or emails with details of new Hyundai vehicles or services, special offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. You can contact us at any time if you do not wish to receive marketing material. 

## 3\. Disclosure 

Hyundai and our authorised Hyundai dealers share personal information, so we may disclose your personal information to our authorised Hyundai dealers and vice versa. We may also disclose your personal information to our employees, officers, contractors, agents, related bodies corporate and affiliated companies within Hyundai Motor Group in Korea, and service providers who need to work closely with our database to complete their work for us (such as mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters, printers for marketing material, roadside assistance service providers, IT database service providers or the financier). We will require our service providers to keep your personal information confidential and not to use or disclose it for any purpose other than the purpose of performing their work for us. 

We may also disclose your personal information where you consent to us doing so or as is otherwise allowed or required by law. 

## 4.Storage and security 

Security of your personal information is important to us and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

Your personal information is stored within secured premises by Hyundai Motor Group or its subsidiary companies in Korea. The storage facility has physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We have also taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which has been transferred to Korea will not be held, used or disclosed inconsistently with the NPPs. 

## 5\. Access & Correction 

You may seek access to your personal information which we hold about you and we will provide you with access in accordance with the NPPs. We may require that you provide suitable identification for security purposes before allowing you to access your personal information. We may also charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you. Access to your personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will give you reasons why. 

We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date. If you become aware that any personal information which we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or not up to date, please contact us using our details below to correct or update your personal information.
