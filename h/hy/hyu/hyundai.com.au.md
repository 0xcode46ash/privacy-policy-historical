# Privacy - Hyundai Motor Company Australia

Hyundai Motor Company Australia Pty Ltd (ABN 58 008 995 588) and its affiliates, (collectively referred to herein as "HMCA", "we", "us", or "our") take care to respect customers' right to privacy and to fully comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act). We use any information we collect about customers only in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the Act to provide a more customised service experience. Please read on for more detail about our Privacy Policy.

## Hyundai Customer Privacy Policy

While information is an important element in our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our customers' trust. Keeping customer information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at HMCA. 

  * We will safeguard, according to strict legal standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us. 
  * We will limit the collection and use of customers' information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer and improve our business and products by incorporating customer suggestions and feedback. 
  * Only authorised employees, authorised Hyundai dealers, and contracted personnel, who are trained in the proper and lawful handling of customers' information, to have access to and use of customers' information. From time to time Hyundai may form relationships with other organisations to bring you special offers, competitions, surveys and subscriptions. For any third party offer or subscription, we require as a matter of policy that the third party clearly states its intentions with any information gathered, and attaches its privacy policy to the offer or subscription. We also require that the terms and conditions of the offer should also be clearly stated. Further, Hyundai takes its obligations to protect customer information very seriously and we make every effort to deal only with suppliers who share and demonstrate this same attitude. 
  * Other than disclosure under clause 3, customers' information is only disclosed to external organisations when we contract with them to conduct business on our behalf or to provide support services to customers relating to Hyundai products. We only make such disclosures when those organisations comply with our Privacy Policy. These organisations are not permitted to retain any customers' information after they have completed their contracted obligations. 
  * We, our agents, and Hyundai dealers may use personal information to inform our customers about our products and services or promotions that we think may be of interest to our customers. We will give an opportunity to our customers to express their wish not to receive any direct marketing communications. At any time, customers can let us know if they no longer wish to receive marketing materials by contacting our Privacy Officer and we will remove their details from our direct marketing database. However, if the law requires us to provide customers with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if the customers have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally. 
  * We will strive to keep customers' files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. The accuracy of that information however, depends to a large extent on the information the customers provide. We will therefore from time-to-time give an opportunity to customers to update any changes to their personal information to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, complete and up to date. If customers find out the information we hold is incorrect, customers should also contact us immediately so we can promptly amend our records. 
  * We will continuously assess our performance against our Privacy Policy standards to ensure that customers' privacy is respected and ensured. 
  * The customers have a right to request access to personal information that we hold about them. Where an individual believes his/her personal information is not accurate, they may request correction by HMCA by contacting us. 
  * We are entitled to amend or modify our Privacy Policy at any time. Nothing contained in this policy is intended to create contractual rights and obligations.
