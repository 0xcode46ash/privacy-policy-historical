About this privacy statement  
This Internet Privacy Statement applies to your use of the HMCA web site, at www.hyundai.com.au.  
HMCA is committed to user privacy in respect of our products and services, and guards your data carefully. The online environment provides an unprecedented access to information, but the convergence of communication and information technologies also brings a range of information privacy issues to the centre of public concern.  
At HMCA, we take care to respect your right to privacy and to fully comply with our obligations under the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (C'th). HMCA can only obtain personal information from you via this site if you choose to supply it to us by entering your information in the appropriate locations herein.

Your consent  
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by HMCA. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. You are under no obligation to provide us with your personal information. If you choose to do so, it will be accepted as your consent for us to collect and use it as described below. If you do supply your personal information, or if you allow us to obtain it from you by the methods described below, we will treat your information as confidential in accordance with HMCA's Public Privacy Policy. A copy of that comprehensive policy can be obtained by e-mailing HMCA at: [privacy@cyclecarriage.com.au](mailto:privacy@cyclecarriage.com.au?subject=Privacy%20Statement%20Inquiry)

Personal information collected  
The types of personal information that we collect from you will depend on how you use the www.hyundai.com.au web site. For example, when requesting additional information not readily available on the web site, we will collect details such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, postal code, age, gender, and some details of your personal interests, your preferences for receiving commercial e-mail and receiving market research surveys via e-mail. Some of this information is essential for us to be able to accurately identify who is using the service. If you do not provide this information to us we will not be able to provide the additional information you have requested.  
For statistical purposes, we collect de-identified information on web site activity (such as the number of users who visit the web site from another site, the address of that site) through the use of "cookies".

Cookies  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies only contain de-identified information, but they do enable us to provide features such as storing items of interest to users of our web site between visits. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.  
Cookies help us provide a better user experience by measuring which Web site areas are of greatest interest to visitors to our web site. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our Web site. Some Web sites will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled.  
From time to time, HMCA may provide aggregated statistical information about sales, browsing patterns and navigation techniques to reputable third parties. This is de-identified information, and assists HMCA to improve products and services offered.

Use and disclosure of personal information  
Unless you have instructed us not to do so, personal information may be shared with related companies within HMCA, where it will remain confidential. HMCA undertakes not to sell, rent or trade your personal information. We will not disclose information about you unless the disclosure is:  


  * Required by law
  * Is authorised by law
  * You have consented to our disclosing the information about you
  * To a HMCA dealer where you have requested particular information (such as pricing or availability of vehicles)

From time to time HMCA may form relationships with other organisations to bring you special offers, competitions, surveys and subscriptions. For any third party offer or subscription, we require as a matter of policy that the third party clearly states its intentions with any information gathered, and attaches its privacy policy as a hyperlink to the offer or subscription. We also require that the terms and conditions of the offer should also be clearly stated.   
Further, HMCA takes its obligations to protect client information very seriously and we make every effort to deal only with suppliers who share and demonstrate this same attitude.

Security of your personal information  
In accordance with its Public Privacy Policy, HMCA has implemented strict procedures and systems designed to protect the security of your personal information. HMCA honours your choice for its intended use. Our aim is to carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.  
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date.  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Whilst we strive to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our online products or services sites. You conduct these activities at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security.

Children’s privacy  
We do not market children or knowingly collect personal information about children without parental consent.  
Children should always ask a parent before sending any transmission over the Internet. Whilst HMCA will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy and other rights are not compromised, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's Internet usage.
