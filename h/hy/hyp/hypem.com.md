The best place to find new music on the web. Every day, thousands of people around the world write about music they love â€” and it all ends up here. 

## PRIVACY POLICY

The Hype Machine Inc. ("Hype Machine") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Hype Machine website located at http://hypem.com (the "Site"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Hype Machine's treatment of personal information that Hype Machine gathers when you are on the Site and when you use Hype Machine's services (the "Services"). This policy also covers Hype Machine's treatment of any personal information that Hype Machine's business partners share with Hype Machine.

This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Hype Machine does not own or control, or to individuals that Hype Machine does not employ or manage.

### What Personal Information About Customers Does Hype Machine Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our users:

### Information You Provide to Us

We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our Site's features. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content and advertising you see, and communicating with you about specials, surveys and new products and services. In order for you to use our Site, you are not required to register; however, you must register to take advantage of certain features of the Site, such as bookmarking favorites and other information to appear on your dashboard and receiving e-mail newsletters from us. To register, you must provide your e-mail address, a username and a password. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is optional. You may also provide us with your e-mail address to be notified when new merchandise is available on the Site. If you wish to purchase merchandise from our Site, you must disclose certain billing and shipping information to our third-party service providers, including your name, address and information about your method of payment.

### Automatic Information

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Hype Machine automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Hype Machine cookie information, and the page you requested. Hype Machine uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal web experience.

### E-mail Communications

We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Hype Machine if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also send out e-mails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please contact us at privacy@hypem.com.

### Information From Other Sources

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Like the information you provide to us, we do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing you with our Service. We may also receive delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources to facilitate delivery of your purchases.
