# Privacy policy | Hyper Island

_Last revised: Jun 30, 2016._

Our Privacy Policy outlines usage of your data, technology aspects, cookie use and third party disclosure on this site, hyperisland.com.

By visiting hyperisland.com you don’t disclose any personal data to Hyper Island. This requires an active action which can be made by filling out a contact or download form, buying a product, becoming a member of our community etc.

We use cookies for the site to enable us to gather statistics regarding usage to improve, develop, meet future needs and provide more personalised services to you, both on this website and through other media.

As a member of the Hyper Island online community, with an active profile, we need to use cookies to enable the technology that drives the community functionality.

All Hyper Island students and alumni exist in a internal database system which is used for authentication to activate user profiles. In this system, your name, email address and possibly more information is stored depending on what information has been shared with Hyper Island. On this site, you have the opportunity to enter more information which is stored in a database that drives the site.

You can opt out at any time.

## Measuring our visitors

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

You can learn more about [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) or [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) if you wish.

## Facebook, Twitter and other social networks

These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the “Like” and “Tweet” buttons.

To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it.

Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users.

## If you sign up for a service

When you sign up for any of our services – paid or otherwise – we will record specific personal information about you, such as your name and email address.

We will also collect and store information about your use of our services so as to improve them. For example, we keep a log of what features are being used at any time.

We also log account and transaction history for accounting purposes, and to monitor our business activities.
