# Privacy Policy - Hyperwallet Systems Inc.

This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you through your use of the payment processing application (the “ **Application** ”) available at [www.hyperwallet.com](http://www.hyperwallet.com/ "Hyperwallet Systems Inc.") (the “ **Site** ”) provided to you by Hyperwallet Systems, Inc. (referred to herein as “ **We** ” or “ **Us** ”).

By registering for the Application, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  1. **Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.** Information about you is collected directly from you through the Application. This information may include your name, home address, telephone number, personal e-mail address, your forwarding address (e.g. during a vacation), previous address(es), billing and account information (such as credit card, or bank account number), your mailing preferences, delivery instructions, transaction history, and service preferences as well as other information defined as non-public or private information about you pursuant to applicable law. In addition, from time to time, via the Application or otherwise, you may be asked to provide more detailed information regarding your interests, occupation and background. For example, sometimes users of the Application may be asked to complete surveys in order to get a better sense of who they are and what issues, products or services may be of interest to such users.


  2. **Use of Personally Identifiable Information Collected.** We may use personally identifiable information to process payment transactions, and to respond to your inquiries or requests. We may also use information that we collect to improve the Site and the Application, and for our analyses. We may remove the elements of your information that could identify you. We may use and disclose the resulting “de-identified” information without restrictions. For example, we may create de-identified, statistical, and aggregate data to prepare reports about the Application that do not identify any individual users. We may also use personally identifiable information: 
    1. to establish your identity and obtain contact information for you;
    2. to protect against error and fraud;
    3. to provide you with services to supplement the Application, which may be offered by Us, including any network partners;
    4. to develop and manage this Site and the Application;
    5. to distribute this Site’s newsletters and other material to individuals on this Site’s mail and e-mail lists, including via third party mailing houses and e-mail service providers;
    6. to understand and respond to your needs and preferences, including to contact and communicate with you and to conduct surveys, research and evaluations;
    7. to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activity, and to enforce this Site’s Terms of Use;
    8. to develop, enhance, market, sell or otherwise provide this Site’s products and services;
    9. as permitted by, and to comply with, any legal (including contractual) or regulatory requirements or provisions; and
    10. for any other purposes to which you consent.


  3. **Disclosure of Personal Information.** We may share personally identifiable information about you with the following parties for the purposes described below: 
    1. with our contractors and service providers who assist us in managing, administering or delivering the Application. We will require such parties to protect and govern the use of the information about you according to this Privacy Policy and other requirements that we place upon them by contract.
    2. with our subsidiaries or affiliates to provide joint content, products, and services.
    3. in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business, we may transfer the information about you, in which case we will require any such buyer or acquiring party to agree to treat the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    4. with law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties to: 
      1. respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations; or
      2. report suspected illegal or fraudulent activity, prevent physical harm or financial loss, and to investigate violations of this Privacy Policy, or the Site’s terms of use.

We will not sell or otherwise give information about you to other parties for their marketing purposes.

If you are known to us as a registered user of an online service, we may combine and store personal information about your use of this Site and the online information you have provided with certain other online and offline information already collected. All collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained through this Site shall be subject to this Privacy Policy and the applicable privacy laws.


  5. **Cross-Border Transfer.** Your personally identifiable information is stored in Canada, and may be stored and processed in any other country where we have service providers. By using the Application or by providing consent to us (where required by law), you agree to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.
