# Welcome to hyperWALLET!

Privacy

The only personally identifying piece of information that hyperWALLET stores is your e-mail address. All of your personal financial information is held at your bank, unless you choose to store information in your wallet. Of course, your e-Tailer will require shipping information or may require you to establish an account with them - that information is stored on their servers, not in your hyperWALLET. But we guarantee that they will not have access to any information related to your hyperWALLET (other than to confirm that your purchase has been paid for). If you elect to accept or make credit card payments (only available to eBay Auction users), you will be required to provide information to Beanstream Internet Commerce Inc., our credit card processing partner.

Security

hyperWALLET uses the strongest security technologies available to safeguard the confidentiality of your information. Our secure servers sit behind our firewalls, and use 128-bit SSL encryption, the same security standard used by most financial institutions. As long as you keep your Wallet ID number and password private, no one will be able to access your wallet.
