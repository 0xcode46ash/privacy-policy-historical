When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, or entering contests, Hyperic may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.

Hyperic collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Hyperic also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other Hyperic products and services.

When you submit personal information to Hyperic with respect to a particular activity, such as ordering a product, you understand and agree that in order to complete the activity and update related files, Hyperic and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may need to transfer, store, and process your information in any of the countries in which such entities maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Your personal information will not be transferred outside of the European Union for any other purpose unless you give your consent.
