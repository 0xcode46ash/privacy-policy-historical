# Hybrid Cars - Privacy Policy

  
Our privacy policy is in plain English (we hope) and will only take a few moments to read and understand: 

**How You Can Contact Us:  
**We can be reached via e-mail using our [Feedback Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051231171722id_/http%3A//www.hybridcars.com/feedback.html), or by sending mail directly to [info@hybridcars.com](mailto:info@hybridcars.com).

**Site Tracking**  
We have a simple web statistics program running that tracks how many times each page is visited. When you visit a page, information is logged that contains your domain name (aol.com, for example), date, time, and pages visited. There is no personally identifiable information. The information we collect is:

  * Used to improve the content on our site
  * Never shared with other organizations for commercial purposes



**Email Addresses**   
We log your email address in three situations:

Hybrid Cars Newsletter – We keep track of email addresses when people sign up for our newsletter. The email address you enter for the newsletter will never be sold or transferred to any other organization. You have the ability to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. The form for subscribing and unsubscribing to the newsletter are available [on this site](https://web.archive.org/web/20051231171722id_/http%3A//www.hybridcars.com/newsletter.html) and are included in every email that is sent out.

Email Page to a Friend - We log each time someone uses this feature to track how many times it is used, by whom, and from what page. We do this to make sure that someone doesn't abuse the feature by sending multiple emails from the site to the same person. The information is discarded monthly and will never be sold or transferred to any other organization.

Price Pulse - In order to verify the authenticity of the information submitted to our Price Pulse tool, and to prevent false information submitted by salesman and promoters, we send an email to shoppers who are kind enough to share their experiences with other hybrid enthusiasts. The information will never be sold or transferred to any other organization.

If for any reason you receive an email from us and you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending e-mail to [info@hybridcars.com](mailto:info@hybridcars.com).

**Web Cookies**  
Cookies are a method of tracking information you enter on a web site using a file on your computer. We do use a cookie to log whether you've visited the site before. No personal information is written to the cookie at all. It is primarily used to save you time by automatically populating forms in our discussion forum, and other locations on the site.

**Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

**Links  
**This site contains links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other site.

**Complaints  
**If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact The DMA's Committee on Ethical Business Practices at [mgoldberger@the-dma.org](mailto:mgoldberger@the-dma.org), state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau, The Federal Trade Commission by phone at 202.FTC-HELP (202.382.4357) or electronically at <http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint.htm>.
