**ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

**This Web site is owned and operated by Hydro One Inc. ("Hydro One"). Use of this Web site signifies your agreement to the Hydro One online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using this Web site. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not choose to receive any of our online products and services that require you to provide your personal information; alternatively, you can[contact us](mailto:webmaster@hydroone.com) to learn about different ways that you can receive such products and services.**

For purposes of our Privacy Policy, personal information means individually identifiable information about a user collected online, including a user's first and last name, home or other physical address, e-mail address or telephone number ("Personal Information").

Hydro One treats your Personal Information as confidential and does not disclose it, or use without your written consent, except where such Personal Information is required to be disclosed:  
(a) for billing, settlement or market operation purposes;  
(b) for law enforcement purposes;  
(c) for the purpose of complying with a legal requirement; or  
(d) for the processing of your past due accounts which have been passed to a debt collection agency.

Hydro One may engage employees, contractors, and other companies or third parties to perform work that involves access to Personal Information. In any case, Hydro One will ensure that such parties are required to keep the information confidential and not to use it in any way other than as is necessary to perform their work for us.

Hydro One may disclose summary information obtained by combining data from many accounts, provided that the information has been sufficiently aggregated such that any personal identifiers cannot reasonably be identified.

At the present time, Hydro One does not store "cookies" on your computer. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser "remember" some specific information.

Our Privacy Policy is effective as of June 27, 2003. Hydro One reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this Web site following the posting of any changes to these terms will mean you accept the changes. In the event that Hydro One changes this policy, Hydro One will post a message on the home page of its Web site (for a period of at least thirty days) that states that the Privacy Policy has been changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy. It would be prudent for you to check the Privacy Policy each time you come to our Web site.
