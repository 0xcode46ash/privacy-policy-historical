# Hyatt Hotels and Resorts: Privacy Policy

  
**Hyatt Hotels and Resorts Internet Personal Privacy Policy**

Hyatt Hotels and Resorts have created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy while visiting our Internet site. 

When you make a reservation on hyatt.com, you will be asked to enter personal information in order to secure your reservation. This information is submitted to our booking partner and our Web Hosting provider. Hyatt Hotels and Resorts and these service providers **WILL NOT** sell or distribute any personal information about you or any other individual traveler. The name, address and phone number you provide may be used for marketing or quality assurance purposes for the benefit of Hyatt. While you will receive an e-mail confirmation whenever you make a reservation on-line, you will not receive any unsolicited e-mail as a result of making a reservation on our site. You can, however, sign-up to receive our bi-monthly e-mail news while visiting our site. 

On hyatt.com, we strive to ensure that our partners utilize the most secure encryption technology to allow you to book your travel reservations without the worry of someone stealing your credit card information during the transaction. We have never had an instance of e-commerce theft, and it is highly unlikely it will happen to you on our Web site. 

To make your reservation planning more convenient, we use what is known as a "cookie", which allows the system to temporarily remember your travel dates and preferences during each visit to the site. Cookies also allow us to track the more frequently visited pages of hyatt.com, which helps us to improve the site for your benefit. Cookies are not programs that will corrupt your computer or damage your files. The cookies used do not reveal your personal identity, nor can they capture personal or private data. Our cookies automatically expire as soon as you leave our site. 

If you do not want to accept cookies while on our site, please consult your Internet browser settings for more information. However, if you decide to not accept cookies while visiting hyatt.com, you may not be able to complete certain transactions. 

The hyatt.com site does contain external links that will take you away from hyatt.com to our travel partners. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. 

Should you have any questions regarding our personal privacy policy, please feel free to e-mail us at [concierge@hyatt.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20001205011900id_/http%3A//www.hyatt.com/contact_hyatt.html).
