Except where permitted or required by law, personal information will only be provided to third parties for the purposes of allowing them to provide goods or services to Husky. If any third party acts in a manner inconsistent with the principles in this Privacy Statement, this will be considered to be a serious issue for which appropriate action may be taken by Husky. 

Personal information may also be transferred to another company in the event of a change of ownership of all or part of Husky through an asset or share sale, or some other form of business combination, merger or joint venture. The transfer of personal information will occur only if the parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of the information is protected. Personal information may also be disclosed by and between Husky affiliates in the course of their business activities. 

_(b) Security, Retention and Access_

Husky endeavours to maintain adequate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its operations so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal information. 

Personal information will be retained by Husky for as long as Husky believes it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and as required by applicable laws. Husky has records management protocols that outline the procedures for the retention and destruction of Husky records, including personal information. 

Where permitted or required by law, Husky will allow you to access and review your personal information held by Husky. For further information on how to access your personal information, please contact the Privacy Officers of Husky as set out below. 

_(c) Consent_

Husky has developed this Privacy Statement to inform you of its practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about you and to ensure that Husky has your consent to its personal information practices. If at any time you do not consent to our practices as set out in this Privacy Statement, you may refuse to provide your personal information to Husky. Alternatively, you may withdraw your consent to Husky's collection, use and disclosure practices regarding your personal information, subject to applicable legal, contractual or regulatory restrictions and to reasonable notice to Husky. Unless you contact Husky to refuse or withdraw your consent, Husky assumes that you have consented to Husky's collection, use and disclosure practices as set out in this Privacy Statement. 

If you do refuse or withdraw your consent, this may affect certain aspects of your relationship with Husky, including being eligible for certain payments, benefits, goods or services provided by Husky, to the extent the personal information affected by the refusal or withdrawal of your consent was necessary to process such payments or benefits or provide such goods or services. Further, certain personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Husky as a result of legal, contractual, or regulatory requirements, and your general ability to withdraw or refuse to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by Husky does not imply or confer upon you the right to withdraw or refuse your consent where to do so would interfere with such legal, contractual or regulatory requirements. Finally, where permitted or required by law, Husky may collect, use or disclose personal information without your consent.
