# Husky Energy - Privacy Statement

Husky respects the privacy of personal information about individuals impacted by its operations, including exploration, development, production and retail activities. Husky has prepared this Privacy Statement to inform you of its practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about you and to assure you that Husky is committed to protecting your personal information. Personal information means information about an identifiable individual, and includes information about you such as your name, home address, email address, or telephone number. If you complete an application or order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may be providing personal information.

_(a) Collection, Use and Disclosure Activities of Husky_

When collecting personal information from you, we will explain how we intend to use it, we will collect only what we believe is reasonably necessary to meet those purposes, and we will not use or disclose it for other unrelated purposes without your consent, except in the limited circumstances prescribed by applicable law.

Husky collects personal information about individuals participating in or impacted by its exploration, development, production and retail activities, including information regarding customers, investors, security holders, financial analysts and individuals owning, accessing, using or occupying lands where Husky is, was or may be conducting activities. Information that Husky collects includes, but is not limited to:

  * environment, health and safety information, including information required to contact you and your family and to respond in the event of an emergency;
  * financial information, including banking information, tax information, occupation, payment information, credit or financial history and mortgage information; and
  * regulatory process, license and permit application information, including information required by applicable government and other regulatory agencies or by law.



Husky collects, uses and discloses personal information in order to conduct its business activities, which include, but are not limited to:

  * providing information to shareholders and other interested individuals;
  * providing goods and services;
  * managing customer relationships;
  * acquisitions and divestitures;
  * administering contracts (including leases of mineral and surface rights);
  * conducting exploration, development and production activities including seismic operations, reclamation, drilling and completion and constructing roads, wellsites, pipelines and other facilities;
  * complying with legal and regulatory requirements in the various jurisdictions in which Husky operates; and
  * other reasonable purposes consistent with Husky's business objectives.



Husky uses the services of many third parties in its business, some of which are located outside of Canada. These third party service providers include, but are not limited to:

  * information technology consultants;
  * geophysical contractors;
  * land brokers and land agents;
  * road, well, pipeline and other facilities construction and/or maintenance contractors;
  * environment, health and safety consultants;

  * government authorities; and
  * ethics reporting system management providers.



Except where permitted or required by law, personal information will only be provided to third parties for the purposes of allowing them to provide goods or services to Husky or to permit Husky to carry out its activities. For personal information that is required to be collected with consent, notification shall be given to affected parties before such personal information is collected by, or transferred to, a service provider outside of Canada. Husky currently contracts a third party service provider, EthicsPoint, to provide integrated hotline and web-based ethics reporting systems, software and services. EthicsPoint may collect, transfer and store Personal Information in the United Kingdom, in accordance with the Husky Privacy Policy and under the instruction of Husky. For specific inquiries regarding the collection, use, disclosure or storage of personal information by service providers outside of Canada, please contact the Privacy Officers as set out below.

If any third party acts in a manner inconsistent with the principles in this Privacy Statement, this will be considered to be a serious issue for which appropriate action may be taken by Husky.

Personal information may also be transferred to another company, including a Husky affiliate, in the event of a major business transaction, including a change of ownership of all or part of Husky through an asset or share sale, or some other form of business combination, merger or joint venture. In such circumstances, Husky will follow the special rules regarding business transactions provided for in the applicable privacy legislation. Personal information may also be transferred or disclosed by and between Husky affiliates in the course of their business activities. 

_(b) Security, Retention and Access_

Husky endeavours to maintain adequate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its operations so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal information.

Personal information will be retained by Husky for the period of time necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and as required by applicable laws. Husky has records management protocols that outline the procedures for the retention and destruction of Husky records, including personal information.

Husky will permit you to access and review your personal information held by Husky unless the release of the information may be withheld as permitted or required by law. For further information on how to access your personal information, please contact the Privacy Officers as set out below. 

_(c) Consent_

Husky has developed this Privacy Statement to inform you of its practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. If you do not consent to our practices as set out in this Privacy Statement, you may refuse to provide your personal information to Husky. At any time you may withdraw your consent to Husky's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, subject to applicable legal, contractual or regulatory restrictions and upon providing reasonable notice in writing to Husky. Unless you refuse consent or contact Husky to withdraw your consent, Husky assumes that you have consented to Husky's collection, use and disclosure practices as set out in this Privacy Statement.

If you do refuse or withdraw your consent, please be aware that this may affect certain aspects of your relationship with Husky, including being eligible for certain payments, benefits, goods or services provided by Husky, to the extent the personal information affected by the refusal or withdrawal of your consent was necessary to process such payments or benefits or provide such goods or services. Further, certain personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Husky as a result of legal, contractual, or regulatory requirements, and your general ability to withdraw or refuse to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by Husky does not imply or confer upon you the right to withdraw or refuse your consent where to do so would interfere with such legal, contractual or regulatory requirements. Finally, where permitted or required by law, Husky may collect, use or disclose personal information without your consent.
