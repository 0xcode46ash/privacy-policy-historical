# Privacy Policy - Hushmail – Free Email with Privacy

By visiting our website and using our services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in this privacy policy.

## Your data

We take steps where possible to limit the personal data we collect. The following are the ways in which we may collect personal data:

  1. **Visiting our website.** We keep records of the activity that takes place on our website, including a record of Internet Protocol Addresses (IP addresses) used by website visitors and account holders. We use this information to analyze market trends, gather broad demographic information, and to prevent abuse of our services.
  2. **Creating an account.** When you create an account, we do not require you to provide any personal data. As part of the account creation process, your IP address will be recorded. We use this information to analyze market trends, gather broad demographic information, and to prevent abuse of our services.
  3. **Making a purchase.** When you make a purchase through the Hush website, you will provide us with data that we use to process your payment such as your name, the account you are upgrading, the domain you wish to use for your email, alternate email address, your billing address and your credit card information. Additionally, we will record the IP address from where the payment is made. When we process your payment transaction, this payment information will be transmitted to our payment processor. We use third-party PCI compliant services to process your payment transaction. When we process your payment, we share your IP address, city, country, and postal code with a third – party anti-fraud service to determine the likelihood of the purchase being a fraudulent transaction. We do not store your credit card number on our servers.

When you perform actions such as reading or moving an email, we will also record these actions. We record this information to help resolve customer support queries, maintain services, and for the purpose of preventing abuse. Information we record may include your IP address, your browser type, browser language, date and time of the action, account usernames, sender and recipient email addresses, file names of attachments, subjects of emails, URLs in the bodies of unencrypted email, and any other information that we deem necessary to record for the purposes of maintaining the system and preventing abuse.

  3. We do not store your passphrase on the Hush servers. Instead, a hashed value is stored for authentication. The original passphrase cannot be determined from that hashed value. As a result, we are unable to recover a forgotten passphrase. Please note, we may be required to store a passphrase for an account identified in an order enforceable in British Columbia, Canada. (See the Disclosure of account data section below.)

## Disclosure of account data

Under normal circumstances, we do not and will **never** disclose account data to anyone other than the owner of an account. We will always attempt to authenticate any requests that require the disclosure of account data to ensure they come from the account owner. If we are unable to successfully authenticate a request, we do **not** disclose any account data.

We will only disclose account data in the following circumstances:

  1. If we receive an order enforceable under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, compelling us to disclose account data for a **specific user account**. The account data we disclose may include data in an unencrypted format. Because such orders generally state that we are not permitted to disclose the existence of the order to a user, we will not disclose to any user the existence, or nonexistence, of any order we may have received.
  2. Where there are exigent circumstances, such as where the safety or well-being of an individual or individuals is in imminent danger, and we believe in good faith that the disclosure of account data is reasonably necessary to protect against such harm, we will disclose account data. This may include but is not limited to the welfare of a child, or an act of terrorism.
  3. We comply with Canadian Bill C-22 as enacted into law in Canada. **“An act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child pornography by persons who provide an Internet service”**. This means that should we become aware of a user that is using the Hush service for the transmission or storage of Internet child pornography, we are required to report this to the appropriate authorities and preserve data in the user’s account. As a result of this notification, we may receive an order enforceable in British Columbia, Canada, requiring the disclosure of account data.
