# HushMail.com - Privacy Policy

**Who we are**  
Unless otherwise specified Hush Communications, referred to in this document as "Hush", and its subsidiary companies are the corporate, legal entities that publish Hush.com, HushMail.com, Hush.ai, and pl.HushMail.com.

**How your data is used**  
Hush is committed to protecting the privacy of all its Web site visitors. We do not share, sell, rent, trade or loan personal data to third parties for any purpose, but note that we may collect aggregate statistics for our own marketing research team. Any demographic information collected by Hush is used only to tailor advertising to users while they are connected to the Hush.com service. Hush abides by strict security protocols that limit access to internal information. Hush restricts user information and has protocols that allow only specific employees to have access to the user database itself.

**Web logs and cookies**  
Hush.com does not use cookies but it does log IP addresses to analyze market trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. HushMail.com does not use cookies or log IP addresses but be aware that, when moving from HushMail.com to the Hush.com Website, your information comes under the privacy policy of Hush.com. However, Hush will never log your IP address in such a way that it can be associated with your HushMail email address.

**Accessing your personal data**  
It is not possible for users to view and update their personal information, but this feature will be available in the near future. If, at any time, a user wishes to disable their account and the information therein, they may do so. However, Hush must be able to authenticate the user. We require a securely sent HushMail message including the request for account termination to [postmaster@hushmail.com](mailto:postmaster@hushmail.com) via their HushMail address. 

**Constant improvement**  
This privacy policy is under constant review, and may be modified and updated in the future. However, users will always have the option of having their information permanently removed from the database as described above.

**Non-account related communications**  
Hush does not contact users unless the communication is account related. While a Hush newsletter is generated from time to time to announce new features, HushMail users can opt out either at the time of sign-up or on the receipt of the newsletter. Hush will answer non-account related questions from users, but will not generate mail to users that doesn't directly affect their use of the service.

**Contact us**  
We value your opinions and appreciate your comments. If you have any questions or concerns please contact us by email at [postmaster@hushmail.com](mailto:postmaster@hushmail.com) or by regular mail at:
