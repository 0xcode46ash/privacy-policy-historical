# HushMail

Privacy is our business. We take your privacy seriously. 

**Who we Are**

Hush Communications Corporation (referred to in this document as "Hush") and its subsidiary companies are the corporate, legal entities that publish HushMail. 

**What We Offer**

HushMail offers our users a truly end-to-end secure, fully encrypted, free, Web-based email service. HushMail offers two types of accounts. Our regular account allows users to choose their own address (ex.jdodo@hushmail.com). This account option requires that the user fill out a New Address form. The list of specific questions asked of the user can be viewed in its entirety at: <http://www.hushmail.com/user_info.htm>

The second type of account offered by HushMail is our auto-generated account, which automatically generates an address for the user (ex. auto555@hushmail.com). The user is not required to give any information to HushMail or to fill out a New Address form. 

**How Your Information is Used**

Any demographic information collected by Hush is used only to tailor advertising to users while they are connected to the HushMail service. Aggregate statistical data is used for marketing research purposes. Information regarding specific users is never sold or shared. 

All user information is given voluntarily, and is not required to have or maintain a HushMail address. Hush does not collect credit card or social security number information. User information is only transmitted securely using your browser's SSL encryption (Note: We advise the installation of 128-bit encryption.) Hush abides by strict security protocols that limit access to internal information. Hush restricts user information to employees on a "need-to-know" basis, and has protocols that allow only specific, privileged employees to have access to the user database itself. 

**Web logs and cookies**

HushCom does not log IP addresses or use cookies. 

**Editing Personal Information**

At this point in time, it is not possible for users to view and update their personal information. This feature will be available in the near future. If, at any time, a user wishes to disable their account and the information therein, they may do so. However, Hush must be able to authenticate the user. We require a securely sent HushMail message including the request for account termination to [info@hushmail.com](mailto:info@hushmail.com) via their HushMail address. 

**Constant Improvement**

This privacy policy is under constant review, and may be modified and updated in the future. However, users will always have the option of having their information permanently removed from the database as described above. 

**Non-Account Related Communications**

HushMail does not contact users unless the communication is account related. While a newsletter, from the Company, is generated from time to time that announces new features, HushMail users can opt-out either at the time of sign up or upon the receipt of the newsletter. HushMail will answer non-account related questions from users, but will not generate mail to users that doesn't directly affect their use of the service, however, users can opt-out of any communications with the Company whatsoever if they so choose. 

**Contact Us**
