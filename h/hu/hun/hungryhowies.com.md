# Privacy Statement | Hungry Howies

This policy describes how Hungry Howie's Pizza ("Hungry Howies") may use information collected from users of this site.  Hungry Howies reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and without sending notice to you, so you should review this Privacy Policy periodically.  The effective date of this notice and any revised or changed notice may be found on this page, on the upper left corner of the notice.

**Collection of Personal Information**

We may collect the following information from users who provide us this information in order to create an account and/or order from Hungry Howies or any of its independently owned and operated franchised restaurants or food service providers:  your name, your e-mail address, your phone number, your address, your credit card numbers, and your order history.  If you elect to establish an online account and/or order online, we have contracted with a third party to perform these functions for us, so that third party’s privacy policy and terms of use also apply.

Hungry Howies’ policy is to prohibit the unlawful disclosure of your personal information, but Hungry Howies makes no representation or warranties regarding the security or privacy of information that you may provide through this website.

Hungry Howies has entered into a joint marketing arrangement with our independently owned and operated franchised restaurants and/or food service providers and any information provided by you may be shared with our independently owned franchised restaurants and/or food service providers.  Hungry Howies may contact any individual who has shared personally identifiable information with Hungry Howies for sales and marketing purposes, for feedback about Hungry Howies and its services, or for any other reason logically related to the operation of Hungry Howie's business and agency.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

The preceding paragraphs describe the categories of personally identifiable information that Hungry Howies collects in this site.  Hungry Howies may disclose personally identifiable information you provide to third parties if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:  (a) complete the sales transaction, such as providing your payment or delivery information; (b) comply with legal process; (c) enforce the Terms of Use; (d) respond to claims that any information you provide violates the rights of third parties; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Hungry Howies, its users and/or the public; or (f) in relation to the sale, assignment, transfer or acquisition of all or substantially all of Hungry Howie’s assets or shares by a third party.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Hungry Howies will NOT sell or trade your personally identifiable information with third parties, such as sellers of goods or services.
