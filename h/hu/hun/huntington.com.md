**Your Privacy Rights**

**Huntington’s Online Privacy Policy**

This Online Privacy Policy ("Online Policy") applies to The Huntington National Bank, its parent Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively described as "Huntington," "we," or "us"), this website and any Huntington website that links to this Online Policy (each a "Site, and collectively "Sites"). This Online Policy specifically applies to Huntington's online collection, use and disclosure of information collected from visitors during use of the Sites, such as for transactional purposes or through online tracking technology, including cookies or action tags. This Site is operated in and controlled from the United States of America. This Online Policy should be read together with the "What Does Huntington Do with Your Personal Information" Privacy Notice ("Privacy Notice") below, which, among other things, describes how Huntington may share personal information gathered from you and how you can opt-out or limit certain types of information sharing. 

**Effective Date**   
The Online Policy is effective as of 5/11/2011.

**Changes to the Online Policy**   
We reserve the right to amend the Online Policy at any time to address future developments of Huntington, the Site or changes in industry or legal trends. We will post the revised Online Policy on the Site or announce the change on the Site's homepage. If we make changes to the Online Policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" section above. Any changes to this Online Policy will become effective upon the posting of the revised Online Policy on the Site. By continuing to use the Site following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of this Online Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or in part, please do not continue using this Site. If you have any questions or comments about the Online Policy, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@huntington.com](mailto:privacy@huntington.com).

**Types of Information Collected**   
We collect Personal Information and Aggregate Information from visitors to the Site. We use the term "Personal Information" to mean any information that can identify a specific individual. We use the term "Aggregate Information" to refer to any information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual, such as demographic information, areas visited on the Site or what browser was used to access the Site.

**Personal Information**   
We collect various types of Personal Information from visitors to the Site, such as name, address, email address, phone number, mother's maiden name, Social Security number, date of birth, driver's license, employment, income, residence, and collateral information.

**Aggregate Information**   
As described in the next section, we may gather and store Aggregate Information about Site visitors. The collection of this Aggregate Information enables us to measure the number of visitors to various portions of the Site, diagnose problems with our Site, administer the Site, and track visitor activity. We will use Aggregate Information to learn more about what you and our customers are expecting from our services to improve the Site. Because Aggregate Information collected on the Site does not personally identify you, we may use Aggregate Information for any purpose whatsoever and share Aggregate Information with third parties for any purpose whatsoever.

**Notice** **Regarding the Use of Cookies or Similar Technologies**   
Cookies or other similar technologies may be used to gather information. Cookies are electronic files that your internet browser places on your hard drive to retain information relating to visits to and use of a website. We use cookies to improve the functionality of our Site. We do not use cookies to store or transmit Personal Information. We use cookies to enable our customers to navigate more easily within our Site during an online session. We use "persistent" cookies to allow you to set and maintain your preferences for using our Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer's memory after you close your internet browser.

We also use 1x1 pixel "action tags," which are types of tracking technology associated with cookies. Action tags help us know how many visitors link to our Site from a third-party website, which areas of our Site visitors use most often, and how much time visitors spend at our Site. We provide this type of Aggregate Information to a nonaffiliated application service provider that compiles statistical information for us. Collection of this data enhances Huntington's ability to meet the needs of online users and make improvements to the online experience.

We engage third party advertising companies to serve ads on Huntington's behalf across the internet. Huntington is not providing, and these companies do not collect, your Personal Information. These companies may use behavioral information obtained from action tags, such as how you navigate websites, to provide Huntington advertisements to you. In addition, we may engage these companies to track and report performance of advertising and marketing campaigns to and from Huntington. These companies may not use your behavioral information for any purpose other than to deliver Huntington ads on the internet.

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your internet browser or through the use of software programs specifically designed to block cookies. Please note, however, that if you choose to block cookies, you will not be able to log into our secure Online Banking service, and you may limit other functionality we can provide when you visit our Site. You can also remove cookies by deleting them from your Temporary Internet or Cookies folder.

**Our Use of Personal Information**   
Consistent with our Privacy Notice, we use Personal Information provided by Site visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided, such as to open an account for you, to process a transaction authorized by you, to send you information we think may be of interest to you, to evaluate your suitability for a job if you apply on line through the Careers section of our Site, or as specifically disclosed at the time the information is requested.

We also may remove identifiers from Personal Information or aggregate that information to make it anonymous. We will use such Aggregate Information as described in the section "Aggregate Information."

**Disclosure of Personal Information**   
We may disclose Personal Information, as permitted by law, and: (1) consistent with our Privacy Notice; (2) to comply with applicable laws; (3) to respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (4) to comply with valid legal process; (5) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Huntington; (6) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit damages that we may sustain and (7) to enforce our rights resulting from inappropriate use of the Site.

In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of Huntington such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, or transfer of substantial assets, Huntington may, in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Site, including without limitation, Personal Information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.

**Your Choice About Receiving Promotional E-mails**   
Visitors may choose not to receive promotional e-mails or electronic newsletters from us by following the instructions in the specific email from which they wish to opt-out. We will respond to a request made pursuant to this method as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to tell you important information about the Site or us, or in response to a transactional or service related matter.

**Maintaining Accuracy in Online Information**   
We strive to maintain complete and accurate online information about you and your accounts. If you believe that our online records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please call us toll-free at 1-800-480-BANK (2265) (24 hours a day, seven days a week). Our Online Banking customers may access and edit their own information by logging in to our secure Online Banking service and clicking on the "Customer Service" tab. We will correct any confirmed inaccuracies as necessary and appropriate.

**Notice Regarding Children's Information**   
We respect the privacy of children and comply with the practices established under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information from children.

**Safeguarding Personal Information**   
We employ appropriate safeguards to protect Personal Information that you provide to us through our Site. Unfortunately, no method of transmitting or storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us of the problem by contacting us at [privacy@huntington.com](mailto:privacy@huntington.com)

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.

We may include links in our emails that link you to information on our Web site about our products, services, and special pricing or promotional offers. However, we will never ask you for Personal Information in an email from us (for example, username, password, Social Security number or account number). We will also never include links that take you to a non-secure page where you are asked to provide this information. To determine whether an email that you have received from Huntington is legitimate, you may contact our Customer Service Center toll-free at 1-800-480-BANK (2265) (24 hours a day, seven days a week).

If you receive an email or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information via email or to a Web site that does not seem to be affiliated with the Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information and report such request to us at [idtheft@huntington.com](mailto:idtheft@huntington.com).

**Notice Regarding Web Linking Practices**   
We may provide access to information, products or services offered on websites that are owned or operated by other companies ("Third Party Websites"). We provide this access through the use of hyperlinks that automatically move you from a Huntington website to the Third Party Website.

While we do our best to provide you with helpful, trustworthy resources, we cannot endorse, approve or guarantee information, products, services or recommendations provided at any Third Party Website. Because we may not always know when information on a linked site changes, Huntington is not responsible for the content or accuracy of any Third Party Website. Huntington shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort resulting from the use of a link on its websites nor will it be liable for any failure of products or services advertised or provided on any Third Party Website.

Huntington offers links to you on an "as is" basis. When you visit a Third Party Website by using a link on a Huntington site, you will no longer be protected by Huntington's privacy policy or security practices. The data collection, use, and protection practices of the Third Party Website may differ from the practices of Huntington sites. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and security practices of Third Party Websites that you choose to visit. Those are the policies and practices that will apply to your use of the Third Party Website, NOT Huntington's policies and practices.

Products, services, and benefits offered by third parties at Third Party Websites are obligations of those third parties, are not an obligation of, a deposit of, or guaranteed by Huntington or any of its affiliates, and are not FDIC insured.

**Notice Regarding the Use of Online Surveys and Sweepstakes**   
Online surveys and sweepstakes are offered from time to time on the Site. Online surveys are used so that we can gather information to better serve you. Based on the information you provide to us, we may inform you of accounts and services from Huntington. You are not required to complete online surveys, sweepstakes or promotions. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes or promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about Huntington's use of Personal Information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of each sweepstakes or promotion concerning treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Online Policy, the terms and conditions will control.

**Notice Regarding the Use of Online Planning Tools**   
We make planning tools, such as mortgage and savings calculators available. We do not currently store information that you enter into one of these planning tools or calculators.
