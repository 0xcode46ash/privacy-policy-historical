** You will notice the term “cookies” used throughout the Internet to describe small text files used by our Web server to communicate with your Internet browser. We use cookies to improve the functionality of our Web site. We do not use cookies to store or transmit any personal, identifiable information about you.

We use temporary “session” cookies to enable our customers to navigate more easily within our Web site during an online session. These cookies are deleted once you close your Internet browser. We may also use “persistent” cookies to allow you to set and maintain your preferences for using our Web site. Persistent cookies remain in your computer’s memory after you close your Internet browser. These cookies help us to know how many visitors link to our site from a third party Web site, which areas of our site visitors use most often, and how much time visitors spend at our site. We provide this anonymous and aggregated data to a nonaffiliated application service provider who compiles statistical information for us. We then use this information to improve our Web site.

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your Internet browser or through the use of software programs specifically designed to block cookies. Please note, however, that if you choose to block cookies, you will not be able to utilize our secure Online Banking area, and you may limit other functionality we can provide when you visit our site. You can also remove cookies by deleting them from your Temporary Internet folder or your Cookies folder.

**Safeguarding Personal Information**   
We employ appropriate safeguards to protect any personal information that you provide to us through our Web site from unauthorized third party access.

**Notice Regarding Web Linking Practices**   
We provide access to information, services, and products through Web sites that are owned or operated by other companies (“third party Web sites”). We have carefully chosen a number of other companies to provide information, services, and products, in hopes of bringing you the value and service you expect from Huntington. You can identify that you are at a third party's Web site instead of ours when you have used a hyperlink which takes you to a new location, and the Web site address of the linked site appears in the “netsite” or "address" box at the top of your browser, or when a new browser window is opened, in which the new third party Web site appears.

We have done our best to provide you with information, services, and products from trustworthy third party companies; however, we cannot endorse, approve or guarantee information, products, services or recommendations provided at any third party's Web site. Because we may not always know when information on a third party site changes, we are not responsible for the content or accuracy of any third party Web site. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort resulting from the use of a third party web link, nor will it be liable for any failure of products or services advertised or provided on these third parties' sites.

When you visit a third party Web site by using a hyperlink from a Huntington site, our Privacy Notice and [ security practices ](http://www.huntington.com/footer/HNB3700.htm) will no longer protect you. The data collection, use, and protection provided by the linked site may differ from those at Huntington. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and security practices of any third party linked site you visit. Those are the policies and practices that will apply to your use of the third party linked site, NOT Huntington's policies and practices. Because the privacy and information security practices may be different than Huntington's, you may be at greater risk to computer viruses, malicious code, or other defects in Web sites that may affect your computer.

We have also established co-branded relationships with other parties on the Internet to offer you information, services, and products. You can identify that you are at a co-branded Web site through the use of a hyperlink, when you see the words "brought to you by", "powered by", or "provided by", or the logo of a different company is visible in a prominent location on the web page. We do not own the companies that we have chosen to develop a co-branded relationship with, and we do not control how those companies use any information you supply them.

**Notice Regarding the Use of Online Surveys**   
Online surveys and sweepstakes are offered from time to time on our Web site. Online surveys are used so that we can gather information to better serve you. Based on the information you provide to us, we may inform you of accounts and services from Huntington. As always, if you have asked us not to contact you with marketing offers, your request will be honored in accordance with the above Privacy Notice. ** ** You are not required to complete online surveys, sweepstakes or promotions.

**Notice Regarding the Use of Online Planning Tools**   
We make planning tools, such as mortgage and savings calculators available. Information that you enter into one of these planning tools or calculators may be stored for your future access and use. We will let you know when we plan to store information, and we will give you the option not to have this information saved.
