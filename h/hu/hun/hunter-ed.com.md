# Privacy Policy - Today's Hunter Rider, Official Site for Hunter Safety Education

**Hunter Ed** is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. Because **Hunter Ed** gathers information about the users that choose to take the online state certification exams, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. Please review the following policy to understand how the information you provide **Hunter Ed** will be treated.

## Information We Collect

First, we only collect specific information on those users who choose to take the online certification exam.

You are free to visit the hunter safety course pages, take the Chapter Review quizzes and take the Practice Test without identifying yourself. However if you opt to take the Certification Exam, we will request certain personal information, including your name, birthday, gender, city and state, e-mail address and, if required by the state, Social Security Number. This information is required by the state agencies responsible for hunter safety to issue your hunter safety certification card. In addition, you will be required to pay for the Certification Exam by supplying a valid credit card number, expiration date and name.

## What Hunter Ed Does with the Information We Collect

The personal information you supply to **Hunter Ed** will not be disclosed outside of **Hunter Ed** , except to securely transfer the personal data to the agency in your state which is responsible for hunter safety in order to issue your hunter education certificate. Your credit card information will be used only for processing your fee(s) related to taking the online certification exam.

**Hunter Ed** will not use the personal information we collect for any other purpose other than to help you obtain your hunter safety certification.

## With Whom Information Is Shared

We do not share, sell or otherwise distribute information about individual users taking the online hunter safety exam with any third party, or any outside companies or organizations except the agency in your state which is responsible for hunter safety.
