**What We Collect**  
Human Kinetics Inc., and its related companies and subsidiaries (collectively HK), recognize the importance of protecting the information gathered from users in the operation of this website and takes reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity and privacy of any information collected. Although HK employs reasonable measures in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of information through the website, you should be aware that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from HK through this website or by email cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, HK is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the internet. By submitting your information to HK you consent to the practices described herein.

HK collects information about individuals as provided on a voluntary basis such as during the ordering process, website registration, on-line courses, certification tests, conference attendance, catalog requests, surveys or e-mails subscription requests.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number) on bulletin boards, blogs or in chat areas of the HK site, or sites of any related companies or subsidiaries, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user’s communication, can be collected and used by third parties who are not affiliated with Human Kinetics. Although Human Kinetics takes every precaution possible to protect your information, by choosing to post personal information in areas that are viewable to all site visitors, such as forums and blogs, you are doing so at your own risk. Posting personal information may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are not facilitated by Human Kinetics and are beyond our control.

**Cookies**  
Users should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Human Kinetics’ internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user’s system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features available on HumanKinetics.com.

**How We Use Your Information**  
HK reserves the right to contact a user regarding product orders, support issues and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or the information collected.

Contact information such as name, address and e-mail may be shared with related companies and subsidiaries of HK, and may be used to send promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from HK and/or its related companies and subsidiaries. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are included in every promotional email. HK does not rent, sell, exchange, or share email addresses with third parties. Postal address information will not be shared with third parties without your permission, or where expressly forbidden by local privacy acts or legislation. When Human Kinetics shares your postal address information with a third party, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. For more details on the sharing of postal addresses in each specific region, please see **Regional Privacy** below.

HK reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site; this analysis will sometimes be used to inform advertisers of site performance. HK will provide only anonymous, aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.

Information or files e-mailed to software technical support or sent through the technical support request system integrated into the HK site will not be used for internal marketing and sales purposes, or be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties.

We may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions; to protect the rights, property, and safety of Human Kinetics ecommerce site, our users, or others; or to conform to the requirements of law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on us. If customers do not pay us for products ordered, we may submit their account information to a third-party collection agency.

**Opt Out Details**  
Upon request, HK will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Human Kinetics will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user’s request, HK will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user’s entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions. Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contactus) with any opt out requests.

When information is collected, the user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt in" to receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from HK and/or any third parties.
