# Privacy Policy | Humanities Tennessee

We are committed to preserving your privacy and safeguarding your email address and use of our site. The following statement describes what information is collected from visitors to our website and how that information is used.

**Secure online donations:**  
There are some instances in which you may be asked to provide personal information to Humanities Tennessee, such as when you make a donation online. In these cases, HumanitiesTennessee.org uses encryption software to help us keep this personal information, including credit card numbers, secure. The information provided over our secure servers is used to process your request; we do not store any credit card information on our servers. Your contact information will be added to our donor database, and you will receive Humanities Matters, our eNewsletter, to keep you informed of our work. For more information about Humanities Matters — including the simple "unsubscribe" procedure — read below.

**Collecting personal information:**  
When you supply email addresses or any other contact information to us in the process of subscribing to discussion lists or other forms of electronic communication, such as our newsletter, we keep that information safe and will not share it with any other organization or individual for any purpose. We collect such information only to provide you with communication directly from Humanities Tennessee.

**Our free bi-monthly eNewsletter:**  
HumanitiesTennessee.org offers its own free bi-monthly eNewsletter, Humanities Matters, that we send out to interested individuals. If you wish to receive our eNewsletter, you may do so simply by sending an email message with the subject line "Subscribe to newsletter" to [tim@humanitiestennessee.org](mailto:tim@humanitiestennessee.org). Subscribers may choose to unsubscribe at any time by following the "unsubscribe" information located at the bottom of each eNewsletter.

**Links:**  
HumanitiesTennessee.org contains links to external websites as a resource for those who are interested in getting additional information related to some of the content of our site. We encourage you to view the privacy policies of those sites as well. Any information you share with those websites is subject to their policies and practices and is independent of HumanitiesTennessee.org.

**Cookies:  **     
HumanitiesTennessee.org currently does not set nor read any cookies on any of our pages. Any future change to that policy will be reflected in this statement when it is applicable.

**Web log files:**  
Like most websites, we use log files that record information such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, and page navigations. We use this information to track visitor movement over the entire site, and to gather broad demographic information for its use in order to learn how people are using the site. IP addresses that are recorded by our log files are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Changes to our privacy policy:**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to our homepage, to this privacy statement, and to other places we deem appropriate so visitors are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

This policy is in effect as of September, 2011.
