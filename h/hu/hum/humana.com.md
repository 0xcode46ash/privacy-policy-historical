There are instances in which Humana might use the personal information that you voluntarily submit internally. These instances include identifying and registering you for the secured area of the Humana web sites. In addition, we may disclose your personal information – as described below – to our agents, third-party partners, affiliates, and subsidiaries to enable them to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order or service fulfillment, e-mail campaign provider, and/or credit card processing service. These companies are only permitted to share, store and/or use personally identifiable information for contracted business purposes.

We may also use your security question and response, and birth date in case you forget or misplace your password. By learning a little about you, Humana can deliver more relevant content and product offerings in an effort to provide you with better service.
