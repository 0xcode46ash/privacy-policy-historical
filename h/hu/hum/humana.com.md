If you do elect to provide personal information to us, in no case will we sell, license or transmit that information outside of Humana Inc. for any reason, unless you authorize us to do so.

There are instances in which Humana Inc. might internally use the personal information you voluntarily submit. These instances include identifying and registering you for the Self-Service Center portion of our website. In addition, we may disclose your personal information (as described below) to our agents, third party partners, affiliates and subsidiaries to enable them to perform certain functions for us. We may also use your Secret Prompt, Secret Response and birth date to later identify you in case you forget or misplace your password. By learning a little about you, Humana Inc. can deliver more relevant content and product offerings, hence provide you better service.

Personally Identifiable Information is described as data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, social security number and date of birth (DOB).

Members, physicians, employers, business partners and agents have the ability to register in a secured area of our website in order for us to deliver such products or services. Additional information collected by these websites may include organization names, addresses, group numbers and tax identification numbers. The purpose of the registration is to validate members, providers, employers, business partners and agents requesting access to our secured area. The registration also enables us to tailor the information sent to you. Contact forms are used only to deliver requested materials and respond to your questions.
