  1. This Policy applies to all Humanity® Websites (“Websites”) owned and operated by ShiftPlanning. Our Site includes links to other Websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Humanity®. This Policy does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ Websites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those Websites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

  2. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third parties, and your rights to update or correct it.

  3. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or Websites that Humanity® does not own or control, or to people that Humanity® does not employ or manage.



ShiftPlanning has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe’s program requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/) and [TRUSTed Cloud Requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/TRUSTed-cloud/) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

## Aggregate Data

We gather certain generic information with respect to users of our Website. Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Website that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our users use certain parts of our Website, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing and user friendly as possible. We may also share aggregate data of users’ collective use of our Website with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business (“Affiliates” or “Business Partners”). We do this so they, too, can improve functionality and offer services and materials that users want.

## Cookies

We use “cookies” on our Website. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies tell our computer that you’ve visited before and help to make your visit more personal so you don’t have to re-enter info on a return visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our Website. We do not tie the information gathered to our ‘Customers’ or ‘Users’ personal information.

Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, and to customize your experience while on our Websites. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, tags and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you’ve received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features like checking out (and participation in certain offerings) on our Website if you choose not to accept cookies. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Website.

## Analytics / Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

## IP Addresses

We collect and analyze traffic on our Website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We log this information so that we can monitor things like the number of visitors visiting the Website;  however, we do not link your IP address to any personal identifying information.

## Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Personalizing Your Experience on the Website

We try to personalize your experience on our Website by tracking shift requests, shift trade requests, vacation requests, etc. and other content you may have sent or received. From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gauge user interest in new products and premiums we may offer, as well as to try and enhance your experience with the Website, by creating additional services, or optimizing those services that already exist. We will ask for your feedback on many site features. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you may be interested in.

## Information Gathered from Members

If you elect to contact us, setup a free trial or purchase a product on a Humanity™ owned website, you will be required to provide us with certain personal information, including your name, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date, and billing address (this required information is subject to change from time to time). There may also be opportunities for you to provide us with additional information regarding your preferences and interests. This information, however, is not required and is completely optional on your part. Additional data may be collected from you based upon certain services you elect to utilize on our Website. By obtaining this information, we can provide our users with specific content and advertising in which they might be interested. None of this information is required to use our service or to become a user; however, the omission of certain types of data will limit the value of your use of these features. If you become a user of our Website or from one of our affiliated Website, we may share your registration information with the affiliates.

You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing your settings at the device level or by contacting us at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com).

You can also log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

When you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we use an advanced encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties.

Our main servers are operated from a dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24/7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at our websites, you can send an email to [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com).

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Humanity® will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments.

Humanity® expects you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information. You may review our policy anytime as it will always be linked to our website.

## How does the Privacy Policy deal with Children?

Children should always get permission from their parents before sending information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet. We will not knowingly encourage any minor to register with our site or to access those features which require registration. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that any concerned parent or guardian of the child contact us.

## Use Common Sense in All Your Online Activities

Even the best Privacy Policy can’t protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities.

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings.

Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an online bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. You should also be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information.

We also display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com)

## Contact Information

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should email Humanity® Customer Service at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com) or contact us at +1 (866) 973-7866 or 235 Montgomery St 500 San Francisco, CA 94104, USA
