# Privacy Policy - Humanity

This Policy applies to all Humanity® Websites, www.Humanity.com and our mobile application owned and operated by Humanity.com, Inc (Humanity). Our website includes links to other sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Humanity®. This Policy does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third parties, and your rights to update or correct it.

Humanity participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Framework. . Humanity is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s [www.privacyshield.gov/list](http://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

Humanity is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Humanity complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Humanity is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission AND/OR the U.S. Department of Transportation]. In certain situations, I Humanity may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request)

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the [www.privacyshield.gov/welcome](http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Humanity commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Private Shield policy should first contact Humanity at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com).

Humanity has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.

##  Aggregate Data 

We gather certain generic information with respect to users of our Website. Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Website that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our users use certain parts of our Website, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing and user friendly as possible. We may also share aggregate data of users’ collective use of our Website with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business (“Affiliates” or “Business Partners”). We do this so they, too, can improve functionality and offer services and materials that users want.

##  Tracking Technologies 

Humanity and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, LSO storage and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the Website, tracking users’ movements, make it easier to navigate, customize your experience and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole on our Website. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies tell our computer that you’ve visited before and help to make your visit more personal so you don’t have to re-enter info on a return visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our Website. We do not tie the information gathered to our ‘Customers’ or ‘Users’ personal information.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you’ve received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features like checking out (and participation in certain offerings) on our Website if you choose not to accept cookies. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Website.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, tags and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

##  IP Addresses 

We collect and analyze traffic on our Website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We log this information so that we can monitor things like the number of visitors visiting the Website; however, we do not link your IP address to any personal identifying information.

##  Social Media Widgets 

Our Web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

##  Personalizing Your Experience on the Website 

We try to personalize your experience on our Website by tracking shift requests, shift trade requests, vacation requests, etc. and other content you may have sent or received. From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gauge user interest in new products and premiums we may offer, as well as to try and enhance your experience with the Website, by creating additional services, or optimizing those services that already exist. We will ask for your feedback on many site features.

##  Information Gathered from Members 

If you elect to contact us, setup a free trial or purchase a product on a Humanity™ owned website, you will be required to provide us with certain personal information, including your name, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date, and billing address (this required information is subject to change from time to time). There may also be opportunities for you to provide us with additional information regarding your preferences and interests. This information, however, is not required and is completely optional on your part. Additional data may be collected from you based upon certain services you elect to utilize on our Website. By obtaining this information, we can provide our users with specific content and advertising in which they might be interested. None of this information is required to use our service or to become a user; however, the omission of certain types of data will limit the value of your use of these features. If you become a user of our Website or from one of our affiliated Website, we may share your registration information with the affiliates.

When you download and use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”).

You can also log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

##  Uses of Personal Information 

If you have provided us your consent via opt-in subscription, we may use the information we have collected about you in five ways: 

  1. To support any of your requests like order processing;
  2. To contact the user for feedback and surveys;

## Information Disclosure

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, you may contact us at: [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com)

We may also provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering you customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Notwithstanding the above policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law, requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or we believe that such action is necessary:

  1. To comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order;

  3. To investigate reports of users sending material using a false e-mail address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;
  4. To protect Humanity® against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website and/or the Humanity® service; or
  5. During emergencies, such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.
  6. To any third party with your prior consent to.



## Sale of Assets

In the event that Humanity® and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right to transfer our user databases together with any personal information contained therein, to a third party acquiring Humanity® assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

## Data Security

When you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we use an advanced encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, a lock or key icon appears on the bottom of your web browser. In addition to our online security efforts, we take reasonable steps to protect your personal data offline, as well. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Our main servers are operated from a dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion sensors, and 24/7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and security breach alarms. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at our Websites, you can send an email to [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com).

We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. 

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Humanity® will occasionally update this privacy policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments. When Humanity® posts changes to this policy, you will see a date depicting the last update of the policy on the top of this page. If there are material changes to this policy in how Humanity® uses your personal information, Humanity® will prominently post a notice on the homepage of our Websites prior to implementing the change. Humanity® expects you to periodically review this policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information. You may review our policy anytime as it will always be linked to our Websites.

## How does the Privacy Policy deal with Children?

We do not knowingly encourage any minor to register with our site or to access those features which require registration. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that any concerned parent or guardian of the child contact us.

## Use Common Sense in All Your Online Activities

Even the best privacy policy can’t protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities.

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings.

Upon request Humanity will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an online bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. You should also be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information.

We also display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com)

##  Contact Information 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should email Humanity® Customer Service at [info@humanity.com](mailto:info@humanity.com) or contact us at +1 (866) 973-7866 or 50 Osgood Place Suite 330 San Francisco, CA 94133
