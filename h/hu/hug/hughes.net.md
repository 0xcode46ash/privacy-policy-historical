**Disclosure**  
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to HUGHES/DIRECWAY or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. But as we mention above, we may share with our Website partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of HUGHES/DIRECWAY.

Finally, please note that this policy applies only to HUGHES/DIRECWAY brand, and not to other companies or organizations' Websites to which we link. We have clearly marked HUGHES/DIRECWAY and these branded Websites with our logo so you know where this policy applies.

**Information About All HUGHES/DIRECWAY Visitors**  
In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to HUGHES/DIRECWAY and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, HUGHES/DIRECWAY uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. HUGHES/DIRECWAY cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our HUGHES/DIRECWAY partners about how our subscribers, collectively, use HUGHES/DIRECWAY. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well.

**Information About You**  
Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use the service. We will need certain information - such as name, Internet address or username, billing address, type of computer, credit card numberâ€”in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not.

**HUGHES/DIRECWAY Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy for HUGHES/DIRECWAY, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
