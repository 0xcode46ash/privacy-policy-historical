# HUGGIES Privacy Policy

This website is owned and operated by Kimberly-Clark Corporation. Here at Kimberly-Clark, we recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the information they provide to us and how we treat that information. So we've developed a Privacy Policy to address those concerns. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally. 

**Our Policy**

At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means you do not have to sign up in order to look at our site. However, if you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or ask to be put on our mailing list, we may contact you from time to time. 

There are some features of our site that require you to sign up to use. And, if you do sign up, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the information or services you've requested. This may include our giving your name, e-mail and postal addresses to a fulfillment house or distributor of our products in which you have expressed interest. See the section below entitled If You Want to Buy Products for more details. 

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). 

**Kids**

If you are twelve (12) years old or under, before providing your name, address, or e-mail address to us, be sure to ask your parents if it's OK. 

**If You Want to Buy Products**

Some of our sites, such as, Adult Care (www.depend.com), Infant Care (www.huggies.com), Away From Home (www.k-caway.com) and Professional Health Care (www.kchealthcare.com), offer products that are sold through distributors rather than retail stores. If you write, phone or e-mail us that you are interested in products, such as, straps for DEPEND® undergarments, HUGGIES® diapers in preemie size, FLUIDSHIELD® disposable face masks or KAYDRY® EX-L wipers, we will ask you if we may pass your name and postal and e-mail addresses to a distributor of these products who can help you to get product information or products, or both. If you agree, we will pass on your name. 

**Cookies**

Like many companies, we sometimes use "cookie" technology on our web site. These cookies are stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want.
