### Privacy Policy

Hurley is committed to respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. The following U.S. online privacy policy, updated in February 2007, describes the information we collect and how we use it. By using this website, you consent to our privacy policy. For questions or concerns, please email us or contact us at:

Hurley

Collecting Information

Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For more information, see "Cookies and Pixel Tags" section below.

We request information from you (which may include name, address, telephone number, email address, gender and when necessary, credit card information) when you:

  * Register
  * Purchase
  * Request a catalog
  * Request to receive communications
  * Participate in a promotion or other website feature



In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information you give us online with other information from Hurley sources, transactions and communications. This may include data from Hurley stores, direct mail, events, or online marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. This data may include postal address updates and demographic data. We collect information about gift recipients to fulfill the gift purchase, respond to customer service inquiries and for analysis purposes only. All data combined and stored with online data is protected by this privacy policy.

Using Information

We may use the information we collect to:

  * Customize and/or personalize your communications and shopping experience
  * Better respond to your customer service inquiries
  * Communicate with you about your purchase, account information, or customer service needs
  * Communicate with you about our products and events, and for other promotional purposes
  * Improve our business
  * Administer contests, promotions, surveys or other website features



If you have purchased a product from Hurley and have not previously registered on the website as of April 19th, 2004, we will automatically add you to our direct mail (including catalog) list.

Sharing Information

For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between Hurley and our preferred service providers who use that information only to conduct Hurley business. For example, they may handle Hurley's credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share your information to administer a website feature (e.g., music download or race registration) and in that case will notify you before you give us your information. We provide our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information.

From time to time we might establish a business relationship with carefully selected persons or companies whom we believe trustworthy. These are known as our Select Partners. In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personally identifiable information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please click here.

We may provide your information to HURLEY Inc. wholly-owned companies and affiliates, which may be outside the U.S. We may provide information to other companies for purposes such as reporting and marketing. On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

Protecting Your Information

We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Cookies and Pixel Tags

We also use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to help us analyze your online behavior. Pixel tags also allow us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us.

We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.
