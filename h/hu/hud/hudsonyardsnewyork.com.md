# Privacy Policy | Hudson Yards

**Related Privacy Policy**

The Related Companies, L.P., its divisions, affiliates, and subsidiaries (“Related”) have created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to consumer privacy. Related recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal and financial information you may provide Related through this web site or through other means. When you access our web sites or mobile applications, opt to fill out an information submission form, or otherwise provide Related with your personal information, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, you give Related your consent to process and use such submitted information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. The following describes the general information-gathering and dissemination practices for our websites and mobile applications, including those associated with specific Related properties, as well as those of our affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions (the “Related Web sites”).

**Collection of Personal Information**

Related collects personal information when you fill out an online form that is submitted to Related via a Related Web site, including, but not limited to, those forms requesting information about Related or any of our properties, online lease applications, or requests for someone at Related to contact you. The submission forms require you to provide contact information (such as name and e-mail address), and in some cases ask for other optional information (such as your phone number, home address and contact preferences). Lease application forms also request information about your past and present housing, employment and financial information and information about references.

Some Site features are available only to registered users, such as our Resident Circle and bulletin boards. When you register we collect your name and contact information as well as other optional information such as payment card or account information if you choose to provide it. Registration requires that you choose a user name and password to be used to access these features. Tenants may use such features to access information about their unit and their lease and to post messages visible to other registered users.

We may collect location information from users who have authorized us to do so. We may also obtain information about registered users’ use of the Related Web sites and information from third parties such as consumer reporting agencies and data aggregators. 

**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

Related uses the information you provide us for our general commercial purposes, such as to send you information about our company, our properties or our affiliates, as well as to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future promotional mailings or e-mails in accordance with the “Opt-Out” section below. We may use information about you to better understand our tenants, to display content relevant to your interests or preferences and to facilitate your transactions with us. We may use aggregated information that is not personally identifiable to improve our site, our marketing outreach and our rental communities. We may use your location information to provide information that is relevant to your location, such as promotional offers from our partners or information about our properties.

Related may share your personal information if we have your consent or authorization to do so. You agree that we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries that may use it for their own commercial purposes including analytics, marketing, or otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, Related may share your personal information only under the following circumstances:

  * Agents. Related employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., processing transactions that you have requested, creating and maintaining the Related Web sites, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service) (“Agents”). Our Agents will have access to personally identifiable information solely to perform their functions and provide their services to Related, and for no other purpose. 
  * Business Transfers. As Related continues to develop our business, Related may sell or buy assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Thus, if Related or a subsidiary Related controls, sells substantially all of its assets, or is acquired by another entity, customer information may be one of the transferred assets and you agree that you consent to such transfer. 
  * Protection of Related and Others. Related releases account and other personal information when such release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other agreements; protect the rights, property, or safety of Related and our users; or in connection with a legal claim or proceeding. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations as part of our efforts to prevent fraud and identity theft. 



**Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information**

“Non-Personal Information” contains nothing that could identify you personally. Related may collect such Non-Personal Information, such as device type and identification, demographic and profile data, through the Related Web sites. Related may aggregate Non-Personal Information and share it with our affiliated companies and other third parties.

**Security**

Related uses physical, logical, and procedural security measures to protect the information you provide to Related, but information you provide us by email is not secured. However, while Related uses commercially reasonable steps to protect the personal information you provide to Related from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, you accept that no Internet data transmission can be guaranteed to be secure from access by unintended recipients. You also play a role in protecting your information. Please safeguard any user name and password you submit and do not share them with others. Any action taken while securely logged into your account will be considered authorized by you.

**Accuracy and Retention**

You are entitled to request access to and correction of all personal data you provide to Related, or to remove your name from Related’s contact list at any time by contacting us. If you choose to pay your rent or other expenses via a Related Web site, you will be required to provide Related with your credit card or other form of payment and billing information as part of the transaction.

**Opt-Out**

In order to opt-out of future promotional e-mails on a given topic, you should click on the UNSUBSCRIBE link that is available at the bottom of each message. This will halt future promotional communications for that specific function.

To re-subscribe, you may return to the relevant Web site and resubmit the request form. For Residents, you may modify your e-mail preferences through the Profile section of the Resident Circle website. While you may opt-out of promotional e-mails, we will still be permitted to send you e-mails about our transactions with you.

**IP Address**

Related uses your Internet protocol (IP) address or mobile device identification number (MDID) to help diagnose problems with our server, as well as to administer the Related Web sites.

However, Related does not link this information to users' personal information.

**Cookies**

Web sites also use cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a Web site to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. Related may set and access both session and persistent cookies on your computer.
