# Hubworld Privacy Policy

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Website Administrator by using the following link and clicking [here](http://www.hubworld.com/bumper-exit?dest=http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/). If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact [TRUSTe here](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint).

### What Information Do We Collect?

In order to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible, we may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you do the following activities on The Hub Websites: (1) register with us; (2) participate in sweepstakes, contests, events or promotions; (3) fill out online surveys; (4) share postcards, videos, games or pages with friends; (5) any other online activities and/or (6) as required by law. The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. For some activities, we may also ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide demographic information such as your age, gender and/or birthdate. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. 

If you are under the age of 13, only your parent or guardian can provide any personal information to us for online activities, unless it is under the specified exceptions as otherwise described in this Policy. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this Website, ask your parent or guardian for help. See Note To Parents below for more information.

Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to access certain areas on our Website. However, you do not need to provide personal information to us in order to use our Websites generally.

1\. **Registration**

If you (including if you are under the age of 13) wish to keep a record of your scores for games played by you on our Websites you may be required to register a separate account to retain such records by creating a username and password. We do not collect any personal information in that registration process. We may however request demographic information on an optional basis (e.g., birthdate and gender) at the point of such account registration. 

2\. **Sweepstakes/Promotions/Contests**

To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. If we request only your e-mail address or screen name, please do not use your real name for such promotions. For other promotions, except for children under the age of 13, we may also request your full name, phone number and/or home address in order to contact you to let you know if you won a prize or to send you products or information by regular mail. 

For children under the age of 13, we will not collect the child's personal information from them for a sweepstakes or contest; however we may collect the child's e-mail address to enter the child in the sweepstakes or contest, store such e-mail address for the duration of the sweepstakes/contest, use it only to notify the child on a one-time basis that he/she is a winner and then delete all children's e-mail addresses collected for the promotion immediately thereafter. In some sweepstakes or contests, we may also collect the e-mail address of the child's parent (or guardian) to inform the parent of the child's entry, provide the parent an option to have the child's entry deleted, and/or notify the parent that their child has won (if applicable). 

Your personal information (or personal information for children under the age of 13) collected for our promotions is not shared with any third parties, except with entities who use it solely to provide support for the operations of the sweepstakes/promotion/contest. 

3\. **Sharing Content with Friends**

By allowing you to send postcards, videos, games, pages, or other content to friends, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you or the person you are e-mailing (including if you or the person you are e-mailing is under the age of 13). We will use the personal information supplied (such as your first name (as the sender), your friend's first name (as the recipient) and your friend's e-mail address) only to send the postcards, videos, games, pages or other content as you request. This is a one-time e-mail initiated by the user of the Website and this information is not stored or used by us, other than to execute the e-mail. We collect e-mail addresses to send or share content with a friend only to transmit the requested e-mail and delete such e-mail address immediately thereafter. 

4\. **Online Surveys**

In order to improve the user experience at our Websites, we may employ online surveys for visitors (including visitors who are children under the age of 13) to volunteer anonymous demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they visit our Websites and what we can do to make them better. Unless otherwise indicated at the time of collection and/or as described in this Privacy Policy, information collected through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may have provided us through another means.

### Who is Collecting My Information and How Will it be Used? 

In general, you (including if you are a child under the age of 13) do not need to provide personal information to us in order to use our Websites. The Hub may collect personal information you provide (unless you are under the age of 13 except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy) on The Hub Websites in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. If we do collect any personal information, we may use such information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the services we provide you and can better meet your needs. The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by us and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties only for internal business purposes such as demographic and marketing studies. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer.

### With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information? 

  
From time to time, we may employ and share our customers' personal information (including that of children under the age of 13) with entities that use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of The Hub Websites (e.g., online registration and email services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose or in a way inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

  
Similarly, some of our support provider entities, which may include third party administered Websites, may collect your personal information directly, such as when applying for a job through our Jobs section, emailing questions to Viewer Relations, emailing questions to Customer Service, entering sweepstakes, contests and promotions, or when submitting photos and/or videos for posting. In these instances, even though the pages where you enter your personal information have the look and feel of The Hub Websites, the support provider will be identified by a "Powered by" logo or we will notify users when they are leaving The Hub Websites for a third party administered website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information you submit to these support provider sites or third party administered Websites. These entities have agreed not to use your personal information for any purpose other than that stated when you submit the information, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from you. Your use of these Websites and/or applications, however, is subject to the third parties' privacy policies and we encourage you to read such policies before submitting personal or other information to those Websites.

  
We may disclose personal information (including that of children under the age of13) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.

  
We do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about our users (including children under the age of 13) to third parties for promotional purposes. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, our user information may be transferred to our successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law. Please see our "Questions and Complaints" section below for instructions on how we will notify you of such an event.

### Cookies and Clear GIFs 

We use cookies and clear GIFs to enhance your experience at our Websites. These cookies and clear GIFs let us know how many people are coming to individual sites, how frequently, and how they are using the sites, allowing us to make updates to content and improve navigation as appropriate.

  
Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site, and what content they are most interested in. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things, such as your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), your login information, the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. To save you the time of re-entering your login information every time you come back to our Websites, we may link information contained in a cookie to your email address (including that of registered children under the age of 13). We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that we did not originally send in a cookie.

Clear GIFs, sometimes called "Web bugs," are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and can tell us a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to us and we use this information to accurately count visitors across The Hub Websites and understand how they navigate and use our sites. We do not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.

### Flash LSOs

Third parties with whom we partner use local shared objects (LSOs), also known as Flash cookies, to store display content based upon what you view on our site(s) to personalize your visit and to provide certain features on our site(s).

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click [here](http://www.hubworld.com/bumper-exit?dest=http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

### Log Files

Other information passively collected by us is in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and helps us determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.

### Third Party Ad Servers 

Our Websites use third-party advertising networks and other third-party service providers (collectively, "Third Party Ad Servers") to serve advertisements on the Websites. These Third Party Ad Servers do not have access to our data collection technologies on these Websites except to the extent necessary to provide their services to these Websites, but they may have the ability to collect non-personally identifiable information on these Websites through their own technologies and/or they may otherwise have access to other information about you. Information is not collected or used on these Websites for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising to you based on your Web viewing behaviors.

### Linking to Third Party Sites

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to The Hub Websites, and not to websites operated by other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to any other websites from The Hub Websites, this Privacy Policy no longer applies and The Hub does not control the activities of those websites.

To provide relevant information not found on our Websites and to allow you to interact with other websites on which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites), we may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow login from our Websites to third party websites or third party support providers. In these cases, we will: (i) notify users when they are leaving The Hub Website or otherwise indicate that you will be going to a third party's website or (ii) identify such website with a "Powered by" logo. Your use of these Websites and/or applications is subject to the third parties' privacy policies, and we encourage you to read the third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal or other information or using the applications.

### Opt-out

If you do not want us to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from our e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link included within the e-mail or by sending an e-mail to us by clicking [here](http://www.hubworld.com/bumper-exit?dest=http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/).

Please note that "welcome" and service e-mail communications are not promotional in nature and, therefore, an opt-out is not provided. These are simply to notify the user of a service they recently signed up for or to notify the user of Web site issues. 

### Safeguarding Your Personal Information

We will only collect personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will take appropriate steps to ensure the security and integrity of any information (including that of children under the age of 13) you provide to us. Any information provided to us on The Hub Websites is housed in a secure datacenter and sensitive information is secured using SSL encryption.

### Review, Update and Removal of Personal Information

If we have collected personal information from you (including if you are a child under the age of 13 under a one-time collection as noted in this Policy) on our Websites, you (or your parent/legal guardian) may at any time review, delete inaccuracies, and/or update the personal information we have for you or inform us that you want us to remove your information from our database by clicking [here](http://www.hubworld.com/bumper-exit?dest=http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/). If you choose to send us an e-mail, please be sure to include in your message the name of the site to which you submit your personal information and the e-mail address you submitted so that we can verify your request. If your personal information (or personal information of a child under the age of 13) was collected by a third party administered website or support provider website linked to The Hub Websites (as described in "With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?" and "Linking to Third Party Sites") and you seek to review and/or update such personal information, this Privacy Policy does not apply and you must consult such third party's privacy policy on the matters addressed in this paragraph.

### NOTE TO PARENTS

We have developed our Websites to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the Websites or how the sites operate. That is the purpose of the Privacy Policy. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the sites and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about The Hub Websites will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the sites, as well as protect our users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, please contact us using the Contact Information provided below. For all issues, you may contact us by using the following link by clicking here. Please note that if your child's personal information was collected by a third party administered website or support provider website linked to The Hub Websites (as described in "With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?" and "Linking to Third Party Sites"), this Privacy Policy does not apply and you must consult such third party's privacy policy on the matters addressed in this paragraph, including without limitation the means of collection, use and disclosure of children's personal information and parental access to children's personal information. 

### Children Under the Age of 13 

1\. **Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information**

In general, children under the age of 13 can view our content, videos, pages, and play games on The Hub Websites without us collecting their personal information. With regard to sweepstakes/contests/promotions, if we collect and store personal information about children under the age of 13 ("children" or "child"), it is under the one-time collection exception (as noted in "What Information Do We Collect?") or is voluntarily submitted by the child's parent or guardian. If provided by the parent or guardian, we may collect the child's name, phone number, email and mailing address only when necessary to fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. On The Hub Websites generally, we may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on "Cookies and Clear GIFs" (above). We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.

Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. Please also see our section on "What Information Do We Collect?" with regard to sweepstakes/contests/promotions and children under the age of 13. To read about the steps we take to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on "Safeguarding your Personal Information" (above).

2\. **Hubworld.com and Hubbub.com Contact Information**

Any personal information of a child that is provided by the parent/legal guardian or by the child under a one-time exception (as expressly described in this Policy) to Hubworld.com or Hubbub.com or any of The Hub Websites (excluding information provided to third party administered websites to which we link) is collected by the Website administrator, The Hub.

Please read the section titled "With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?" (above) for our policy on the disclosure of personal information collected from and about children under the age of 13.

4\. **Parental Access to Children's Personal Information**

A parent who has already given us permission to collect and use his or her child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or have deleted the child's personal information; and/or, (2) discontinue further collection or use of the child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact us by using the following link by clicking [here](http://www.hubworld.com/bumper-exit?dest=http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/) and be sure to include your child's name and email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site at which such information was collected.
