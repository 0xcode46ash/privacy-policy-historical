  * **Information we may receive from third parties** : We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may collect information about you from social media sites.  If you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, or by “following,” or “liking,” HSF, or sharing your activities on our site on social media, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to HSF.  This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.  This information may be used to pre-populate your HSF account.  If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the HSF.  You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.  If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.  We may also request and collect information about you from third parties such as teachers, schools, and other referral sources, billing and credit agencies, and other third parties.

  * **Clear gifs/web beacons information** :  When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
  * **Device identifiers** :  When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique device identifiers.  Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.  A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Company.  A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service.  A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.  Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
  * **Use of   information collected through technology: **We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, and clear gifs information to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; and (e) diagnose or fix technology problems.

**DONOR BILL OF RIGHTS**

The Hispanic Scholarship Fund adheres to the Donor Bill of Rights created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Non-Profits.  
Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good.  It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life.  To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, it is declared that all donors have these rights.

2.         To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.

3.         To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements.

4.         To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.

5.         To receive appropriate acknowledgment and recognition.

6.         To be assured that information about their donations is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.

7.         To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.

8.         To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers or employees of the organization or hired solicitors.

9.         To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.

10.       To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful, and forthright answers.
