# Privacy statement

The hse.gov.uk site is managed by the Health and Safety Executive Internet Services. This page explains:

  * how we use information you give to us
  * how we protect your privacy



NB: This policy only applies to those resources within the hse.gov.uk domain.

## The Data Protection Act

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard our data, and strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any third party or government department unless you give us permission to do so.

## Information Charter 

From time to time we need to handle personal information about you so that we can provide services for you. Our Information charter shows how we look after that information

  * [Information Charter](https://web.archive.org/web/20090626003830id_/http%3A//www.hse.gov.uk/info-charter.htm)[1]



## What information do we collect?

We collect two kinds of information from visitors to hse.gov.uk: 

  * feedback (through emails to the our Internet services team)
  * site usage information, from cookies and log files



Correspondents should note that all communications to or from Health and Safety Executive may be automatically logged, monitored and/or recorded for lawful purposes.

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback. You can contact us by emailing [hse.webteam@hse.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:hse.webteam@hse.gsi.gov.uk)[2].

## Comments and questions

If you send an email or letter to the Internet Services Team asking for information, we may need to contact other government departments to find the answer. If your question is technical, we may need to pass it to our technology suppliers or our InfoLine team. We do include your personal information when dealing with your enquiry. When the Internet Services Team have replied to you, they keep a record of your message for 3 months for reference and audit purposes, after which it is deleted.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit some websites, and stored in the cookie directory of your computer. Two cookies are created when you visit HSE's website

Our first cookie stores a random number on your computer to help us count the number of times users return to our site. The second cookie is part of a project to share banner advertising for government campaigns and services across government websites. It stores a random number to ensure that you do not always see the same advert and it enables us to count the number of people viewing a web page or a campaign. This cookie is checked when you visit other government websites involved in the same project.

Both cookies are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session.

The cookies do not contain any personal information about you, and they cannot be used to identify an individual user.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies.

## Log files

Log files allow us to record visitors' use of the site. We analyse log file information from all our visitors and use it to make changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it.

Log files do not contain any personal information and they are not used to identify any individual patterns of use of the site.

## What happens when I link to another site?

hse.gov.uk contains links to other websites, both those of government departments and of other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to our site. When you move to another site, read the privacy statement of any site which collects personal information.

We do not pass on any personal information you have given us to any other site.

If you wish to see our records of any correspondence you have sent to us, or if you have a query or complaint about this privacy policy or about the site, you can contact us by email:

  * [hse.webteam@hse.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:hse.webteam@hse.gsi.gov.uk)[3]



## Changes to this privacy policy

If this privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. 

Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.
