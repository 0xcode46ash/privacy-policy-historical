# HSH Associates: Disclaimers and our Privacy Policy

**HSH.com** , **Homeplans.HSH.com** , **BestRates.com** and **Bankrates.com** (as well as other domains registered by us) are subsidiaries of [HSH Associates, Financial Publishers](http://www.hsh.com/abouthsh.html). We are totally committed to protecting your privacy. This is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while visiting our Web site.

(If you believe that you were spammed by our Bestrates.com site, please [click here](http://www.hsh.com/spamalert.html) to discover how the real spammer fooled you.)

Since HSH was founded in 1979, it has been our policy to never sell personally identifying information about our customers.

  * HSH does not collect personally identifying information, except with your specific knowledge and consent.
  * We _never_ sell or offer contact information about our visitors to others. There's no need to send us an "opt out" message to prevent your name from appearing on a million mailing lists.



In some cases, such as if you e-mail a question or a comment to us, we may _request_ your name, e-mail address or other information so that we can, for example, e-mail you with a personal reply. If you choose to supply this information, we will use it only for the specific purpose for which you supply it. 

In other cases, we may _require_ certain personal information -- such as when you fill out an order form on our site (or submit an order through any other means such as phone, fax or mail). In these cases, you must enter your name, address, and certain other information. The information you provide goes **only** to the designer(s) you select, so that they can fulfill your order. Obviously, we must collect this information so your order can be fulfilled. We maintain the information you provide (other than credit card information) to evidence that you have purchased a product.

We never share any of your personally identifying data with any other party without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes.

Some customers find it irritating that, when they re-order a product from us, we don't have their information on file. They need to give us their name, address, and other information every time they re-order. That's because we delete all computer references to your order 30 days after the product is shipped to you.

We retain a _paper_ record of your order for about six months, in case you need to call us. After that time, the paper record is destroyed as well.

We may _offer_ to send you information or updates from HSH Associates via e-mail or otherwise, such as HSH's [Weekly Market Trends mailing list](http://www.hsh.com/trends.html#form). Obviously, signing up will put you on a specific mailing list. We will _not_ put you on any other mailing lists, from us or anyone else, without your permission.

**About "cookies."** Some Web sites use cookies which contain information such as registration information, or similar data, which is stored on your hard drive and sent back to a site when you revisit it. HSH Associates does not, as a rule, use cookies. The only exception is our Homeplans site, which uses cookies _only while you are visiting that site_ ('session ID' cookies) and which are _not_ placed by, or sent to, any third party. [Click here](http://homeplans.hsh.com/cookies.asp) to read more about our use of these cookies.

**If you are receiving "mortgage-rate" spam,** it's not because of us. If you have visited any other mortgage rate sites, _read their privacy policy carefully._

Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we do analyze our 'hit' logs to see how we're doing. However, we only use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we like to know that a certain percentage of our users appear to be in the market for a certain loan type, based on the pages they view.

Our privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the last update was on July 30, 2003.

If you ever have any concerns or questions about our privacy policy, please [send us e-mail](http://www.hsh.com/bnbform.html). We welcome your feedback. You can also write to us at the following address:
