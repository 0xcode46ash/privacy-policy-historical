# HSH Associates: Disclaimers and our Privacy Policy

[HSH Associates, Financial Publishers](http://www.hsh.com/abouthsh.html) is committed to presenting current information about mortgages, consumer finance, and similar topics. _HSH is also committed to protecting your privacy._ This is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while visiting our Web site.

  * HSH Associates does not collect personally identifying information, except with your specific knowledge and consent.
  * We _never_ sell or offer contact information about our visitors to others. There's no need to send us an "opt out" message to prevent your name from appearing on a million mailing lists.
  * Our site doesn't use "cookies."



Click here to read our [extended privacy Statement](http://www.hsh.com/privacy-ext.html).

In some cases, such as if you e-mail a question or some feedback to us, we may _request_ your name, e-mail address or other information so that we can, for example, e-mail you with a personal reply. If you choose to supply this information, we will use it only for the specific purpose for which you supply it. 

In other cases, we may _require_ certain personal information -- such as when you use the "information request" coupons which lenders have on their home pages in the [_Lender Showcase_](http://www.hsh.com/lshow.html) and other Showcases. In these cases, you must enter your name, address, and certain other information. _The information you provide goes only to the lender(s) you select. We don't sell this info to anyone._

When we ask for personal information via our [secure online order form](https://www.hsh.com/secure_orderform.html) (or through any other means such as phone, fax or mail), we will keep your information private. Obviously, we must collect this information so we can fulfill your order. We maintain the information you provide (other than credit card information) to evidence that you have purchased a product.

We never share any of your personally identifying data with any other party without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes.

In addition, since HSH was founded in 1979, it has been our policy to never sell our customers' _postal_ addresses, either. So if you choose to order our [Homebuyer's Mortgage Kit](http://www.hsh.com/catalog.html "Our consumer catalog") or other product and have it mailed to you, we keep your address confidential, too.

Some customers find it irritating that, when they re-order a _Kit_ or other product from us, we don't have their information on file. They need to give us their name, address, and other information every time they re-order. That's because we delete all computer references to your order 30 days after the product is shipped to you.

We retain a _paper_ record of your order for about six months, in case you need to call us. After that time, the paper record is destroyed as well.

We may _offer_ to send you information or updates from HSH Associates via e-mail or otherwise. Obviously, signing up will put you on a specific mailing list. We will _not_ put you on any other mailing lists, from us or anyone else, without your permission.

You may have read about "cookies". Sent to your computer by some Web sites, cookies contain information such as registration information, or similar data, which is stored on your hard drive and sent back to a site when you revisit it. _HSH Associates does not use cookies_ \-- it's that simple. (Most browsers have an option to warn you when a site wants to place a 'cookie' on your computer. Try it and see.)

Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we do analyze our 'hit' logs to see how we're doing; but we only use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we like to know that a certain percentage of our users appear to be in the market for a certain loan type, based on the pages they view.

Our privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the last update was on April 19, 2000.

If you ever have any concerns or questions about our privacy policy, please [send us e-mail](mailto:info@hsh.com). We welcome your feedback. You can also write to us at the following address:
