# Privacy

  


TrustHSS.com is committed to respecting your privacy. We do not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security – it will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.

**DETAILED EXPLANATION OF PRIVACY POLICY**

The following statement describes how we gather and use information from our visitors. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the TrustHSS.com web site – where you can expect to be notified of the following:

  * what personally identifiable information of yours or a third party is collected from you 
  * who is collecting that information 
  * how the information is used 
  * with whom the information may be shared 
  * site choices regarding collection, use and distribution of your information 
  * security procedures in place to protect the information from loss, misuse or alteration



**About Information We Collect**

TrustHSS.com collects two types of information about our visitors: (1) aggregated (collective) data that tracks visitors as a group, and (2) individual user data that is volunteered.

  * **Collective Data**  
TrustHSS.com gathers aggregated data to monitor visitor activity on the site as a whole. This data does not identify you personally. Collective tracking allows us to monitor traffic on the site to determine which areas of the TrustHSS.com web site are most attractive to visitors. This type of information helps us to make improvements and to add new features and services based on visitor interests. We may disclose this aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners. 
  * **Individual User Data**  
We request individual user data when you voluntarily sign up onsite for personalized services, or when you register for contests, sweepstakes, or other promotional programs. For example, to process your order, we require your name, phone number, email address, and home address. We use this information to process your order, including contacting you to finalize your appointment. Except as explained below, this information will not be disclosed to parties other than TrustHSS.com without prior notification. Financial information is used solely to bill for services rendered, and is not shared.



**How We Collect Information**

Like most other web sites, our servers automatically track certain information about your activity on the TrustHSS.com web site. This information includes the following:  


  * your browser 
  * your IP address 
  * referring URL and the TrustHSS.com URLs you visit



**Cookies**

We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help us establish traffic patterns on the TrustHSS.com web site. One way that cookies are used is to allow you to store your user name and password without having to frequently reenter it during a session. Cookies also help us tailor content, special features, and marketing messages that match your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on the TrustHSS.com web site. You are always free to set your browser to decline our cookies and you can delete cookies on your computer. However if you do so, you may find that some areas of our site may not work properly and you will be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.

We place advertising on our site that originates from the outside advertiser or their agency. At times, the advertiser may assign a cookie if you click on their banner or ad. TrustHSS.com does not control these cookies. Again, cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on TrustHSS.com's servers. You are always free to set your browser to decline cookies on from the TrustHSS.com web site.

**How We Use Information We Collect**

Except as described below, we do not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone outside of TrustHSS.com. However, on certain pages, such as contests, we may collect your volunteered personally identifiable data and we will explicitly tell you that the data you give us will be shared with third parties, such as an advertiser. Such disclosures will override anything to the contrary stated in this policy.

**TrustHSS.com Content Providers, Advertisers, and Partners**

We do not give your personal information to anyone outside of TrustHSS.com except in limited circumstances mentioned above, such as contests, and then only with your consent. However, the TrustHSS.com web site contains links to other sites and those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as the TrustHSS.com web site. For example, when you click on an ad on the TrustHSS.com web site, this can take you away from our site to the advertiser's site. These links include advertisers, content providers, retailers and business partners who may use the TrustHSS.com logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and ask for personal information.

If you have provided personal information to a company or advertiser that is linked to the TrustHSS.com web site and have not been informed by the TrustHSS.com web site as to how such information will be used, or if want to understand the privacy practices of such company or advertiser, you should contact that company or advertiser directly. You can do this by going to their web site's home page and looking for a company profile or contact information area on the site.

**Contests and Other Promotions**

To participate in contests and other promotions offered on the TrustHSS.com web site, you are asked to provide certain personal information on a voluntary basis. The contest rules are prominently posted during the duration of the event, including how data gathered from entrants will be used. All contests are conducted in full accordance with U.S. federal and state laws. 

**Data Security**

TrustHSS.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We operate a secure network protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Only authorized individuals have access to the network.

We utilize SSL encryption when accepting and transmitting credit card information across the Internet. SSL technology has effectively protected millions of customers who make purchases over the Internet. Access to information provided by customers is limited to authorized individuals only.

**Correct/Update/Opt-Out Policy**

Changes and corrections to customer information or opting out of receiving communications from us are available through your account profile. You can update your account profile at any time, which includes an option to receive/not receive information from us.
