# HSBC Canada - Privacy Notice

|  **Strictly Between Us: Protecting Your Privacy**  
**Answering your questions about privacy**

**Your privacy**  
At HSBC, we respect your privacy and are committed to keeping personal information about you strictly between us. For the security of all of our customers, we have adopted our own Privacy Code which lists the principles of privacy we observe throughout the HSBC group of companies in Canada*, and is available at your nearest HSBC office or our website at www.hsbc.ca. 

**Your consent**  
_We will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, except where required or permitted by law._

Subject to some restrictions, you may at any time withhold, withdraw or change your consent. To do this, simply visit your HSBC office or our website and complete a form indicating your privacy choices. In most cases, this will have no effect on our relationship with you, however, in some circumstances, it may limit our ability to provide you with certain products or services. Detailed information on our privacy procedures is also available from the Privacy Administrator found in each HSBC office or from the Office of the Privacy Officer.

**The 10 principles of our Privacy Code**  
HSBC has created a detailed Privacy Code, which lists the following 10 principles to ensure we respect the confidentiality of your personal information. A copy of this code is available at any HSBC office or through our website. 

The 10 principles are: 

  1. HSBC is responsible for all personal information under its control and its Privacy Officer is accountable for HSBC's compliance with the principles described in this Privacy Code. 
  2. The purposes for which personal information is collected will be identified and documented by HSBC at or before the time the information is collected. 
  3. An individual's knowledge and consent (express or implied) are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information by HSBC, except as otherwise required or permitted by law. 
  4. HSBC will limit the amount and type of personal information collected to that which is necessary for its purposes. Personal information will be collected by fair and lawful means. 
  5. HSBC will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted by law. Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. 
  6. HSBC will keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as necessary for its purposes. HSBC will minimize the possibility of inappropriate information being considered in its decision making process. 
  7. HSBC will protect personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. 
  8. HSBC will be open about its policies and procedures regarding management of personal information. HSBC will ensure that individuals are reasonably able to acquire information about HSBC's policies and procedures and will make this information available in a form that is generally understandable. 
  9. Upon request in writing, HSBC will inform an individual of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information and will provide access to that information, except where the law requires or permits HSBC to deny access. 
  10. An individual will be able to direct a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to HSBC's Privacy Officer. 



**Answering your questions about privacy**

_What personal information do you need?_

We need information so we can establish a relationship with you and provide you with ongoing service. For example, when you obtain a product or service from us, we need basic information about you such as your name, address and signature which allow us to confirm your identity. For more complex products or services, we may require more detailed personal information. 

Also, when you are opening an account or applying for certain types of products and services, we may require information regarding your personal finances - such as the name of your employer, or your annual income. 

For income tax reporting purposes, the government requires us to keep a record of your social insurance number if you have an account that earns interest or if you are buying registered investment products. 

_We hold all of your personal information in the strictest confidence_

_How is this information used?_

We use your personal information to provide the financial products and services you request, to meet legal and regulatory requirements, and for internal audit, statistical and record-keeping purposes. With your consent, we will also review and share your personal information to identify and inform you about other HSBC financial products and services which may be of interest to you. 

_Where do you obtain personal information about me?_

Most of the information comes directly from you when you apply for financial products or services. We may also need information from credit bureaus, income sources and personal references you have provided to us. Of course, we obtain consent from you before we contact anyone for information about you and we only request information that has a bearing on your financial situation. 

_To whom is personal information disclosed?_

Generally, we do not disclose your personal information without your consent. More specifically, we ask for your written consent for the disclosure of information to credit reporting agencies or to other credit grantors. 

There are however, some exceptions. For example, we sometimes require services from suppliers and agents, such as cheque printers, market research and computer data-processing companies. Before releasing any personal information to them, we obtain their contractual commitment to keep all such information secure and confidential. Our customer lists are for HSBC use only and we never sell or give lists to other companies. 

Another exception is when HSBC requires subpoenas, search warrants, court or government orders. In such cases, HSBC only releases the information to the extent it is legally required. In addition, the law permits us to disclose personal information to the authorities without an individual's consent to protect the public interest (e.g. to combat fraud or money laundering) and to the courts to protect our business interests. 

A full listing of exceptions can be found in our Privacy Code. 

_Can I find out what information you have concerning me and who you have given it to?_

At any time, you can find out what personal information we have, what it is being used for and to whom it has been disclosed. In some unique situations, it may be inappropriate to provide you with certain information because it is commercial proprietary data, subject to solicitor-client privilege, or permitted by law for some other reason. We do not keep records on when personal information is disclosed for routine purposes such as cheque printing, tax reporting to the government, updating credit information to credit bureaus or indicating to third parties when cheques are returned NSF. We will do our best to provide the required information to you within a reasonable time period and will provide an explanation if we are unable to meet your request. Some inquiries may entail a charge, in which case we will provide an estimate of the amount in advance. 

_If my personal information is inaccurate, can it be changed?_

Yes, simply contact the Privacy Administrator in each HSBC office who can help you complete the necessary forms. We will correct inaccurate or incomplete information within a reasonable time and will notify you when we have done so. There is no charge for correcting your information. In the unlikely event we have given incorrect information to others, we will ensure they are advised of the required corrections. 

_How long do you keep personal information?_

We only keep your personal information on file for as long as we need it to provide you with service and to meet legal requirements. When we no longer need the information, it is either destroyed or made anonymous. 

_What safeguards do you have in place to keep personal information confidential?_

We use a variety of security measures such as restricting employee access to files and data centres, using fireproof and locked file cabinets, and employing a variety of electronic security measures, such as passwords, personal identification numbers and data encryption techniques. 

Only those employees who need personal information to provide service have access to it. It is a condition of employment that all HSBC employees conform to our Privacy Code and sign a written promise to observe the highest standards of confidentiality for each customer's personal information. 

_What do I do if I have questions, concerns or complaints relating to privacy?_

If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the way in which personal information is collected or used by HSBC please contact the Privacy Administrator found in each HSBC office. Alternatively, you can also contact :
