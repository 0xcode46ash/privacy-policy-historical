** Privacy Practices and Policies**   
HBO South Asia automatically collects website activity data that is used by us for internal review in aggregate form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifying data about visitors to this site are known to HBO South Asia when voluntarily submitted or posted to us. 

HBO South Asia uses this personally identifying data provided by visitors to contact visitors who communicate with us. Personally identifying data is collected primarily to enable HBO South Asia to mail additional information about HBO Asia/Cinemax to website visitors. For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as responding to comments or being notified if they have participated in one of our contests. If you at any point no longer wish to receive communications from HBO South Asia, please forward such requests to us at webmaster@hboasia.com.sg. 

**Kids-About Your Privacy**   
Kids should be sure to ask their parents for permission before sending any personal information over the internet. 

**A Special Notice For Parents**   
While HBO South Asia encourages children to consult with their parents before furnishing data, parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
