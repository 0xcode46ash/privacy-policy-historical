**Our Privileges List**

Registered Members who join the Privileges email list will receive announcements, promotions, deals and offers from selected advertisers.  

In such cases, HK Magazine Online performs the email service on behalf of the advertiser; your account or personal information is not provided to the advertiser.  However, if you respond to an offer contained in a Privilege email, the advertiser may choose to market to you in accordance with the laws of the country in which you live.

Based on the personal information you provide, HK Magazine Online may select members of the Privileges email list for greater relevance to the advertiser (e.g., selecting those who said they are interested in Restaurants and Food for a dining offer).

Privilege List members who also provide mobile phone information may receive SMS messages from Privileges advertisers.

**Registering with Facebook Connect**

The Facebook Connect platform may be used to register for this site.  If you choose to use the Facebook Connect option then Facebook's terms and conditions, guidelines and privacy policies also apply to your use of this site. By registering for our site with Facebook Connect you allow us to have access to certain information from your Facebook profile (eg: Name, e-mail address, gender, birthdate and location). When you provide this information you help us personalize your experience on our site by providing exclusive content and being able to contact you with news and offers. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through your Facebook Connect login.  Your activities on Facebook are covered by the [Facebook privacy policy](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php) and the [Facebook terms of use](http://www.facebook.com/terms.php) **.**

**Our Emailing Technology**

HK Magazine Online retains a third-party Vendor to provide its emailing services.  The Vendor hosts HK Magazine Online’s email lists on its own servers, and provides services and security which are industry standard.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on the Website.

**Public Forums  **

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**Online Store**

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. Credit card numbers for purchases made on our online store are collected by PayPal on our behalf and their privacy policies can be viewed at [Paypal Privacy Policy](https://cms.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&locale.x=en_US)

**Business Transfers**

We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.

**Terms and Conditions**

Users of HK Magazine Online websites and digital products are also subject to the [Terms and Conditions](http://hk-magazine.com/terms-conditions).
