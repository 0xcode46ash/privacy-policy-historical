# Privacy Policy | HK-magazine.com

In order to access some features of the Website, you will have to create an account or register as a member. HK Online collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users and send notifications related to the use of the service. HK Online also collects user-submitted profile information such as gender, age, etc.

Please note that:

* You may never use another's account without permission.

* When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.

* You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.

* You must notify HK Online immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

* Although HK Online will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of HK Online or others due to such unauthorized use.

* HK Online may use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve HK Online technologies and services.

* We may combine personal information collected from you with information from other HK Online services or third parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing content for you.

* We may share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.

* HK Online may also share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties in order to present to members more targeted advertising, products and services.

* As a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away personal information of our Registered Members.

* We will never disclose information that will be used to personally identify you. In the event that we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the services offered by HK Online on the Website without registering.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on the Website.

**Public Forums**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**Email/SMS Lists/Opt-out**

Users of the site may request to receive our electronic newsletters and SMS notifications and be added to our Email/SMS Lists.  From time to time, HK Online may allow qualified and carefully selected third parties to rent all or part of our Email and/or SMS Lists for the purposes of sending advertising, marketing or promotional messages to HK Online users.  By requesting to receive electronic newsletters or SMS notifications, users are expressly agreeing to receive such advertising, marketing or promotional messages.  In such cases, the Email/SMS List remains the property of HK Online and will not be released to the third party.  Users may choose to opt out from the Email and/or SMS Lists at any time. 

_**Business transfers**_

We are always seeking to improve our network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.
