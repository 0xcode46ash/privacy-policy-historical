# HexaTrack - Privacy Policy

At HexaTrack.com we take the privacy of your personal information very seriously. Please rest assured that we will not share your information with outside parties without your knowledge. The only exceptions to this rule would involve extraordinary circumstances: abiding to inquiries by law officials, protecting a HexaTrack member's safety, and legal matters involving HexaTrack.com. 

HexaTrack.com does not collect personal information like names or addresses when you simply visit our website. If you choose to provide that information with us it will only be used to fulfill your request for information. 

If you choose to provide us with personal information like filling out a Contact Us form with an e-mail address and zip code and submitting it to us through the website, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We will never share any of your information unless we have explicit permission from you or are required to do so by law (by direct request of an identified law enforcement agent). We will never sell any of your private information. 

On occasion, customer support requests and responses from our support staff may be posted in our forum to help others with similar questions. If we do so, we will make sure any of your information is kept private or blanked out. We will never post your name, email or URLs publicly without your permission.
