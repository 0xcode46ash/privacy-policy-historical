#### How do you process personal data?

We save and use your personal data only to process your orders and to get in touch with you. If you subscribe to our customer newsletter, we also use your email address to send it out. We will automatically send you status messages from hetzner-status.de if you have previously changed your settings on our customer administration interface in which you request these messages. We also save and process data that job applicants provide us as part of the job application process. 

  


#### What categories of data do we collect?

Every time you visit our website, your IP address and other pieces of information are saved in anonymized form. If you register an account with us, your contact information will be stored. If you order products from us, your address and payment information will also be stored. 

In particular, we save the following data from you.

  


#### Registration data

When you register an account with us, we collect and process certain personal data from you as your registration data. For example, we need your name, address information, telephone number, payment information and your email address to process your order. If you pay using a credit card, we do not collect and store any payment information such as credit card numbers or verification codes. You disclose this information only to the respective payment service provider. One exception with credit card payments is what is known as the pseudo card number: in order for you not to have to enter your credit card information for every payment, a pseudo card number is saved for your account. The pseudo card number only enables payment for products on our website that you order using your customer account. A pseudo card number is not identical to the credit card number. We delete all your registration data either: within 24 months, as soon as you delete your user account with us, or once the statutory retention period expires. You can delete your user account with us by sending an email to [data-protection@hetzner.com](mailto:data-protection@hetzner.com) with your deletion request. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. 

  


#### Email addresses

If you subscribe to our newsletter or request that you receive automated messages from [hetzner-status.com](https://www.hetzner-status.com/), we also store your email address. We delete your email address once you delete your user account or if you unsubscribe from our newsletter. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a or Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. 

  


#### Server log files

Whenever you visit our websites, we automatically store certain data. This includes your IP address, type and version of the browser you use, time, date, website from which you come to our site. Your IP address is saved for 7 days and then anonymized. You can then no longer be identified. The legal basis for this data process is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. 

  


#### Forum

If you register for our online discussion forum, we save your username and email address. After you delete your account in the forum, this saved data will also be deleted. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. 

  


#### Career portal

If you send us job application documents such as your resume, references and cover letter, we will save and process these pieces of data. Application documents from job applicants that do not result in hires are deleted after 3 months. If you wish to be considered for future job openings and you consent to a longer storage period, your application documents will be deleted after 24 months. With applications that result in hires, the documents are forwarded to our HR department. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the job application process is primarily Section 26 of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) in the new version, which became valid on May 25, 2018. 

  


#### Sweepstakes

We sometimes have sweepstakes on our websites for various occasions. If you choose to participate in the sweepstakes, we save your first and last names, your email address and, if applicable, the country you come from. We use the collected data only to process the sweepstakes. Once the sweepstakes end and the winner or winners are chosen and notified, the collected data are deleted. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. 

  


#### Who we forward your data to

External service providers may have access to your data while they assist us in providing our services. In some cases, third parties such as government authorities, external consultants, or our business partners may receive your data. 

  


#### In particular, this may occur in the following cases:

#### Domain registration

If we register a domain for you, we provide the required data to the corresponding registration service provider. 

  


#### Payment via credit card:

When paying via credit card, the payment is processed by an external service provider. For credit card payments, your information is collected directly by Computop at the address Computop Wirtschaftsinformatik GmbH, Schwarzenbergstr. 4, D-96050 Bamberg. 

  


#### Debt collection agency

If you as a customer fail to pay your invoices on time, your necessary data are passed on to an external debt collection agency. 

  


#### Job application documents

If you apply for a job in Tuusula, Finland or in Munich (Unterföhring) using our career portal, we pass on your job application documents to our subsidiaries at Hetzner Finland Oy or Hetzner Cloud GmbH. We have order processing contracts with both of them. 

  


#### Third countries

Data is transferred to third countries in adherence to the legally regulated admissibility requirements. We will not transfer your data to a third country if it does serve the purpose of performing our contract with you; we have no consent from you; the transfer is not necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; and there are no other exceptions, We will only transfer your data to a third country if there is an adequacy decision in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR. Once such adequacy decision (regarding an adequate level of protection) is the "Privacy Shield" for the USA. For transfers to a company certified under the Privacy Shield, the data privacy level is considered essentially as adequate within the meaning of Art. 45 GDPR. However, we usually do not rely on the Privacy Shield, but rather create appropriate privacy guarantees and complete the EU standard data privacy clauses issued by the European Commission with the receiving party. Together these actions establish appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR and provide an adequate level of protection.
