### What personal information is collected and how is it used?

#### Information Collected Directly from You and Others through this Site

We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information.

This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs and email offers; participate in surveys; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We collect information about you and, if you provide it, we collect information about those you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We may use information we collect about you and those you know to do things like:

  * Process your online orders;
  * Provide information so our personal shopper can assist you;
  * Open an online account at your request;
  * Personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;
  * Provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;
  * Include you in surveys and contests;
  * Enable you to post your content, such as comments or images;
  * Facilitate networks of online social activity centered on our products and services;
  * Improve our website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and improve the interactions visitors have with our website;
  * Enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and
  * Marketing our products and services that may be of interest to you.-for instance, we may add you to the Henri Bendel email list when you make an online purchase or sign up to receive emails, or we may add you to Henri Bendel’s print-catalogue list when you make an online purchase.



#### Information We Observe or Collect through Technology

Navigational Information

When you visit this Site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.

Cookies and Clear gif files

To better understand what you do while on our Site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our Site, provide better customer service, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history. 

We also use clear gif files (also known as a Web beacon, pixel tag or Web bug) on our Site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or email message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Site or email in question is viewed. Clear .gif files in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. These technologies may be used to help us see which interactive experiences online users like most for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to this Site.

Cookies and clear gif files also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses and email address). We'll associate this information: to deliver products and services; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services to you on this and other Web sites or through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

For information about your options with respect to cookies, see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.

#### INFORMATION OTHERS OBSERVE OR COLLECT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY

We evaluate and select third-party service providers to help us provide certain features on our Site and analyze our visitors’ site and purchase preferences. The following provides more information about these service providers.

Analysis

### How Is Technology Used To Serve Our Advertisements On Other Web Sites and What Choices Do You Have?

For information about opt out programs that these third party advertising companies participate in, and the effect of opting out, click the following: NAI Opt Out [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), DAA Opt Out—[click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), and Google Analytics Opt Out [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) (you'll then leave this Site for centrally managed online sites where you may specify your preferences under those programs). You can also click the preference icon that may appear on some of our advertising served through use of these technologies. You should also note that our systems may not recognize “Do Not Track” headers from some or all browsers.

### How does this Site interact with third-party Web sites and content?

We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. It is possible that the third party providing content through our Site may collect or observe information through its use of technology.  Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.

#### HERE'S A PARTIAL LIST OF THE SITES OR CONTENT OF THESE THIRD PARTIES:

  * **Interactive Maps**

We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.

  * **Inline Framing**

We may provide content on our Site that exists on other Web sites, such as live or recorded video, through a frame surrounded by content from our Site (this framed content is referred to as an iFrame). The iFrame is used to facilitate easy access to the content from the other Web site.

  * **Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites**

We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still in our Site environment. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

  * **Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites**

We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access or even "single sign-on" to these sites. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide at these sites.

  * **The Henri Bendel Credit Card Site**

We enable you to navigate easily to the site of Comenity Bank (Comenity), where you can apply for the A-list card and pay invoices online. Comenity issues and owns the A-list card accounts. When you apply online for an A-list card or pay your account online, you leave our Site and interact directly with Comenity. Any information you provide to Comenity is subject to Comenity’s terms, conditions, and policies, including its privacy policy.

  * **Third-Party Rewards or Membership Programs**

We may interact with certain unrelated companies that offer their customer memberships to participate in programs, which may include rewards for purchases from us. If you become a member of one of these programs or purchase something from us at this Site through such a program we may provide the company administering the membership program enough information about you or your purchase (like contact information, transaction date, transaction amount, and order number), to enable it to honor your membership. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs. Their terms, conditions, and policies apply to any information that is provided to them to further their program.

  * **International Checkout**

We work with eShopWorld to sell and deliver our products to certain international destinations. If you are shipping to a country supported by eShopWorld, you will navigate away from our Site to a co-branded checkout site “powered by eShopWorld.” We will notify you and provide a link to eShopWorld’s privacy policy when you navigate away from  our site.  Additionally, when you navigate to eShopWorld’s checkout site, we will share information about you and your order with eShopWorld to facilitate your purchase of our products from eShopWorld. eShopWorld’s privacy policy, and not our privacy policy, will apply to information that you directly provide on that site, such as your payment information. However, we and other parties will continue to use certain technologies, as described in Sections 2 (Information We Observe or Collect through Technology) and 3 (Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology) of this policy, to collect information about your online activities on that site. Please see eShopWorld’s privacy policy for information about its privacy practices.

We may share information about you with third parties, as described below, and as otherwise described in this policy:

#### OUR SISTER BRANDS

They help us do things like fulfill orders, provide some customer service through chat features, process payments, monitor site activity, serve surveys and provide analysis from the surveys when combined with website use, maintain databases, administer and monitor emails, administer and send mobile messages, serve ads on this and other Web sites as described above, and provide consulting services. Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites and mobile Web sites where you may provide personal information about you and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What personal information is collected and how is it used?)

#### OTHER MARKETERS

We may share your name, postal address, and purchase information with other merchants or merchant exchanges. Other merchants may, in turn, use this information to send you offers on their products and services. If you don’t want this information shared with these merchants and exchanges, please [click here.](http://www.henribendel.com/nondisclosure_form.html)

#### LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

We may disclose specific information about our Site visitors if we have a good-faith belief that it's necessary or authorized under the law to protect our customers, the public, or our business.

#### SALE, ACQUISITION, MERGER, OR OTHER REORGANIZATION

In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business assets, including a brand or line of business, or acquire another business entity or are involved in a corporate reorganization or other change of control, consumer information may be shared and may be one of the business assets that is transferred as part of the transaction.

Nothing in this policy restricts our ability to share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.

### What choices do you have over how your information is used?

#### EMAIL

If you make an online purchase or sign up to receive email, you may receive Henri Bendel email. You may stop future delivery of these emails by following the removal instructions located at the bottom of each commercial email. Opting out of any of these emails will not stop operational or transactional email messages such as password reset or account-related information from Henri Bendel. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive email messages from third parties. If you do opt in, we'll share your email address with the specific third party in question. Please review their privacy policies to see how they treat your personal information.

You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser's instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the "first-party" cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this Site. By first-party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our Site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our Site and other Web sites. Otherwise, clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the Site, you can elect to not take the survey.
