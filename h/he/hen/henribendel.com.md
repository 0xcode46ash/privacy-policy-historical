By "personal information" we mean (1) your identifying information (like name, home address, and email address), and also (2) descriptive information (like tastes and preferences) if coupled with your identifying information ("personally identifying information"). We may refer to ourselves as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy.

  * How is technology used to serve our advertisements on other Web sites and what choices do you have?
  * How does this site interact with third-party Web sites and content?

  * What is the policy for visitors from outside the U.S.?
  * How do you update your personal information?
  * How do we address children's privacy?

### Information Collected Directly from You and Others through this Site

We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information.

This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs and email offers; participate in surveys; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We collect information about you and, if you provide it, we collect information about those you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We may use information we collect about you and those you know to do things like:

  * process your online orders;
  * provide information so our personal shopper can assist you;
  * open an online account at your request;
  * personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;
  * provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;
  * include you in surveys and contests;
  * facilitate networks of online social activity centered on our products and services;
  * improve our website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and improve the interactions visitors have with our website;
  * enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and
  * market our products and services.



### Information We Observe or Collect through Technology

  1. Navigational Information  
When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.
  2. Cookies and Clear gif files  
To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase history. 

We also use clear gif files (also known as a Web beacon, pixel tag or Web bug) on our Web site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or email message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed. Clear .gif files in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. 

Cookies and clear gif files also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses and email address). We'll associate this information: to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services to you on this and other Web sites through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.




### Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology

We evaluate and select third-party service providers to help us provide certain features on our site and analyze our visitors’ site and purchase preferences. The following provides more information about these service providers.

  1. Features  
We use third-party services to provide certain features on our Web site. These third parties use some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology to provide these features.
  2. Analysis  
We use third-party analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web site, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. For instance, these third parties may serve surveys to determine satisfaction with the Web site and then tie the responses to actual behavior on the Web site, which will allow us to improve our Web site and Web capabilities. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology.

We contract with third-party advertising companies to deliver tailored online display and banner advertising to you on other Web sites. To serve this advertising, these third party companies place, use, or rely on technology, such as cookies and clear gifs, as customers interact with us through our Web sites and interact with other Web sites. Once this information is gathered, it helps us select tailored ads for placement on these other Web sites, based upon a customer’s shopping history and experience with us. These companies also provide information to us which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are.

For information about opt out programs that these third party advertising companies participate in, and the effect of opting out, click the following: NAI Opt Out [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA Opt Out—[click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (you'll then leave this site for centrally managed online sites where you may specify your preferences under those programs). You can also click the preference icon that may appear on some of our advertising served through use of these technologies. You should also note that our systems may not recognize “Do Not Track” headers from some or all browsers.

We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.

### Here's a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties:

  * **Interactive Maps**  
We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.
  * **Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites**  
We may rely on the expertise of third-party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you're still in our Web site environment. In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.
  * **Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites**  
We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access or even "single sign-on" to these sites. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide at these sites.

### Our Sister Brands

We may also share the information described in this policy, like postal and email address, customer preferences, and purchase history within our corporate family so that our affiliates or affiliated brands may market to you. They include, among others, such brands as Victoria’s Secret (including Victoria’s Secret PINK), Bath & Body Works, La Senza, and White Barn.

### Contractors

We use third-party "back-office" contractors to help handle parts of our business because of their expertise, resources, or scale. They help us do things like fulfill orders, process payments, monitor site activity, serve surveys and provide analysis from the surveys when combined with website use, maintain databases, administer and monitor emails, administer and send mobile messages, serve ads on this and other Web sites as described above, and provide consulting services. Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites and mobile Web sites where you may provide personal information about you and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What personal information is collected at our Web site, and how is it used?).

### Law Enforcement and Emergency Response

We may disclose specific information about our Web-site visitors if we have a good-faith belief that it's necessary or authorized under the law to protect our customers, the public, or our business.

### Sale, Acquisition, Merger, or Other Reorganization

In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business assets, including a brand or line of business, or acquire another business entity or are involved in a corporate reorganization or other change of control, consumer information may be shared and may be one of the business assets that is transferred as part of the transaction.

### Email

If you make an online purchase or sign up to receive email, you may receive Henri Bendel email. You may stop future delivery of these emails by following the removal instructions located at the bottom of each commercial email or by completing the removal from email form [Here](http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&aid=2088639758&n=3). Opting out of any of these emails will not stop operational or transactional messages such as email confirmations of your online orders, or customer service communications from Henri Bendel. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive email messages from third parties. If you do opt in, we'll share your email address with the specific third party in question. Please review their privacy policies to see how they treat your personal information.

### Postal Mail: Catalogs

If you would like to change your address or reduce your Henri Bendel Catalog mailings, please update your address in the My Account section. If you no longer wish to receive our catalogues, please call 1 (800) HBENDEL.

### Cookies and Clear Gifs

You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser's instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the "first-party" cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this site. By first-party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our site and other Web sites. Otherwise, clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the site, you can elect to not take the survey.

### Our Affiliates

If you don't want your contact and purchase information shared between our affiliates for marketing purposes, please call 1 (800) HBENDEL to make a request.
