# Privacy Policy | County of Henrico

## What information is collected during your visit to our web site?

When you visit the Henrico County website, the following information is collected automatically:

  1. The Internet Service Provider you use to access the Internet (for example, Verizon or Comcast).
  2. The date and time you visited.
  3. The pages you looked at.
  4. If you downloaded something, the file(s) you downloaded.



We use this information only in aggregate form (i.e., grouped together with everyone else’s, not by individual user). We look to see how many people visit the site, what the most popular pages on our site are, where there are broken links, etc.

## What if you voluntarily provide personally identifiable information?

Such information is treated the same way as if it had arrived in a letter. For example, suppose you use the [Restaurant Complaint Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20130607142545id_/http%3A//www.co.henrico.va.us/health/environmental-health/complaint/) to file a complaint about a restaurant in Henrico County. That page asks you to enter personally identifiable information such as your name, address, and phone number. The information is received by the appropriate agency, in this case, the Health Department, and only shared with other County agencies that might need the information to resolve the issue. The County of Henrico does not sell or market such information in any way, to anyone. The County of Henrico will disclose such information to third parties only when required to do so by law.

## Do we use “cookies?”

The County of Henrico does not use cookies except in its online job application process through [www.henricojobs.com](http://www.henricojobs.com/). Cookies on [www.henricojobs.com](http://www.henricojobs.com/) will only be used for the online job application process.

## Outside Links

Note: some County of Henrico web pages have links to web sites “outside” of the County’s web site. If you click on these links to visit other sites, you are subject to the privacy policies of those sites while you are visiting them, rather than the County’s policies.

## Why this policy?

The County has developed this policy because we are proud of our website. We believe it to be user-friendly, and we want you to feel comfortable visiting here, knowing that we are not collecting information about you to give to other people. This privacy policy is intended to be in compliance with the [Va. Code Section 2.2-3803](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?000+cod+2.2-3803).
