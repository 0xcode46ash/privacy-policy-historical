## Disclosure of Information

Our site offers several online services, where users can submit forms to various departments in the County to interact with various services or programs that the County offers. For example, suppose you use the [Restaurant Complaint Form](http://henrico.us/services/restaurant-complaint-form/) to file a complaint about a restaurant in Henrico County. That page asks you to enter personally identifiable information such as your name, address, and phone number. The appropriate agency receives this information, and can only share with other County agencies that might need the information to resolve the issue.

The County of Henrico does not sell or market such information in any way, to anyone. The County of Henrico will disclose such information to third parties only when required to do so by law enforcement.

GIS and other location-aware apps may use, only with your express permission, your geographical information to improve the functionality of the application. You may have seen this kind of location warning if you have a smartphone and have used on it any app that asks, “(This app) would like to use your current location,” and you accept or decline. If you decline, your location is not available in that application.
