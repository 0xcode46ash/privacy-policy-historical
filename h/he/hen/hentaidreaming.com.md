# Privacy Policy | Hentai Dreaming

**Consumer Information**  
HentaiDreaminge uses own or third party ad serving technology to serve ads at this site and at our clients’ sites. In the course of delivering an ad to you, the third party ad serving party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser and use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you

 **Cookies and Opt Out**  
Like most Internet sites, HentaiDreaminge and its third party ad serving party uses “cookies” to enhance the Internet user’s experience on the Web. Neither HentaiDreaminge nor such third party ad serving party uses these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.

 **What are cookies, and how do they enhance your web experience?**  
A cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time you are served an ad. This number is stored in a file on your computer. For instance, cookies help ensure that you don’t repeatedly see the same ad. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser’s site and the effectiveness of an ad. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs. In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested.  
Although we believe that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web (by not repeatedly serving the same ads to you and delivering more relevant messages to you), neither HentaiDreaminge nor its third party ad serving party needs cookies to deliver ads to you.
