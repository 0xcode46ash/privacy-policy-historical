### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All our employees use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to protected information. Furthermore, ALL employees are updated as to our security and privacy practices. Every month, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the physical servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure collocation facility, within locked cages that only HemsTMMail network administrators have access to. This facility provides security 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and guaranties our servers against power outages by using automated backup power systems.
