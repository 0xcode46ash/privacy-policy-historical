This Privacy Statement covers Helpshift's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Helpshift gathers when you access/use the Service.

### What personal information does Helpshift collect?

Helpshift collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, payment related information (credit card number, physical address, etc.), etc.

In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. We may also use "cookies" to track your experience and use of the Service.

Much of the foregoing information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data. That said, this information may be compiled (or organized) with personally identifiable information you submit to the Service (such as, for the purposes of creating user profiles).

In addition, parts of the Service may be hosted by a third party on our behalf. Your information may be accessed by such providers/agents, in the event that we need to share your information with them to provide our services or customer support to you. Unless we tell you differently, Helpshift's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Helpshift may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

**Protection of Helpshift and Others:** We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Helpshift, our employees, our users, or others.
