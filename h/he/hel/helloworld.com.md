UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL EMAIL POLICY

VMdirect will never send Unsolicited Bulk Commercial Email (UCE) for itself or on behalf of clients. VMdirect has a zero tolerance policy for UCE, also referred to as SPAM.

VMdirect employs a suppression list mechanism to prevent recipients who have chosen to opt-out of receiving rich media messaging regardless of any specific client lists from receiving mail. This mechanism is in place if VMdirect sends the email on behalf of clients.

VMdirect will never deploy a videoMail campaign on behalf of a client without a publicly available privacy policy and at least one method of opt-out.

VMdirect scrutinizes all lists received from clients to determine a high level of confidence that the list is indeed opt-in. If VMdirect, at it's sole discretion determines that the list is flawed in any manner with respect to permission, it will not be used and a specific videoMail campaign may be discontinued.

PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR VMdirect VIDEOMAIL DELIVERY

From time to time, VMdirect stores database files and email addresses for clients. These files are used to deliver email on behalf of clients only. Client lists are NEVER shared with other clients or aggregated in any manner. All client files stored by VMdirect remain the property of the original client. Security of client data is of the highest priority.

VMdirect can track recipient actions within an email if the email client/browser is html capable. The tracking elements reported to clients are whether a recipient has opened the message, estimated recipient connection speed, whether the recipient viewed the video content, time the content was viewed, whether the recipient clicked a link(s), which links were clicked, whether the message was forwarded. Text only email messages cannot be tracked. This tracking is used to help deliver the best content based on connection speed and to determine return on investment for the client. 

All tracking is done on behalf of clients and will be reported only to the client that owns any specific campaign. Recipient specific tracking information is never shared with any third parties. Expired campaign data is routinely purged from our systems within thirty days of said expiration.
