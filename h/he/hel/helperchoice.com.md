# Privacy Policy | HelperChoice

At HelperChoice we care about the privacy of individuals who visit the website and individuals who register to use our services. All our decisions are made with our members’ best interest at heart. We have drafted this Privacy and Practices Statement as clearly as possible so you are aware of what is going on with respect to your privacy on HelperChoice.

HelperChoice aims to connect employers and domestic helpers globally to allow them to find the right match efficiently. Our registered members can upload their profiles, contact others for hiring and employment opportunities. Helper profiles and employer ads are visible to unregistered visitors, but they have no access to contact information such as full name, email and telephone. Helpers can contact employers only through HelperChoice’s online messaging system. Premium employers can see the domestic helpers phone number if domestic helpers have shared this information on their profile. The interest of all our members are central to our business ethics. 

Maintaining your trust is important to us. Our members’ privacy is a priority at HelperChoice, and we are committed to protecting all parties who use our services. We do not share any data with third parties except when we must comply with government department regulations. Please read further to learn more about our practices, including what type of information is collected, how the information is used and to whom we disclose the information, and how we maintain security with shared information.
