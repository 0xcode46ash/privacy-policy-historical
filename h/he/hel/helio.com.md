**HELIO, INC. PRIVACY POLICY**

Last Revised: 10/25/05

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your wireless experience as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. HELIO, Inc. has adopted this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how HELIO, Inc. collects information from users ("Users") of HELIO, Inc. services (the "Services") and visitors ("Visitors") to our Website, how we use the information we collect and the choices you have concerning the collection and use of such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

**Collection and Use of Information**

Users are asked to provide certain information when they sign up for our Services such as name, address, telephone number, billing information (for example, a credit card number), and the type of personal computer or wireless product being used to access the Services. This information is used to manage each User's account (such as billing and collections). HELIO, Inc. may collect some additional information from Visitors and Users who use various aspects of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized User experience. HELIO, Inc. also collects consumer information about its Users through surveys or preference pages. We use registration information to contact you in a variety of ways. We may send you offers of HELIO, Inc. products and services or offers on behalf of selected affiliates by email, telephone or regular mail. If you order products directly from HELIO, Inc., we will use your information to continue to provide you products that you are interested in. You may opt-out from receiving marketing information from us-see the section titled "Opt Out", below, for details. HELIO, Inc. may also generate aggregate profiles (e.g. statistics that do not identify particular individuals) from information provided during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Users). We may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services, and to develop products and offers to better serve our Users. 

**Disclosures to HELIO, Inc. Affiliates**

HELIO, Inc. may share personal information with select affiliated companies (including EarthLink, Inc.) in order to provide HELIO, Inc. Services to our Users. Our affiliates are not allowed to sell, rent or give away any identifying information about you to any other non-affiliated company. Affiliates are not allowed to use HELIO, Inc. data for any other purpose other than HELIO, Inc. approved programs designed to better serve Users. In instances where HELIO, Inc. and an affiliate jointly promote the Services, HELIO, Inc. may provide the affiliate certain personal information in order to facilitate the joint promotion. In that case, the information may not be used by the affiliate for any purpose other than promoting the joint offering or providing you the specific products and services you request. Disclosure by HELIO, Inc. to Non-Affiliated Third Parties We will never sell your information to a third party. Some HELIO, Inc. products and services are offered to Users in conjunction with a third-party vendor. To provide these products and services, the vendor may need your personal information. Additionally, many HELIO, Inc. Users have co-branded Personal Start Pages that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. HELIO, Inc. may also share non-identifying and aggregate consumer information with these third parties in order to more effectively market our co-branded products or services offered to our customers. We do not allow third parties to use your information for purposes other than providing the services you request and those purposes described in this policy. 

**Online Shopping**

At some Websites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. HELIO, Inc. has no control over third-party Websites and their use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. 

**Voluntary Surveys**

We may periodically conduct both business and individual surveys. We encourage Users to participate in these voluntary surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Users to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use this information to improve the quality of our services, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated; non-personally identifying information may be shared with affiliates or third parties. 

**Special Cases**

It is HELIO, Inc.'s policy not to use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the purposes for which you give it to us without also providing an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, HELIO, Inc. may disclose personal information or information regarding use of the Services if, for any reason, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, regulations or other legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other policies; if we have a reason to believe that doing so may protect someone's personal safety; to operate the Services properly; or to protect HELIO, Inc., our Services, our employees or our Users. 

**"Cookies" and How HELIO, Inc. Uses Them**

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit Websites. HELIO, Inc. may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to operate and improve the products and services we provide and to manage our network and property. If you are using an EarthLink Wireless Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-HELIO, Inc. Websites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. In most cases, the information that a cookie collects does not identify you, however, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. 

**HELIO, Inc.'s Commitment to Children's Privacy**

Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. This website is not intended for children 13 years and under. You must be at least 13 years old to submit information to our website. In addition, you must be at least 18 to purchase our products or Services. HELIO, Inc. does not knowingly collect information from any person under the age of 13. If we become aware that a person under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to this website, we will promptly delete such information. HELIO, Inc. may have products and web pages designed especially for younger users under the direct supervision of an adult User. While we make every effort to ensure that these Services are fun and age-appropriate for a younger audience, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly Websites and how to report online trouble, please visit www.getnetwise.org. HELIO, Inc. recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending any personal information anywhere using the Internet. 

**Public Forums**

You should assume that any information you disclose in public areas of our Websites or elsewhere on the Internet will become public information. You should exercise caution and good sense when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas. 

**HELIO, Inc.'s Commitment to Data Security**

HELIO, Inc. has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
