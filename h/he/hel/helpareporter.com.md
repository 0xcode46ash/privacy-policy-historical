This Privacy Policy covers HARO's treatment of personal or personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that may be collected when you are on the HelpAReporter.com website, and when you use the services of HelpAReporter.com. The privacy of your nonpublic information is important to us. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address and any other personally identifiable information.

HelpAReporter.com is sensitive to the protection of customer identifiable information which an individual or another customer reasonably expects to be kept private. Customer identifiable information means information which can be associated with a specific entity or individual, including, by way of example, a customer's name, e-mail address, and information about on-line activities which can be directly linked to him or her.

If you become a HARO Source member, we will create an account for you, at HelpAReporter.com, which will contain your name, e-mail, and other identifying information. This account will be used to send out the periodic emails.

This information will be displayed on our emails we send out to the Source Members listing your request for information. If you post a request for information anonymously, we will create a Google filter for incoming emails which will then forward those emails which properly comply with the instructions to you. We will receive copies of those emails as well as any responses which did not properly comply with the instructions. HARO may also collect Personal Information from your usage of the HelpAReporter.com website.
