# Privacy & Security | Helix Sleep

FREE U.S. SHIPPING & ZERO HASSLE RETURNS.

Effective Date of Current Policy: August 25, 2015

This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Helix Sleep, Inc. Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). The term “Helix,” “we,” and “us” includes Helix Sleep, Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries. The Privacy Policy explains how Helix may collect, use and disclose information we obtain through the Site. All other terms not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Terms.

**“Personal Information”** means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

## THE SITE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION

We collect Personal Information when you register to use the Site; use the Site; and communicate with us. We also collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Site. 

Personal Information Collection. When you purchase a Mattress, you are given the option to register with the Site. If you do not register, you may checkout as a guest. In any event, when you purchase a Mattress, you must provide us with Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and address. In addition, given that we will customize your Mattress based on certain of your physical attributes, we will also ask you to provide, among other things, your height, weight, body shape match, age bracket, gender, sleeping preference and sleeping pains/allergies.

Using the Site. We collect information you post through the Site. For example, when you interact with other users by posting a review, the Site will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information.

When you visit the Site, we and our third-party service providers receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and from cookies and similar technology. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not work properly.

By using the Site, you are authorizing us to gather, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the Site.

Opt-Out. As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
