# HeyWire - Privacy Policy

**This Privacy Policy was last updated on  ** **February 19, 2016**

### 1\. DEFINITIONS & OVERVIEW

When you interact with the Services, we may collect both personal information and non-personal information from you.

**“Personal Information”**  means information that specifically identifies an individual, such as name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.

**“Non-personal Information”**  means information about the characteristics and activities of an individual from which any Personal Information has been removed, such as IP address, type of browser or mobile device used, mobile device identifier(s), aggregate interests of individuals (e.g. visits to sports sites), etc. Nothing in this policy limits our use of non-personal information.

In addition to adhering to federal and state privacy laws, we also adhere to the Mobile Marketing Association’s Global Code of Conduct, guidelines established by the Internet Marketing Association and other industry guidelines in order to protect you and your identity.

We will  **never sell or give**  your Personal Information to any third party, except as provided herein, without your consent. We collect certain information either directly from you, or indirectly through logs and other technologies. This information is used to improve and provide the services to you.

### 2\. INFORMATION THE COMPANY COLLECTS FROM YOU

**Direct Information Collection**

When you register for Services, we collect a variety of Personal Information, including your name, phone and e-mail address.

We have the right, but not the obligation, to store any messages that pass through our Services as well as other message information.

We may also receive information about you from other sources. This information may be combined with information we collect. We do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in aggregate (non-personal) form in connection with providing the Services.
