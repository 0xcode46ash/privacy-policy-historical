# Heyo

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

Please note that Heyo is primarily an activity that is shared with friends. The primary information users post to Heyo is a future location. User future location data is only shown to “friends”, where friends on Heyo refers to those you have requested and received confirmation from, or who have requested friendship from you and you have confirmed. All other user data shared on Heyo (whether directly through our site or via links with other social networking websites) is instantly viewable to all Heyo users, including Friends, Pending Friends, and users who are not connected as Friends. This includes but is not limited to links to other social networking profiles (such as Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, etc.), “Pages” marked as “Fave” by the user, user’s confirmed Friends on Heyo, and user’s first name and last initial. Therefore, you should not submit information that you consider confidential. We maintain the privacy of your email address, password, phone number, and birth date submitted to us in the registration process or at any other time, but other information you provide should be considered nonconfidential and available for viewing by others.

### The Information We Collect

Any information gathered by Heyo is used to customize the Heyo experience, and is not shared or sold to any third parties, except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we use industry standard methods to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, although you recognize that data transmitted online or stored in a facility to which online access is provided cannot be made to be 100% secure. We believe in protecting your information just as we would want our information protected.

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Heyo will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised as may be required by applicable law.

Please note that information you enter for your user profile or in your posts may be accessed and viewed by others and therefore you should not post information that you consider confidential or that you do not want distributed publicly, or to your friends on Heyo in the case of future location data.

### Notifications

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our users via e-mail notice, via a mobile device, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Heyo website, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Heyo reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users.

### Child Protection

We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.

### Local Law

There are cases in which local law requires that users be of a certain age, such as 18 or 21 in order to view certain content. Users may be asked to input their date of birth either at registration or another time during the use of the application in order to access this content.

### How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

You can access your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in and viewing your profile page. Not all profile information is immediately available to be edited, but we plan to build in this functionality shortly. In the meantime, please email us at help@heyo.com if any profile information is inaccurate. Your password may be required to edit this information, even if you are already logged in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You may not be able to edit or delete past entries and information collected regarding past updates.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. The main form of identity management is your e-mail address. Please always use a valid and up-to-date e-mail address.

### Use of User Information

Information you provide to us about yourself, or that we collect and infer based upon your entries and posts to Heyo may be used to improve your user experience, provide or suggest targeted services and to allow third party advertises and messaging to be tailored or targeted. We may use or provide to third parties aggregated data entered by users or inferred from usage. We may collect IP addresses and cookies for the primary purpose of assisting with ease of use by you, and for protecting our infrastructure and user data from those with malicious intent. However, except as legally required, we will not sell or provide your email address, IP address, cookies, address or phone number to third parties for advertising or other purposes.
