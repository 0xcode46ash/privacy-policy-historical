### 3\. When Heyzap Discloses Information:

Please be aware that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network - such as when you publish contact information to complete your profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

Heyzap may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, Application types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network. Heyzap may share your information with third parties with whom Heyzap has a strategic relationship, such as advertisers. The information shared with these third parties may be used for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions or demographic profiling. Heyzap may also provide your information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods and services Heyzap believes will be of interest to you.

We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; for advertising attribution; and to assist Heyzap in improving the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network and creating new services features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.

Heyzap may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.

### 4\. Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Heyzap. However, this means you will be unable to use the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network.

In the event you are both an Apple user and have chosen to opt out of sharing your personal data, the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network will be unable to store and use your data.

### 5\. Advertisers

Heyzap allows other companies, called advertisers, third-party ad servers or ad networks, referred to herein as “Advertisers,” to serve advertisements within the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network and the Heyzap Network. Heyzap shares information, including your data, with its advertisers and publishers of games and/or services that connect to the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network. Heyzap may use technology to send, directly to mobile devices, the advertisements that appear within the Heyzap Network and Application and will receive automatically collected information when this happens. Heyzap may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content. Please note that if an advertiser asks Heyzap to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the Advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. Heyzap does not permit the use of behavioral advertising or advertising specifically targeted toward children under 13 years of age.

While we encourage our advertisers to respect your privacy and the law, we take no responsibility for the services and advertisements provided by our advertisers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party Advertisers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers. Heyzap reserves the right to add or remove Advertisers at its discretion and Heyzap may not at all times list such updated ad network partners in this Privacy Policy.

### 6\. Advertisers and COPPA

Heyzap will not knowingly target any advertisements to children under the age of 13. Heyzap will not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13, and if we become aware of the collection of such knowledge, will purge that information from our systems immediately.

By using the Heyzap Application and/or the Heyzap Network, advertisers are agreeing not to use our services to provide advertisements to children under 13 and are ensuring their own compliance to COPPA standards. The Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network is not to be used in any child-directed advertisements. The Heyzap Application and/or Network is to be used only for contextual targeting and any use of behavioral advertising will result in the advertiser’s account being terminated immediately. If an advertiser becomes aware that their advertisements have come into conflict with COPPA, the advertiser is required to report this to Heyzap immediately. We rely on our advertisers to report any conflicts to us and do not maintain an aggressive enforcement program regarding our advertisers. If, however, you feel that any advertisers are not in compliance with COPPA or other regulations, we encourage you to contact us.

### 7\. Developers and COPPA

By using the Heyzap Application and/or the Heyzap Network, developers are agreeing not to use our services to provide applications to children under 13 and are ensuring their own compliance to COPPA standards.

If a developer becomes aware that their applications have come into conflict with COPPA, the developer is required to report this to Heyzap immediately. We rely on our developers to report any conflicts to us and do not maintain an aggressive enforcement program regarding our developers. If, however, you feel that any developers are not in compliance with COPPA or other regulations, we encourage you to contact us.

### 8\. Our Commitment to Data Security:

Heyzap uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Heyzap, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Heyzap makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Heyzap learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Heyzap may post a notice on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@Heyzap.com.

### 9\. Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, Heyzap does not allow users under 13 years of age to access the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network nor does Heyzap knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. Heyzap requires that partners confirm their audience does not target, in whole or in part, users under the age of the 13. If Heyzap learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network, then Heyzap will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network member, then please contact Heyzap at privacy@Heyzap.com to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.

By providing any data on the Heyzap Application and/or Heyzap Network, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United States or other countries.

### 11\. In the Event of Merger or Sale:

### 12\. Third Parties
