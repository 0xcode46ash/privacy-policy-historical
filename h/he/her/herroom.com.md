> **What the heck are cookies and should I worry about them?**
> 
> Cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites use to make online navigation easier. This data is contained on your hard drive in a file which your web browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites.

> HerRoom does not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to anyone. We do supply information for the purpose of billing and shipping your order. In other words, we do get approval from the credit card company and do give the shipper your address. The other form of third party information that may be used is personally identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them; or, if you complete a "tell a friend" form on our site. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1) comply with the law, 2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or 3) protect the rights, property, or safety of HerRoom and our users, or others.
