When I visit HerRoom, what information is gathered about me and why?

HerRoom does collect certain customer information. We use this information to process orders, enhance your shopping experience and communicate with our customers. 

We use order forms that allow you to buy our products. We collect your name, e-mail address, postal address, and credit card information. This information is used to process and send orders. We also use this information to contact you in case there is a question or problem with an order. 

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may collect your name, e-mail address, and other demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. We use this contact information to send you information about our company and to contact you, if necessary. 

We also use data collected when you register, enter a contest, and make purchases to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. If you give us permission, we will send you email about HerRoom updates and product offerings. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this website. We log IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to track a user's specific session, or to investigate cases of fraud or other security violations on our site. Any personally identifiable information contained in our IP address logs will be treated with the same respect for your privacy that order and registration information is treated. 

What the heck are cookies and should I worry about them?

Cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites use to make online navigation easier. This data is contained on your hard drive in a file which your web browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and, if you choose to register with us or request to receive email from HerRoom, to deliver content specific to your interests. You do not need to have cookies turned on to view our site, but you will need to accept cookies to register or order products. 

Who else has access to the information I provide to HerRoom?

HerRoom does not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to anyone. We do supplement financial information for the purpose of billing and shipping your order. In other words, we do get approval from the credit card company and do give the shipper your address. The other form of third party information that may be used is personally identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them; or, if you complete a "tell a friend" form on our site. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1) comply with the law, 2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or 3) protect the rights, property, or safety of HerRoom.com and our users, or others. 

How do I manage how much information I share or if I share any at all?

You can opt out of receiving e-mail and other communications from us. You can also update and/or correct any information about yourself that you've provided to HerRoom. Just by contact us using any of the ways listed at the top of this page. 

What is HerRoom doing to protect my privacy?

This site has security measures in place to protect from the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. Our servers use encrypted methods for those pages which contain personally identifiable data, including your credit card and address. We routinely and zealously monitor and upgrade our security systems to ensure that we use the best security technology available. 

We at HerRoom are sincerely committed to a safe and secure web experience for our visitors. If, after reading all this, you have concerns or questions, by all means, get in touch with us.
