While the Owner will attempt to ensure that the profiles or statistical data cannot be linked to you, the Owner does not guarantee that third parties may not be able to link such profiles and statistical data to you. You hereby indemnify the Owner against any loss, liability, expense, claim, penalty or damage suffered by you, whether direct, indirect, special or consequential, arising from or in relation to any third party being able to link such profiles and statistical data to you.

**5\. With whom is your information shared?**

5.1 While the Owner will attempt not to disclose any of your personal information to third parties, except when the Owner has your permission or it is in the legitimate business interests of the Owner, the Owner does not guarantee that your personal information will not be shared with third parties without your permission.

5.2 Your personal information may also be shared under the following circumstances:

5.2.1 Where the law requires that the Owner disclose your personal information.

5.2.2 To monitor web traffic. Web servers serving the Website automatically collect information about pages you visit. This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. This information – as well as information from third-party market researchers – is provided to advertisers advertising on the Website on an aggregated, anonymous basis. Should you provide personal information online as part of an online advertising promotion or in order to access a third-party service, such information may be provided directly to the advertiser or the third party concerned.

5.2.3 Promotions. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors or third parties. When you request more information about a particular promotion, your e-mail address may be shared with the sponsor of that promotion.

5.2.4 Online shopping. If you make a purchase from an online store or merchant, the information obtained during your visit to those stores (including tracking information, cookies, credit card number and contact information) is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place.

5.2.5 Third parties. Online merchants providing services in association with the Owner have separate privacy and data collection practices. You agree that the Owner has no responsibility or liability for third-party policies. For more information regarding the merchant, its store and its privacy policy, return to that store’s home page and click on the appropriate link.

5.2.6 Editorial purposes. Your personal information may be used by the Owner for editorial purposes. For example, this may include information you provide during an online survey conducted by our editors.

5.2.7 Legal purposes. The Owner may also disclose your personal information in special cases, where the Owner has reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a party who may be breaching the Terms and Conditions or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the Owner’s rights or property, other users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

5.2.8 For statistics and advertisement purposes. The Owner may perform statistical analyses in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Website (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers how many consumers have seen or “clicked” on their advertising banners. The Owner also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners on the Website to be targeted, in aggregate.

5.3 What are cookies and how are they used?

5.4 Cookies are pieces of information a website transfers to a user’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make surfing the web easier for you by saving your preferences; tracking your online habits and traffic patterns; and making sure you do not see the same advertisement too often. The use of cookies is an industry standard.

5.5 The Owner may place a “cookie” on your browser to store and sometimes track information about you.

5.6 While most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please, note that some parts of the Website will not function properly if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from third-party advertisers. The Owner does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party advertisers is an industry standard.

**6\. Use of IP address**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it is connected to the internet. The Owner also logs IP addresses, or the location of computers on the internet. The Owner collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of the Website. The Owner does not ordinarily link IP addresses to personal information, which means your session may remain anonymous. However, the Owner cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. For example, it may be necessary to identify a particular user when it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Terms and Conditions or to protect our Website service, customers or other interests.

**7\. Links to other sites**

When you are on the Website, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond the Owner’s control. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, collect data or solicit personal information. The Owner does not control the privacy policies of any advertisers, sponsors or other third-party web sites.

**8\. Security**

The importance of security for all personal information associated with you is of the utmost concern to us. While the Owner exercises great care in providing secure transmission of your personal information, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Owner cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from this Website.

**9\. Email**

The Owner may periodically send e-mails to you about services, products or promotions offered by the Owner and its advertisers to the e-mail address provided by you.

**10\. Individuals under 13 years of age**

HeraldLIVE encourages parents, teachers and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Website. No information (including personal information) should be submitted to or posted on the Website by any person under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent, teacher or guardian.
