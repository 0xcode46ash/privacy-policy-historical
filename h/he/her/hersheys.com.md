# Privacy Policy - HERSHEY'S

Welcome to The Hershey Company Internet web sites!   
We are proud to have this opportunity to tell you a little about our company, our products and our history. Along the way, we also hope you have some fun. Before you begin exploring, we'd like to review the steps we have taken to ensure that on-line visitors of all ages have a safe, enjoyable experience. 

  
Your privacy is important to us. At **** The Hershey Company, we value our consumer's privacy and have made it our policy to provide on-line content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our on-line information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. Any significant changes to this Privacy Policy shall be printed in blue italics for a period of 30 days. 

  
We take seriously our responsibility to our many young consumers. Our sites have been designed to be fun, accessible, safe for kids of all ages, and to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. Children under the age of 13 and their parents should review the section of this policy called "A Word to Parents About Kids’ Privacy" which discusses the special steps we take for young children who may visit our pages. 

  
Below are some of the ways in which a visitor may provide information to us on-line and how we may use that information. 

  
Our web servers automatically recognizes a visitor's domain name, however, they do not recognize a visitor's e-mail. 

  
Cookies and web beacons __ are small bits of information that a web site transfers to an individual's computer for record keeping purposes. We use cookies in a variety of ways to create a more personalized on-line experience for the user. For example, cookies may be used to enhance your experience with games, to reduce the number of repeat questions provided, to ensure that a promotion is not entered more than the permitted number of times, to create a recipe box, or to monitor how effective our ads on third party sites are at bringing visitors to our web pages. The Hershey’s Gifts web site located at _[HersheyGifts.com](http://www.hersheygifts.com/HDG_Home.aspx)_ and Mauna Loa web site at _[MaunaLoa.com](http://www.maunaloa.com/)_ , use cookies to keep track of your shopping bag. These cookies contain no personal information about you and no one but Hershey’s Gifts or Mauna Loa can retrieve the cookies. We use a cookie in the Hershey’s Kitchens area when you build a recipe box. This cookie is the key to your recipe box and is stored within your browser. The purpose for this cookie is to allow the system to recognize you as a return visitor and populate your recipe box with the recipes you have added. On our Investor Relations web site, a cookie is used for user profile verification. Personally identifiable information which may be obtained through cookies or web beacons is not sold, rented or provided to third parties and is not used internally by The Hershey Company for any purpose other than to enhance your experience on our web site. 

We do not require visitors to register or provide any information before entering our web sites. However, there are several places where visitors may choose to provide personally identifiable information about themselves or other people. Unless we tell you otherwise, Hershey will use the information for the purpose the information was provided.

For example:

  * **Questions** : On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. The only personally identifiable information that we collect is the sender’s e-mail address. We do not save any personally identifiable information associated with comments, and we only save e-mail addresses associated with questions in order to respond to those questions. 

  * **E-Cards** : Visitors to some of our pages can send electronic cards by providing the name and  e-mail address for the sender and recipient. The information provided cannot be viewed by Hershey. The information is used only to allow the sender and recipient to view the e-card and is then automatically deleted. 

  * **Promotions & Sweepstakes**: We frequently offer __ promotions and sweepstakes on our pages. In order to enter a promotion and/or sweepstake or to access certain web site content, we might require you to register online. All visitors under the age of 13 must gain permission from a parent or guardian prior to completing their online registration. During the registration process, we collect information necessary for prize fulfillment and will not share this information with any third party companies unless it is for prize fulfillment purposes. If a prize is valued at over $600, a social security number will be requested. Your online registration may be used across our web sites to enter multiple promotions and/or sweepstakes or to access certain content. The first initial, last name, hometown and state of all winners will be included on a Winners List. The Winners List will be provided upon request and as required by law.

This information is required to process and confirm your order and is retained to provide you with the ability to maintain an on-line mailing list and to track past gift selections. On occasion we make our Hershey’s Gifts and Mauna Loa customer list of names and mailing addresses (but not e-mail addresses or phone numbers) available to carefully screened companies with products we think may be of interest to our customers.

  * **Job Applications:** We will use the information submitted in on-line job applications for the sole purpose of filling the specific position applied for by the applicant. After this position is filled, we will retain the information submitted for the period of time required by applicable law. During this retention period, the application will be considered inactive, and the applicant will be considered for other positions only if he/she submits an additional application for those specific positions.

Business Partners

We have some business partners with whom we may operate some of our pages and share information. For example, on occasion we may offer a sweepstakes jointly with another company. In such instances, information may be shared with the co-sponsor so that the sweepstakes may be conducted. Another situation in which information may be shared is when we have licensed our trademarks to another company to manufacture or distribute a particular product. HERSHEY’S MILK, for example, is distributed by Morningstar Foods, a subsidiary of Dean Foods. Accordingly, information received by the HERSHEY’S MILK web site is shared by Hershey, Morningstar Foods and Dean Foods. Dean Foods can be contacted at [**webmaster@deanfoods.com**](mailto:webmaster@deanfoods.com). Morningstar Foods can be contacted at [**webmaster@suiza.com**](mailto:webmaster@suiza.com).

Aggregate Information

Aggregate information about which pages visitors access or visit (for example, to enter a visitor in a contest or to send the visitor information) is only used for internal review as we continue to improve our web site. This information is not sold to or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We do not rent, sell, or share e-mail addresses with any other company or organization.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on-line.

A Word To Parents About Kids’ Privacy

Our Privacy Policy applies to children as well as adults. There are some extra precautions that we take, however, with respect to collecting information from children under 13.

  * We encourage parents to explore our web sites with their children.
  * All promotion entrants will be requested to provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 on-line without first obtaining permission from the child’s parent or guardian. When a child under 13 years old attempts to register for a promotion or sweepstakes, we send their parent or guardian an e-mail to get their permission to collect the child’s personally identifiable information as part of their registration. If we do not receive permission within 14 days, we will delete the child’s request and they will not be able to complete their registration or enter any promotions online. Once a parent or guardian gives their permission for their child to register, the parent will be asked to complete the child's mailing information on behalf of the child.  When complete, the child will be able to enter future registration-based sweepstakes or contests without any further requests of consent to the parent; however the parent will be notified when the child enters a promotion.  Should the child's personally identifiable information require updating, the parent will be required to make any and all updates to their child's online registration information on behalf of the child. If a child under 13 is a winner, we will contact you and/or your child by e-mail for prize fulfillment purposes.
  * We do not require a child to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. (You may wish to be aware that, according to the FTC, web site operators are not permitted to collect more information than is needed for a child to participate in an on-line activity.)
  * Our web sites do not offer activities that allow your child or Hershey to disclose your child’s personal information publicly (for example through chat rooms or message boards).
  * We do not share your child’s personally identifiable information with third parties.
  * If you would like to review personally identifiable information about your child that we have on file, or request that certain information be changed or deleted, please contact:
