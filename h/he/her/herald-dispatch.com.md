# herald-dispatch.com Privacy Policy <span class="story_bodycopy"> <p>The following Privacy Policy governs herald-dispatch.com’s online information collection practices. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that herald-dispatch.com gathers about you while you are using the herald-dispatch.com website (the “Service”), and the ways in which herald-dispatch.com uses this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). <p> Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting the herald-dispatch.com website, you agree that your use of our Service, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our <A href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS01/50812001">Terms of Service</A>. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the herald-dispatch.com website after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified. <p> <b>Your California Privacy Rights</b> <p> California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: <p> Online Privacy Coordinator<br> Newspaper Division<br> 7950 Jones Branch Drive<br> McLean, VA 22107<br> <p> <b>How We Collect and Use Information</b> <p> We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Service (e.g., while on the herald-dispatch.com site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the herald-dispatch.com site). <p> We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Service. For example, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the herald-dispatch.com site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie” to enhance your experience on the herald-dispatch.com website. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the herald-dispatch.com, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique browsers visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the herald-dispatch.com site where you may have entered preference information before. herald-dispatch.com also may use web beacons (also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the herald-dispatch.com site or open herald-dispatch.com’s HTML-formatted email messages. <p> herald-dispatch.com uses the information it collects from you while you are using the Service in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Service. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us otherwise, herald-dispatch.com reserves the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Service in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable herald-dispatch.com or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-party vendors. <p> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides herald-dispatch.com. herald-dispatch.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information. <p> Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Service also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours.
