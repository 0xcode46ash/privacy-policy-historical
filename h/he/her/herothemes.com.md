# HeroThemes Privacy Policy

It is HeroTheme’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, HeroThemes collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. HeroThemes’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how HeroThemes’ visitors use its website. From time to time, HeroThemes may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

HeroThemes also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on HeroThemes blogs/sites. HeroThemes only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to HeroThemes’ websites choose to interact with HeroThemes in ways that require HeroThemes to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that HeroThemes gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [HeroThemes](https://herothemes.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with HeroThemes are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, HeroThemes collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with HeroThemes. HeroThemes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

HeroThemes may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. HeroThemes may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, HeroThemes does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

HeroThemes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on HeroThemes’ behalf or to provide services available at HeroThemes’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using HeroThemes’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. HeroThemes will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, HeroThemes discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when HeroThemes believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of HeroThemes, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an HeroThemes website and have supplied your email address, HeroThemes may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with HeroThemes and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. HeroThemes takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. HeroThemes uses cookies to help HeroThemes identify and track visitors, their usage of HeroThemes website, and their website access preferences. HeroThemes visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using HeroThemes’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of HeroThemes’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If HeroThemes, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that HeroThemes goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of HeroThemes may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, HeroThemes may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in HeroThemes’ sole discretion. HeroThemes encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. If you have a HeroThemes account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
