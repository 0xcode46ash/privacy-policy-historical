A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  On this Site, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open.  Once you exit your browser, they disappear.  Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they remain on your hard drive after you exit your browser.  The cookies used on the Site include those which are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies), remember your choices (functionality cookies), and cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising.

We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:

  1. to recognize your computer when you visit the website

  3. to improve the website’s usability
  4. to analyze the use of the website

We also may use “web beacons” on our site.  A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back our service providers’ servers, such as the server of Google Adwords .  These web beacons are the technique by which our service providers compile anonymous information about your browsing activity on the Site.For more information, see the discussion under “Online Tracking” below. 

Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site.

[**Online Tracking**](http://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/page/privacy-notice#Online%20Tracking)

We use third-party web analytics services on our website, such as Google Analytics. These service providers help us analyze how users use our website.

You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Site because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors, such as Google Adwords.  Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests, to track your browser across multiple websites, and to build a profile of your web surfing.  The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.  This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
