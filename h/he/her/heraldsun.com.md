# heraldsun.com: privacy statement

heraldsun.com respects your privacy. 

You should know that we record certain information about each visitor to our site, including, for example, the time of day, specific pages viewed and the type of browser used (i.e., Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer). Almost all websites record this information for every user.

In general, we make no attempt to associate this information with a user's identity. However, we must know a user's identity for certain areas of the site to work properly. For example, if we make an area of our site available only to our print subscribers, then we verify each user's status as a subscriber.

Similarly, in our VoteBook area, the Who Represents Me? and Interactive Sample Ballot features require us to look up a user's voter registration information to determine the political districts he or she lives in. This information is retrieved only on a per-use basis; we do not continue to use this information to track an individual's use of our site. We do not, for example, record whether user John Doe views only Democratic or only Republican candidates' pages.

Certain areas of heraldsun.com are restricted to use by registered users only. We maintain a database of information collected from registered users for several purposes, including direct marketing.

Some of the content on our site is provided directly from web servers owned and operated by third parties, and we do not control, and cannot be held responsible for, their use of any information they may collect.

In the normal course of our business, we supply aggregated usage information (such as the number of monthly page views the site receives) to certain third parties, including current and prospective advertisers. We do not routinely disclose any of our individual user information to third parties. We may disclose this information in special cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of The Durham Herald Company Inc. or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so, or as otherwise provided in the Site's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms.html).

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please write to [webadmin@heraldsun.com](mailto:webadmin@heraldsun.com).
