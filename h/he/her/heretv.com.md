**HERETV.COM'S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

This website is operated by here! Networks, LLC, the owner of the here! programming service. You may contact us directly if you have any questions regarding the content and material on this website, or the collection, use, correction or deletion of any personal or non-personal information provided over this website. 

Our postal address is:

heretv.com collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on heretv.com, for example how many users log into heretv.com on a daily basis). Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to heretv.com, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, in answering surveys, purchasing items from heretv.com or its partners, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by heretv.com. 

Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, heretv.com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from heretv.com, our servers log your IP address. heretv.com does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. heretv.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on heretv.com. 

heretv.com also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow heretv.com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by Heretv.com to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. heretv.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during newsletter registration or a contest), heretv.com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so. 

heretv.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. 

here! may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if here! believes that any user has committed unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, heretv.com may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

In addition, in the event here! plans to post any personal information on the Site, here! will either notify you of this possibility when you provide the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted. 

Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example a contest winner) on the Site. here! will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted. 

**External and/or Third Party Sites**   
It is important to note that heretv.com contains links to sites other than heretv.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as heretv.com. For instance, if you click on a link on heretv.com, this will take you away from heretv.com and to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use heretv.com's logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that heretv.com would not.

**Additional Information**

It may be possible for third parties not under the control of here! to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, here! cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.
