**Reader Surveys and Market Research:** Reader surveys and market research are valuable tools that help us better respond to consumer needs and opinions and help shape our product offerings.

**Online Customer Panels** : We offer readers and customers the opportunity to participate in online research panels. These customers agree to participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by **Herald-Tribune** , their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior.

**Cookies:** Our Web sites employ cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on **HeraldTribune.com, snn6.com, http://sarasota.careercast.com, www.people2people.com, www.udigtv.com** , as well as to track site usage. For detailed information about our use of cookies see our [Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies.](https://web.archive.org/apps/pbcs.dll/misc?URL=/misc/registration/registration_faq.pbs#cookies)

**HeraldTribune.com, snn6.com, http://sarasota.careercast.com, www.people2people.com, www.udigtv.com** use a commercial advertising server (currently **http://adx.heraldtribune.com** ) to display ads on our site. 

In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web sites. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.

We also reserve the right to place a **Herald-Tribune** cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs):** Third party advertisers may also use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind that we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.

**Usage Data:** Our Web sites have currently contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors.

For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to [www.omniture.com/policy.html](http://www.omniture.com/policy.html)

We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.

**IP Addresses:** Our Web sites log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use IP address logs in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site (by domain type, for example), but we do not use IP address logs to track your session or your behavior on our site.

**Mobile Messaging Service:** The New York Times Regional Media Group uses the information collected from your interaction with The New York Times Regional Media Group by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.

The New York Times Regional Media Group collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and The New York Times Regional Media Group. When you send a text message to The New York Times Regional Media Group or via The New York Times Regional Media Group, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. The New York Times Regional Media Group uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.

**Log Files:** Log data is only used in aggregate to analyze usage of our Web sites.

**What do we do with the information we gather/track?**

**Site Login:** Your e-mail address acts as your member login, and together with the password that you create during the registration process your e-mail address allows you to access many of the features and services available on our Web sites.

**HeraldTribune.com, snn6.com, http://sarasota.careercast.com, www.people2people.com, www.udigtv.com** and **Herald-Tribune** will share your e-mail address and password with each other in order to allow you to use the same login and password on each of the **five** sites, whenever possible. This means that you will be able to move back and forth on our Web sites without having to create a new membership account or remember a separate password for each site.

**Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising:** Our Web sites may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. 

In both statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.

**E-Mail Newsletters:** During the registration process, you will have the opportunity to choose to receive periodic e-mails. You may also sign up to receive e-mails at any time by accessing your profile in the Member Center section. We send both editorial e-mail newsletters (news headlines, breaking news alerts, etc.) and e-mail about services offered by **Herald-Tribune** and its partners and advertisers.

**Herald-Tribune** offers direct mail marketing services to its advertisers and employs direct mail marketing for subscription promotions. **Herald-Tribune** may combine Web registration data with newspaper subscriber data and marketing database information we purchase to create lists for targeted postal mail campaigns. Doing so means that you receive offers and advertising that are most likely to interest you, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both your experience and the effectiveness of the mail campaigns. 

Targeted mailing lists may be shared with other departments at **Herald-Tribune** and with marketing staff at **NYTRMG** , of which **Herald-Tribune** is a part and which coordinates mailing efforts for **Herald-Tribune**. We share demographic information about our audience in aggregate form with direct mail advertisers. We never share or sell personally identifiable information or our mailing lists. 

**Programs From Our Partners:** During the registration process, new users who select to register for certain featured offers from our partners will begin receiving e-mail from these companies. You will only receive e-mail messages from these companies if you elect this opt-in service. If you elect to opt-out of an e-mail from a partner, you must do so through that partner directly. The **Herald-Tribune** may use this information as set forth in this privacy policy.

**Other Communications from Herald-Tribune:** **Herald-Tribune** may use the e-mail address provided by you at registration to contact you regarding (1) account status (including confirmation of registration or newspaper subscription); (2) major changes to the Web sites and or to the Member Agreement and Privacy Policy; (3) participation in user surveys, asking for feedback about the Web sites and existing or prospective products and services, as well as information to better understand our users*; and (4) a limited number of messages as specified in the Member Agreement regarding **Herald-Tribune** products and services that may be of interest (including subscriptions, online archives, newsletters and other premium products). You may opt-out at any time from any primarily commercial messages by following the opt-out instructions in the e-mail.

* User surveys greatly help us to improve our Web sites, and any information we obtain in such surveys will not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate form.

**NYTRMG** may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of customers and their buying and purchasing patterns for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our customer base. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom such advertising is the most pertinent. Personal information about you as an individual will not be disclosed without your consent.

From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to receive information and offers about products or services from our advertisers, partners or other third parties. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of all e-mails that are sent by **Herald-Tribune**. If you sign up to receive information directly from an advertiser, partner or third party you may contact that advertiser, partner or third party directly in order to opt-out out of future messages from them.

**Herald-Tribune subscriptions:** **Herald-Tribune** reserves the right to contact you to discuss your account or to renew your subscription, in accordance with applicable laws. We also reserve the right to disclose your opt-out information to third parties so that they can "suppress" your name from future solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws.

If you are a print subscriber to **Herald-Tribune** , or have registered at the **[http://www.HeraldTribune.com/Subscribe](http:://www.HeraldTribune.com/Subscribe)** website, then **Herald-Tribune** may opt to share your e-mail address and other personally identifiable information with a third party service provider that sends e-mail on behalf of the newspaper.
