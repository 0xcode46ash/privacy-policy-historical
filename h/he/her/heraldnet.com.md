## Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy** This site does not collect personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. The occasions of this collection are limited to a visitor using a feedback form, the "E-mail This Story" feature, in submitting a URL for the Web Directory, submitting a classified ad, subscribing to various email lists, digital subscriptions, or subscribing to The Herald printed newspaper. Keyboard input from the user is necessary in all cases.

**What we do with the information** Specific information, such as names and e-mail addresses, provided by users in feedback forms and to e-mail news stories is used internally by The Daily Herald Co. and is never sold nor disclosed to a third party. Any information submitted and posted on the Web site is always at the user's request.

This Web site also collects some involuntary, nonidentifying information about its visitors. We record your IP address - a numeric identification assigned to your computer by your ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as, Earthlink, MSN, or AOL) - to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to help us identify whether you are a unique or repeat user to the site. Your IP address does not personally identify you to us. Only your ISP contains information about you and a record of when the IP address was assigned to your computer.

**Cookies** Cookies are small text files saved onto your computer's hard drive in a special location that is managed by the web browser. Browser security limitations prevent us from storing large amounts of information and the user is under complete control of the temporary cookie files at all times. Refer to your browser's help documentation for more information on how to manage the cookie files. We use the cookie information to remember who you are when you return and to store information that you may have temporarily saved while visiting the Web site. Cookies are useful when it comes to sites that offer some type of customization. Information is saved in the cookie file, so that when you return to the Web site, your customizations remain. We don't store any personally identifiable information in the cookie file -- only information that can be read by our computer system.

Cookies also help us track the number of repeat visitors to the Web site. A log file is generated each day recording the usage of the Web site, and if a specific cookie is present, noting a return visitor.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification or parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

**Special Relationships** The Daily Herald CO. has special relationships with other companies to provide specific content. Many of these sites automatically display the "Herald," "HeraldNet" or "Everett Herald" name at the top of the page.
