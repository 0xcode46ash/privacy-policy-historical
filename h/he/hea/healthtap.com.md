# HealthTap

## Privacy & Security

At HealthTap we believe in the power and benefits of better health information. When patients and physicians come together, we can learn from one and another in engaging ways that are simply not possible when we’re looking for health information alone.

Because online sharing in health is a new concept, you should be comfortable and confident that you can share securely and privately. This is why on HealthTap you can ask health questions and explore health information without also sharing your personal identity. We call this "secure sharing."

How does it work? When you share health information on HealthTap, only you know who you are. Your identity is protected. Our community receives the value of learning from your questions and comments and other information you choose to share, and you benefit from the secure sharing of others in our community. Only unique Public Profile Names are shown.

Our company culture respects the values of secure sharing. Our employees receive privacy training, and we’ve written our [Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/pages/privacy_statement) in easy to read language. We’ve even provided additional suggestions for sharing securely and safeguarding your privacy when participating on HealthTap. Some members will choose to participate on HealthTap under their actual names, but this is always a voluntary choice.

Your Identity is Private

  * Your real name is private (only the Public Profile Name you choose is visible to others)
  * Personally Identifiable Information is not visible to others on the site
  * Our privacy protection standards are certified by TRUSTe



We are Secure

  * We provide Bank-Level Security and encryption
  * Our website is verified secure by VeriSign, and is tested daily
  * Verification is required to reset a password



More on Secure Sharing While Remaining Private

Sharing in a safe and secure setting benefits both you and all community participants by allowing everyone to learn in new ways. You should never be required to give up your privacy when you share, and that’s why member accounts are identified by a Public Profile Name and a Public Profile Image, instead of real names. By properly choosing and safeguarding your unique online HealthTap name, you are anonymous when you share information with our community.

Here are some of the ways we have designed this system with you in mind:

  * Your Public Profile does not contain your real name or other Personally Identifiable Information
  * You can update and delete information in your Account Settings and Health History at any time
  * We automatically log members out of HealthTap after a short period of inactivity



Tips for Sharing While Staying Secure

Here are some tips about how to stay private and share securely:

  * Always keep your password and Public Profile Name private
  * Create a unique Public Profile Name for HealthTap (for example, don’t use the same name on HealthTap that you use on other sites, such as Twitter)
  * Don’t reveal Personally Identifiable Information to other HealthTap members (for example, don’t give a Connection your name or phone number when exchanging Messages, and don’t post Personally Identifiable Information on the site, such as in a question or comment)
  * Don’t leave an active HealthTap session unattended
