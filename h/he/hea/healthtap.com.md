# Privacy and Sharing - HealthTap

## Secure Sharing: HealthTap

On HealthTap you can ask health questions, connect with doctors, get trusted answers and tips, and explore health information without also sharing your personal identity. We call this "secure sharing."

How does it work? On HealthTap, only you know who you are. Your identity is protected. Our community receives the value of learning from your questions and the information you choose to share, and you benefit from the secure sharing of others in our community. You can even personalize your questions without revealing your identity.

Our company culture respects the values of secure sharing. Our employees receive privacy training, and our [Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/terms/privacy_statement) is written in easy to read language. We even provided additional suggestions for sharing securely and safeguarding your privacy when participating on HealthTap.

## Confidential Consultations: HealthTap Prime and Concierge

On HealthTap Prime and Concierge, you can connect with a doctor by video, directly from your computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can ask personal health questions directly to a doctor, and receive care and prescriptions as appropriate for virtual consults. While interactions on HealthTap Prime and HealthTap Concierge are not anonymous (your name and health information are shared with the doctors you consult with), they are secure and confidential.
