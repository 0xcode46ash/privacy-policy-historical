# Public Privacy Statement

Updated: 20 May 2005 

Please contact our Privacy Manager if you require any further information regarding our privacy policy.Â 

The Heart Foundation is Australia's leading heart health charity, saving lives through heart health research, community education programs and services to patients. The Heart Foundation is funded almost entirely by public donations and gifts from people's Wills. 

The Heart Foundation was established in 1959 and since then has played a leading role in decreasing the incidence of death from heart disease by almost 70%. Despite this success, heart disease remains the biggest cause of premature death in Australia today and the Heart Foundation works to help all Australians live longer healthier lives. 

The National Privacy Principles

The Australian Government introduced new legislation that came into force on 21st December 2001 to protect the privacy of individuals. This legislation comprises 10 national Privacy Principles that apply to private sector organisations. You can find out more about these principles by calling the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on 1300 363 992 or through their website at [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/). 

The Heart Foundation respects and upholds your rights to privacy protection under the National Privacy Principles in regulating how we collect, use, disclose and hold your personal information. We have a detailed policy and set of procedures to ensure that only authorised staff have access to your personal information and that it remains confidential and only used for appropriate purposes and in accordance with this policy. 

Why we collect your personal information

Your personal and sensitive information, including health information, is only collected as is necessary for a function or activity to enable the Heart Foundation to carry out its work and deliver services to the community. 

The Heart Foundation is very grateful to the many thousands of people around Australia who provide financial support to allow us to continue our important lifesaving work. When you give us personal information such as your name and address, we record it on our database and use it to contact you. 

We may use your personal information to send you information on heart disease or to let you know about our special events and fundraising programs. Each time that we send you a direct marketing communication we will provide you with a simple way to OPT OUT of receiving similar communications in the future. 

You can also let us know that you do not wish to receive any further mail by phoning Heartline on 1300 36 27 87 for the cost of a local call. 

Occasionally the Heart Foundation may allow third parties to mail you with information that we believe may be of interest to you. These organisations usually allow us to do the same and this way we can reach more people with vital information. However whenever we contact you, we will always give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such offers. We also do not give these organisations your details. Instead these mailings are arranged through an independent party, which is strictly compliant with privacy legislation. However if you do take advantage of any offer from a third party organisation, they may send further offers to you directly. 

The Heart Foundation will not collect sensitive information about health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade association or union membership, sexual preferences or criminal record, unless you have consented to give this information and it is relevant to the work of the Heart Foundation. We will always collect such information in a non-intrusive, lawful and fair manner. 

Opting out of modifying your information

If you want to change any information that you have previously given us, or if you want to opt out of future communications please contact: 

The Privacy Officer   
Heart Foundation   
GPO Box 9966   
In your Capital City 

Alternatively, please call: 1300 55 02 82 or email: [inform@heartfoundation.com.au](mailto:inform@heartfoundation.com.au)

How we collect your personal information 

We collect your personal information when you provide it to the Heart Foundation in a number of ways including: 

  * through a call to Heartline, our health information service 
  * by participating in one of the Heart Foundation's many community fundraising and information events 
  * when you respond to our fundraising mail. 



We may also collect your personal information from publicly available sources such as the telephone directory. 

How we keep your personal information secure

If you provide us with your personal information, it is securely stored in our database, which is accessed only by authorised staff at the Heart Foundation. Our computer system is kept secure by our internal network using Windows NT Domain authentication. Each user has security level access and must provide a username/password to gain access. In addition, our external access to e-mail and the Internet is protected by a Firewall/Router. 

Disclosing your personal information

The Heart Foundation will not provide your personal information to any other individuals or organisations except on a confidential basis to contractors who provide database management, printing and mailing services to the Heart Foundation. In these cases, we ensure that our contractors are also bound by the National Privacy Principles to keep your personal information confidential. 

Occasionally the Heart Foundation may allow third parties to mail you with information that we believe may be of interest to you. These organisations usually allow us to do the same and this way we can reach more people with vital information. However whenever we contact you, we will always give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such offers. We also do not give these organisations your details. Instead these mailings are arranged through an independent party, which is strictly compliant with privacy legislation. However if you do take advantage of any offer from a third party organisation, they may send further offers to you directly. 

The Heart Foundation is very thankful to people who are willing to share their personal stories of heart disease with others through media stories and in our Heartnews newsletter. We will only use your personal information for publicity purposes or as stories in Heartnews with your express written permission. 

The Heart Foundation will not provide your personal information to any overseas organisation without first asking your permission. In such a case, we will also ensure that such organisations are bound by privacy laws at least as strict as those in Australia.
