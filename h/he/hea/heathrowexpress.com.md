# Privacy Notice

**Updated May 2018**

**Privacy Notice  
**  
This privacy notice tells you what to expect when Heathrow Express Ltd (a subsidiary of Heathrow Airport Ltd) collects personal information from you via our websites, our mobile app, ticket transactions, station surveillance cameras, customer relations team, and on-board Wi-Fi service. Heathrow Express is committed to protecting your personal information when you use Heathrow Express services. Whenever you provide such information we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all applicable laws concerning the protection of personal data including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**What justification do we have for asking for the information?** Where you buy a ticket from us the lawful justification for collecting and using your personal data is that it is necessary for the performance of the Heathrow Express train services which you contractually enter into.

Where your information is provided to third parties they will only use your information for those purposes listed below.   
In some minimal instances, this may require your information to be transferred overseas, but we will make sure your information remains protected and secure and in line with your rights.
