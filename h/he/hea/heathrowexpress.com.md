# Privacy - Heathrow Express - Heathrow Express

Your privacy is important to us.

We use the personal data you give us to process your travel booking and to send you confirmation of your travel booking by e-mail or sms text message. 

We may also use the information you give us as a research tool to develop the content of the Heathrow Express or BAA plc websites, to develop our understanding of our visitors and to determine how best to serve them.

We may use selected and appropriately secured third parties to assist us with this research as well as ongoing marketing. 

We will not send your data to any additional third parties, unless you agree to us doing so or we are compelled by law, and we will not send data to areas where an adequate data protection policy is not in place.

The website collects some anonymous information about you automatically as you move through the site. This information is used to help us monitor how you and other visitors use the site, allowing us to provide an improved service throughout the site. The information collected automatically does not, however, contain anything that can identify you personally.
