The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: Healthcentral.com. 

**IP Addresses**  
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Healthcentral.com collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from Healthcentral.com, the Healthcentral.com servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, Healthcentral.com does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. However, Healthcentral.com will use IP addresses to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with Healthcentral.com's in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others.

Our site places a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.
