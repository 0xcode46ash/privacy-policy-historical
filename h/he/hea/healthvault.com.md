It does not apply to data collected through the Microsoft HealthVault Account, other programs that work with the HealthVault Account, or other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. This is a preliminary disclosure and may not be exhaustive.

We will ask you when and if we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. 

We may collect information about your interaction with the Site. For example, we may use web site analytics tools on the Site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find the Site, the pages you view within the Site, and your browser's width and height. We also may use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Site. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses.

### Use of your information

Microsoft collects and uses your information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as web site hosting; packaging, mailing and delivering prizes; answering customer questions about products and services; and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. If we provide personal information to such companies, we only provide the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  1. conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; 
  2. protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of web sites; 
  3. act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft products or members of the public.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually [modify your browser setting](http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm) to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies.

We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Microsoft may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We prohibit web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.
