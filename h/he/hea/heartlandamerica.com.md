Customer submitting content further grants Heartland a non-exclusive, perpetual and worldwide royalty free license for the use of such content in any and all media as Heartland sees fit. Customers submitting content further agree and understand that Heartland must exercise an appropriate amount of control over such content, and must make decisions about which content to post, and in which venues. This means that not all content will be posted, and customer shall have no recourse or say regarding whether any particular content is posted or used in any form. 

Content that is considered off topic will be deemed inappropriate and will not be posted.
