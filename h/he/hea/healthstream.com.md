HealthStream, Inc. has established the following Privacy Policy to clearly identify the standards of privacy we observe in managing the information you provide to us. We recognize that our collection, use and protection of information about you must be clearly defined and limited at all times and that all due care must be taken to avoid any improper or unintentional distribution of or access to your information. This Policy describes the information we collect, how we use that information, how we protect that information and your rights with respect to this Policy. Throughout this policy we will use the collective “you” to refer to visitors to our website. By submitting information on our website(s) and/or using our products and services, you agree to this Policy.

The Information HealthStream Collects  
In general, you may visit our website without providing us with any personal information. However, we may collect information from you in several ways, including but not limited to, the following:

  * You may choose to complete certain response forms to register for an event or to request additional investor or product information. Through these response forms you may be asked or required to submit your name, email address, phone number, title, employer and address. 
  * You may provide additional information by participating in optional online forums and surveys presented by HealthStream on our own behalf or on behalf of a healthcare system, pharmaceutical or medical device company or other organization. 



How HealthStream Uses Collected Information  
We use the information we collect to respond to your requests for information, to manage events and to analyze use of our website. In using the information we collect, we abide by the following principles:

  * We do not authorize any person or organization to use your individually identifiable contact information for their own marketing purposes. 
  * We require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information we or they collect from you. 
  * We do not sell or provide individually identifiable activity or performance information to any person or organization for any purpose. 



We may also use your individually identifiable information, including contact information, in other ways with your consent including providing you with unrequested information and offers via email, phone or physical mail.

How HealthStream Protects Collected Information  
HealthStream uses appropriate safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the information we have collected. We focus on two primary types of safeguards: online or network safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of information as it is transmitted, or potentially accessed, over the Internet or other networks; and offline or physical safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of information as it resides on our computer hardware.

**Network Safeguards.** To protect the security, integrity and privacy of information transmitted between the user’s browser and our servers, we use the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology scrambles data in transmission so that the information is nearly impossible to read it or use. Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. In addition, individuals may engage in criminal behavior by attempting to gain access via the Internet or other networks to our computer systems containing information not belonging to them. 

**Physical Safeguards.** Our services are provided from third-party hosting facilities. All collected information is maintained in these facilities. Visitors are only provided access to these facilities following pre-clearance, identification and sign in/sign out procedures, and biometric scanning. The facilities are hardened to withstand natural disasters. A complete set of alternate systems is provided throughout, including the emergency generators which have their own back-up power supply. Another level of protection provided by HealthStream’s external hosting facilities is limited exposure to virus-prone communications, such as e-mail. HealthStream employs industry-standard software to provide constant monitoring and virus scanning.

How You May Access and Correct Collected Information  
You have a right to know about the individually identifiable information that HealthStream has collected as described above, including the right to access, correct or delete the information that HealthStream has on file if it is incorrect. If you suspect the information HealthStream has in its records is incorrect, you may make a request to correct the information directly to HealthStream through the contact set forth below.

How We Notify You of Changes to this Policy  
HealthStream may modify this Policy at any time, at its discretion, and modifications are effective upon being posted on HealthStream’s various websites. You are responsible for reviewing this policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it.
