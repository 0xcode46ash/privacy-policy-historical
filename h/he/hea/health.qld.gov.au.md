# Queensland Health Privacy and Confidentiality Statement

Queensland Health is committed to protecting user privacy. We understand and appreciate that visitors and users of this web site are concerned about their privacy and the confidentiality and security of any information that may be provided to us. 

To protect your privacy Queensland Health staff follow 9 privacy principles.  The principles deal with how we collect and handle your personal information.  They are set out in the _[ Information Privacy Act 2009](http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/I/InfoPrivA09.pdf)._

### How is this website monitored?

When you look at this web site, our internet service and analytics providers make a record of your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes only:
