# Queensland Health Privacy and Confidentiality Statement

Queensland Health is committed to protecting user privacy. We understand and appreciate that visitors and users of this web site are concerned about their privacy and the confidentiality and security of any information that may be provided to us. 

To protect your privacy Queensland Health staff follow 10 privacy principles. The principles deal with how we collect and handle your personal information. They are set out in a Queensland Government [information standard](http://www.iie.qld.gov.au/site/informationstandards/current.asp) (IS42A Information Privacy for the Queensland Department of Health).

### How is this website monitored?

When you look at this web site, our Internet Service Provider makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes only -

the user's server address

### Taking Part in Queensland Health Surveys

At times you may be asked if you wish to complete survey questionnaires that appear on our site; for example, on topical public health issues such as smoking. Taking part in these surveys is entirely voluntary, and many surveys are able to be completed anonymously.

If you do agree to participate in a survey, you will be asked to review and accept certain additional terms and conditions relating to the use of any personal information you provide. This does NOT include identifiable information. 

### E-mail and Feedback Information

This is a Queensland Government website. E-mail correspondence sent to this site will be treated as a public record and will be retained as required by the _Public Records Act 2002_ and other relevant regulations. 

Your name and address details will not be added to a mailing list, nor will we disclose these details to third parties without your consent unless required by law. E-mail messages may however be monitored by our website support staff for system trouble shooting and maintenance purposes. 

Although every effort will be made, Queensland Health does not guarantee to reply to e-mail correspondence. Where appropriate, e-mails sent to this site may be forwarded internally to other Queensland Health officers for direct response. 

### How do I go about obtaining access to information held about me by Queensland Health?

Queensland Health supports your right to see what personal information, including health information, is held about you.

Access to your health information is usually provided simply through our Administrative Access to Health Records Policy. Requests for access to your health records must be in writing and should be directed to the office of the medical superintendent of the public hospital you have attended, or the manager of the community health service you have attended. Documentary evidence of identity should also be supplied with your request (for example, a certified copy of a driver’s licence or birth certificate). A [contact list of Queensland Health hospitals and facilities](https://web.archive.org/hospitals/facility_list.asp) is available on our website.

You also have the right to request access to information about you under Freedom of Information. If there is something in the information that is incorrect, or which you do not agree with, you can request that it be amended. 

If you wish to make a freedom of information application you should send your application to the delegated decision-maker for the health service district where you have been treated. A list of [decision-makers](https://web.archive.org/publications/corporate/st_affairs03/appendix3.pdf) with their contact details is available on our website. 

The Legal and Administrative Law Unit for Queensland Health is also available to provide advice to people seeking assistance in making applications. Phone queries should be directed to (07) 3234 1735, or the Unit can be contacted via email at: [FOI@health.qld.gov.au](mailto:FOI@health.qld.gov.au)

Further information on freedom of information can be found in our [Statement of Affairs](https://web.archive.org/publications/corporate/st_affairs03/default.asp), or [Privacy Plan](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy_plan.asp).
