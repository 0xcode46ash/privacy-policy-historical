All Service Providers in our network have entered into agreements with us that require them to secure any personal information provided through the site and limit how they can use such information.

If one of the Service Providers contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that Service Provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Service Provider. Please note that the Service Providers may maintain the information you provided whether or not you elect to use their services.

#### Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information

We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect with third parties, including our affiliates, to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our site and on the websites of third parties and our affiliates.

This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide on the site.

If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy.

## Information Collection Technologies

To better serve our users and Service Providers and increase the response time of the site, we use various technologies to collect information about our users, such as:

_Cookies._ Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used the site. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. We also may use cookies to deliver targeted advertising (or allow third parties to deliver targeted advertising) on our website and the websites of our affiliates and third parties.

_Log Files._ We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

_Clear Gifs._ We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site and in our HTML emails by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

This Website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect any personal information from visitors under the age of 13 online through this Website. If you think that we have collected personal information from a visitor under the age of 13, please contact us.

The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By visiting our site or using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, regardless of the laws of your residence country.

#### **Who Are We:**

We’re an independent, privately-operated provider of consumer healthcare information, operating since 2006. We’re different than [HealthCare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/), which is a government website launched in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and have been in business far longer as a website and company. From HealthCare.com, you can shop around for healthcare marketplace plans (i.e., the same plans available on HealthCare.gov), and other state-based exchanges. In addition, we may display plans that are sold by insurance carriers that meet federal standards to be a qualified health plan ( as defined by the ACA), but are not sold at HealthCare.gov or your state exchange. We do not actually sell health plans ourselves, but work with licensed entities. 

####  **What if I Need a Subsidy?**

Our website helps you calculate if you are eligible for a subsidy. We provide only an estimate. You can apply for and buy a plan online at HealthCare.gov (or a state exchange website), through a web-based entity as defined by the ACA, or from licensed insurance agents. We partner with both web-based entities and licensed insurance agents to enroll consumers. You officially calculate and apply for a subsidy at the time of purchase. If you are eligible for a subsidy, you can apply for qualified health plan (as defined by the ACA) through insurance carriers and certified, licensed insurance agents that partner with us.

Here are important facts straight from HealthCare.gov confirming that health insurance can be (and most-often is) purchased outside of the federal exchange website:

> “Many insurance agents and brokers can also help you apply for and enroll in Marketplace health coverage. Contact an agent or broker to learn more.” 

> “You can also get insurance outside the Marketplace--through a private insurance company, an online insurance seller, or an agent or broker.” 

####  **Our Business Model:**

Our business model is to: 1) aggregate a comprehensive set of plan options – including both on-exchange and off-exchange plans – from public and private sources, 2) develop industry-leading tools, data and technology to help consumers select a plan, and 3) match consumers with multiple purchase options – online, over the phone or directly with a certified, licensed insurance agent. We generate revenue from agencies and carriers by facilitating plan purchases. We also generate some targeted advertising revenue from the website. Our services are free to consumers.
