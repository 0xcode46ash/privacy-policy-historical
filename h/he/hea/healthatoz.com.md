**Information Provided at Registration**

HealthAtoZ pledges to protect the privacy of all of our registered users. The HealthAtoZ registration form requires users to give us contact information (name and e-mail address), and demographic information (ZIP code or age). To use some site functions users must volunteer personal health information (such as, height, weight, and past medical history). There is no financial information collected.

We use contact information from the registration form for internal purposes, to send the user news, information about new HealthAtoZ site features, services or updates, information about our company, and promotional material or offers from some of our corporate partners. You will be given the opportunity to decline these services at the point of registration, and you may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/Opt-out section following).

Demographic and personal health information is used to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Your health information is password-protected to prevent access by other users.

HealthAtoZ will not sell or forward to third parties any individually identifiable personal information, e.g., your e-mail address, name, etc., that you supply during the registration process; this includes health insurers. You can be assured that our content providers will not have access to your personal information. HealthAtoZ may, however, provide your personal health information and that of other registered users in aggregate form to third parties, but never in such a way that it violates your privacy. This means that we will never provide anyone's individual health records to any third party, although we may provide advertisers with information about the prevalence of certain health conditions in the overall group of HealthAtoZ subscribers, and similar aggregate information.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

HealthAtoZ does not knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 13. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children, and this website is not designed or intended for children under the age of 13.

All personal, identifiable information is retained by Medical Network, Inc. (d.b.a. HealthAtoZ.com) for a period of 5 years/indefinitely unless a member requests that the information be deleted. If you would like your information deleted, please contact HealthAtoZ and provide us with your user name and the e-mail address you provided us with at:

As an alternative to taking the HRA, users can choose to select their topics of interest.

**Online Surveys**

We may run surveys on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our company. You have the option of choosing not to receive such e-mails at the time you register or at any time. (See Choice/Opt-Out section following.) 

**HealthAtoZ E-Health Dashboard, Health Managers and Personal Health Record**

As part of registration for the HealthAtoZ E-Health Dashboard, Health Managers and Personal Health Record you will be requested to provide contact information, demographic information, and personal health information and to take an online Health Risk Appraisal to enable you to use these programs fully. Please see the HealthAtoZ Terms of Service for more details on the type of information gathered, how it is used, and how your privacy is protected. 

Users may opt to select their health topics of interest manually rather than complete the Health Risk Appraisal.
