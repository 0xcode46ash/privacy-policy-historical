**a. General.** Sickbay Health Media recognizes the premium you place on privacy protection on the Internet. Our employees share the same concerns! Working together, we strive to protect your privacy, including the non-identifying information you share in the personal profile that you must complete in order to become a participating member ("Member") within the Interactive Areas of this Site. 

Sickbay Health Media does not collect personally identifiable information about Members or other Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com users ("Users") except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. A Member's or User's access to and use of the Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com Sites or services constitutes information voluntarily given by the Member or User.

**b. Use of Registration Information.** Personally identifiable information of individual Members and Users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the Member's or User's prior consent. Sickbay Health Media stores the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer when you visit our site. This information is only used to create broad demographic summaries of where our Members and Users come from: for example, we know what percentage of Members or Users come from Asia or South America, but our use of the IP addresses does not include identifying who those users actually are. However, Sickbay Health Media may use registration information and other voluntarily submitted information in the following ways:  


    * To provide our editors with information that is useful in developing new features and services for Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com Members and Users;
    * To provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our Member base and User usage patterns; and
    * To allow us to potentially vary advertising based on Member and User preference. 



  
Sickbay Health Media reserves the right to perform statistical analyses and profiling of Member and User behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information. Sickbay Health Media will provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties; no personally identifiable information will be disclosed. Sickbay Health Media may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com. In this event, Sickbay.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and Members and Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party before providing personally identifiable information. 

It is not possible for a Member or User to delete his or her profile from our database, nor is it feasible to delete all traces of a Member's or User's activity in the system. Messages posted to the boards are examples of user activities that are not feasible to delete. However, we do offer you the opportunity to request deletion of your email address-the only individually identifiable piece of information about your account - from Sickbay Health Media's database.

Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, and Netsweat.com send regular email updates to Members. If you wish to have your email address deleted from our database, follow the directions included at the bottom of the email you received. Please allow two to three business days for the actual cancellation to take effect. We will not share your email address with third parties without first receiving your permission. 

**c. Voluntary Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information on Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms, and other Interactive Areas** (collectively referred to as "Interactive Areas"). Members and Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (for example, user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or chat areas of Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the Member's or User's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Sickbay Health Media. Sickbay Health Media makes no warranties about the discoverability of members' identity by methods beyond our control.
