VDL, Inc., as a Data Controller, is bound by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

We may collect the following information:  
Information You Voluntarily Submit to the Website: We may collect personal information from you such as your name or email address. For example, you may voluntarily submit information to the Website by subscribing to a newsletter, or submitting a contact form.

Automatically-Collected Information: We automatically collect certain information about you and the device with which you access the Website. For example, when you use the Website, we will log your IP address, operating system type, browser type, referring website, pages you viewed, and the dates/times when you accessed the Website. We may also collect information about actions you take when using the Website, such as links clicked.

Cookies: We may log information using cookies, which are small data files stored on your browser by the Website. We may use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until deleted, to provide you with a more personalized experience on the Website. For more information visit www.allaboutcookies.org. You can set your browser not to accept cookies and the above website tells you how to remove cookies from your browser.

You agree that we are entitled to obtain, use and process the information you provide to us to enable us to discharge the Services, including contacting you via email and analysis for website improvement purposes.

 **Analytics**  
We use Google Analytics to store information about how visitors use our website so that we may make improvements and give visitors a better user experience.

Google Analytics is a third-party information storage system that records information about the pages you visit, the length of time you were on specific pages and the website in general, how you arrived at the site and what you clicked on when you were there. These cookies do not store any personal information about you eg name, address etc and we do not share the data. You can view their privacy policy [here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/). You may opt out of the Google Analytics via the [Google Analytics’ opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

 **Jetpack**  
Jetpack is a tool that has several functionalities, but we only use it to collect non-personal statistics about visits to our website, similarly to Google Analytics. Jetpack is owned and operated by Automattic – here’s their [privacy notice](https://automattic.com/privacy-notice/) and [privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).

Automattic has provided us with the following privacy information:

Data Used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Important: The site owner does not have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by Automattic for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature.

Activity Tracked: Post and page views, video plays (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature to honor DNT settings of visitors. By default, DNT is currently not honored.

 **iThemes Sync and iThemes Security**  
This web site uses a third party service to manage administrative tasks. If you leave a comment, submit personal information via a contact form, or otherwise exchange personal details with us, it is possible that we may use this service to manage that data. Please visit the [iThemes Privacy Policy ](https://ithemes.com/privacy-policy/)for more information regarding the way they handle their data.

The IP address of visitors, user ID of logged in users, and username of login attempts are conditionally logged to check for malicious activity and to protect this site from specific kinds of attacks. Examples of conditions when logging occurs include login attempts, log out requests, requests for suspicious URLs, changes to site content, and password updates. This information is retained for 14 days.

This site is scanned for potential malware and vulnerabilities by Sucuri’s SiteCheck. We do not send personal information to Sucuri; however, Sucuri could find personal information posted publicly (such as in comments) during their scan. For more details, please see [Sucuri’s privacy policy](https://sucuri.net/privacy). Security logs are retained for 14 days.

This site is part of a network of sites that protect against distributed brute force attacks. To enable this protection, the IP address of visitors attempting to log into the site is shared with a service provided by ithemes.com. For privacy policy details, please see the [iThemes Privacy Policy](https://ithemes.com/privacy-policy/).

We use this service, among other things, to enable user ratings of our recipes. Recipe Maker has provided us with the following information:

Cookies  
When user ratings are enabled we store a WPRM_User_Voted_%recipe% cookie (with %recipe% the ID of the recipe) that contains the rating this user has given to a particular recipe. This cookie is used as (one of the) measures to prevent rating spam.

When user ratings are enabled we store the IP address upon voting. This is used as (one of the) measures to prevent rating spam.

 **Advertising**  
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the website. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.

In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith.

 **AdThrive Advertising**  
This Site is affiliated with AdThrive, LLC (“AdThrive”) for the purposes of placing advertising on the Site. AdThrive uses standard and widely-available tools for the placement and serving of ads, including those provided by Google, Inc. and its affiliates. We publish interest-based advertisements on the Site; that is, ads that are tailored to reflect your interests. To help understand your interests, AdThrive, Google and our other advertising partners will track your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the Internet using cookies.

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

By using this Site, you consent to the use of such cookies and the sharing of data captured by such cookies with AdThrive, Google, and our other third party partners. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser by visiting: [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/). You can also opt out of the network cookie using those settings or using the Network Advertising Initiative’s multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: [http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/). However, these opt-out mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be maintained.

For European Economic Area Residents: If you reside in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), then under the GDPR and applicable data protection laws you have the rights, among other things, to access your personal data, have us erase it, and/or restrict its further processing. If you wish to access or delete your personal data (if any) maintained by us or AdThrive related to advertising on the Site, you can contact AdThrive at info@adthrive.com. If you wish to see a list of the advertising partners we work with or change which of those partners track your behavior using cookies, click the ad preferences icon. (Available in the EU.)

 **IP addresses**  
An IP or Internet Protocol Address is a unique numerical address assigned to a computer as it logs on to the internet. VDL, Inc. does not have access to any personal identifiable information and we would never seek this information. Your IP address is logged when visiting our site, but our analytic software only uses this information to track how many visitors we have from particular regions, and Recipe Maker as detailed above uses it to prevent rating spam.

 **How will we use the information about you and why?**  
At VDL, Inc. we take your privacy seriously and will only use your personal information to provide the Services you have requested from us. We will only use this information subject to your instructions, data protection law and our duty of confidentiality.

Our lawful reason for processing your personal information is “A legitimate interest” eg to respond to your request to receive emails from us. We collect information on our website to process your enquiry and send you emails and newsletters. We will not share your information for marketing purposes with other companies so that they may offer you their own products and services.

We may use the information collected in the following ways:  
To operate and maintain the Website;  
To send you promotional information, such as newsletters. Each email promotion will provide information on how to opt-out of future mailings;  
To send you administrative communications, such as administrative emails, confirmation emails, technical notices, updates on policies, or security alerts;  
To respond to your inquiries;  
To track and measure advertising on the Website;  
To protect, investigate, and deter against unauthorized or illegal activity.

Except when required by law, we will not sell, distribute, or reveal your email addresses or other personal information without your consent; however, we may disclose or transfer personal information collected through the Website to third parties who acquire all or a portion of our business, which may be the result of a merger, consolidation, or purchase of all or a portion of our assets.

From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you, or data combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or information collected from cookies.

You may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Website to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user.

 **Transferring your information outside of Europe**  
As part of the services offered to you through this website, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (“EU”). We and some of our third-party providers are located outside of the EU. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU to give you those services.

 **Security precautions in place about data collected**  
When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely. Our website is encrypted and protected with the following software: DV SSLs from Let’s Encrypt. When you are on a secure page, a lock icon will typically appear on web browsers.

Non-sensitive details such as your email address are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

 **Marketing**  
We will send you information about new blog posts, or other emails and newsletters which may be of interest to you. If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at any point as set out below. You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. To opt out please email: HealthyRecipesBlog@gmail.com, or use the “Unsubscribe” link on any email you receive from us.

 **How long will we hold your data for?**  
GDPR requires us to retain personal data no longer than is necessary for the purpose we obtained it for.

We will hold your personal data that you voluntarily gave to us, eg name and email for marketing purposes, for as long as you wish to continue receiving emails from us. With each email you receive from us, you will have the opportunity to opt out by unsubscribing.

As for information collected by Google Analytics, we have set our user data retention period to the shortest offered, 14 months.

 **Access to your information**  
You can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. Please email HealthyRecipesBlog@gmail.com.
