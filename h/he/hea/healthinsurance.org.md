# Special report: healthinsurance.org’s privacy policy

This privacy policy discloses the information privacy practices for the Web site you are currently visiting. You may contact healthinsurance.org™ [via e-mail through this form](http://www.healthinsurance.org/contact/) or via postal mail at healthinsurance.org™ LLC, 860 Blue Gentian Road Suite 330, Eagan, MN 55121.

## Your privacy and insurance quotes

We link to sites which provide individual health insurance quotes. The product, your ZIP code and availablity in your area determine which options we display. We choose partners using several criteria, most importantly your convenience and privacy:

  * no hassle: shop online, no agent will call
  * comparison shopping: side-by-side pricing/plans from multiple providers
  * mimimum personal information: in most cases just your zip code, birth date and gender



In many cases these quotes are furnished by [eHealth](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/ehi/Alliance?allid=pou14050), the leading provider of health insurance quotes on the Internet. When you see these quotes in your Web browser they are clearly indicated by the logos on the top of the listings pages.

In some ZIP codes, where no online individual health insurance quote is available, we may instead show you sponsored listings.

## Sponsored listings

For several other products, including Medicare, entering your ZIP code in our form will present you with a page of sponsored listings. Here is an [example of sponsored listings](http://www.healthinsurance.org/quotes/?prodid=210&ad_type=3&zip=55044&source=homepage&-v=3). Healthinsurance.org uses an outside service, [BrokersWeb](https://www.brokersweb.com/),  to manage these sponsored listings. Each sponsored site has its own privacy policy – be a wise consumer and be aware that providing your contact information to these sites give them permission to call or e-mail you. If you see these ads elsewhere on the site they will be identified with a title including the words “Sponsored listings” above them.

## Health insurance quotes by phone

Calling the toll free numbers of 1-866-573-8466 or, on mobile 1-800-541-4670, will connect you with a licensed health insurance agent working for [InsureMe.com](http://www.insureme.com/).

## Your personal information

healthinsurance.org™ only collects personal information from you in these instances:

  * if you use [this form](http://www.healthinsurance.org/contact/) to contact us, we only use your information to reply and do not share it
  * in select ZIP codes a pilot project connects you with an insurance agent in your area. This is considered a “unique lead” meaning you will be called by one — and only one — licensed insurance agent. This typically affects less than one half of one percent of our visitors a week.



In the case of the pilot project, you may be contacted by healthinsurance.org™ in a followup survey to determine your satisfaction with this process.

## Anonymous information

Statistic services, including Google Analytics, log how visitors interact with healthinsurance.org, which helps us improve our site. They do not personally identify you.

We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, and customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

## Social sharing tools

healthinsurance.org™ offers tools from third parties, including but not limited to Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, to help you share content to your social networks or comment on stories on our site. You opt-in to these services through those sites — they are offered merely as a convenience here.

When you click on a link that takes you away from healthinsurance.org, be a smart consumer and review the privacy practices at any site you navigate to before providing personal information.

Many other such links are found on our [state guides](https://web.archive.org/states/) and on other articles throughout the site.
