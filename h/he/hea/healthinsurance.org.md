# Privacy Policy for the Health Insurance Resource Center

This Privacy Policy discloses the information privacy practices for the Web site you are currently visiting. You may be accessing this site through a secure server at linus.pounce.com -- this is a server registered to our Web site management company, pounce.com. You may contact healthinsurance.org or our management company via e-mail [through this form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051211104132id_/http%3A//www.healthinsurance.org/contact.lasso) or via postal mail at healthinsurance.org. c/o pounce.com, 19350 Ireland Court, Lakeville, MN 55044.

Throughout the policy, we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, e-mail address as "personal information." Further, personal information includes any information involving your health or medical history.

**Disclosure of your personal information**

We do not disclose, sell, trade or give away your personal information to anyone, except as needed to provide you with a health insurance quote in the specific instances shown here:

  * **H** **ealth insurance company.** We provide personal information directly to one or more health insurance carriers that offer quotes to persons living in your state. They are allowed to use this information solely to provide you with the health insurance quote you are requesting; and they are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.

  * **Non-profit associations.** In those ZIP areas where have an agreement with a non-profit association in your state which provides access to health insurance as one of its benefits (an example of this type of association is [Communicating for Agriculture & The Self-Employed](http://www.selfemployedcountry.org/)), we will forward your contact information to them for the purpose of having their licensed enrollers provide you with a quote on your health insurance. They are allowed to use this information solely to provide you with the health insurance quote you are requesting, and they are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality.




Outside of these two exceptions, we will not share your personal information with third parties.

**Use of your contact information**

The use of your contact information is restricted to the following:

  * **In regards to your quote.** The insurance company or non-profit association in part one may use your personal information to get in touch with you when necessary to provide you with a quote or to process your application should you choose to be insured by them . For example, the company or association may e-mail, call or mail you to provide you with a quote or to seek additional information that is needed to provide you with a quote.

  * **Visitor satisfaction or other products.** As of the last update of this privacy policy on April 26, 2005, healthinsurance.org _**has never sent an e-mail to a visitor other than in direct response to a question submitted though our contact form,**_ and at this time has no plans to do so.

However, as of July 15, 2002 we added a question at the end of our quote-request form allowing visitors to opt-out of any future mailings, _should they occur._

In the unlikely event we were to contact you, if would be to survey your satisfaction of our service and/or to inform you of additional products and services. In addition, if any such e-mails are sent the sender would clearly be identified as "healthinsurance.org" and you would be directed to a Web page on the healthinsurance.org site to access any information or offers described. Also see information below on "opting out."

You may be included in that number, but are never personally identified. We may share information such as the number of visitors to our Web site from a particular state with partners, but never their names and contact information (except to provide you a quote as disclosed above).
