# healthinsurance.org’s privacy policy

This privacy policy discloses the information privacy practices for the Web site you are currently visiting. You may contact healthinsurance.org [via e-mail through this form](http://www.healthinsurance.org/contact/) or via postal mail at healthinsurance.org, 5353 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 300, St. Louis Park, MN 55416.

### Your privacy and insurance quotes

We link to sites which provide individual health insurance quotes. The product, your ZIP code and availablity in your area determine which options we display. We choose partners using several criteria, most importantly your convenience and privacy:

  * no hassle: shop online, no agent will call
  * comparison shopping: side-by-side pricing/plans from multiple providers
  * mimimum personal information: in most cases, not even your name or contact information



In some ZIP codes, where no online individual health insurance quote is available, we may instead show you sponsored listings.

### Sponsored listings

For several other products, entering your ZIP code in our form will present you with a page of sponsored listings. These sites are advertisers and are not owned or managed by healthinsurance.org.

### Anonymous information

Statistic services, including Google Analytics, log how visitors interact with healthinsurance.org, which helps us improve our site. They do not personally identify you.

### Cookies

A “cookie” is a piece of information that our web site sends to your browser, which then is stored on your system. You may disable or delete cookies at any moment. We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, and customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site.

### Social sharing tools

healthinsurance.org offers tools from third parties, including but not limited to Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, to help you share content to your social networks or comment on stories on our site. You opt-in to these services through those sites — they are offered merely as a convenience here.

### Links to other web sites

When you click on a link that takes you away from healthinsurance.org, be a smart consumer and review the privacy practices at any site you navigate to before providing personal information. Our “[Other Resources](https://web.archive.org/more-resources/)”  is an entire, curated section of other Web sites our editors have determined may be helpful to consumers. Many other such links are found on our [state guides](https://web.archive.org/states/) and on other articles throughout the site.
