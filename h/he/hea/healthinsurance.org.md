# Privacy Policy for the Health Insurance Resource Center

This Privacy Policy discloses the information privacy practices for the Web site you are currently visiting. You may contact healthinsurance.org via e-mail [through this form](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205081922id_/http%3A//www.healthinsurance.org/writeus.lasso) or via postal mail at healthinsurance.org, 19350 Ireland Court, Lakeville, MN 55044.

**No disclosure of your personal information**

The only time healthinsurance.org collects any personal information from you is if you use our contact form to write to use. We only use your e-mail or other information to reply to your message and do not keep it on file or share it with any other company.

**Your privacy and health insurance quotes**

As part of our services, we provide a means to get free quotes on health insurance products. These quotes are supplied by the Internet's leading insurance quote service, **[ehealthinsurance](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/ehi/Alliance?sid=default&type=IFP&allid=pou14050)** and when you request a health insurance quote you are taken to its Web site. We chose them for several reasons, **most importantly your privacy:**

  * immediate access to pricing and policy details online -- **no agent will call,** but they have qualified agents for you to talk to should you choose;
  * the large offering of policies from a variety of insurance companies makes it easy for consumers to **shop and compare;**
  * you can get quotes with only basic information, ZIP code and genders and ages of proposed insured. **You do not need to give a name, e-mail or other identifiable information** unless you decide to apply for a policy.



Please refer to **ehealthinsurance's[privacy policy](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/ehealthinsurance/PrivacyPolicy/CobrandPrivacyPolicyPopup.html)** on its site to see how they handle your personal information once your provide it.

**Your privacy and dental plan quotes**

On April 21, 2006, we began a test program with dentalplans.com to offer a quoting service for dental discount programs, and when you request a dental plan quote you are taken to its Web site. These are not insurance -- they are prenegotiated discount programs that dentists can elect to participate in. They are much lower cost than insurance programs but are not insurance -- we urge you to read about these programs at dentalplans.com.

We chose this vendor for the same reasons we chose our health quote vendor -- to give you access to the widest variety of products with complete pricing and benefit information without having to first reveal any personal information such as a name or e-mail address. **[Please send us any feedback](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205081922id_/http%3A//www.healthinsurance.org/writeus.lasso)you have on this service, and whether you think it is of value for our site to continue. **Read dentalplan.com's privacy policy here [using the link on the front of its homepage.](http://www.dentalplans.com/afftracker.asp?affid=17233)
