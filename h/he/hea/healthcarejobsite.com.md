**Collection and Use of Information**  


When you register with this site or one of its affiliated web sites, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to process your requests and to communicate with you about the status of your requests. For example, if you request additional information on other services, such as continuing education or student loan consolidation, we will share your information solely as is necessary to process your request. We may also use your email address to send you newsletters you are subscribed to during registration, as well as messages about any special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. 

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users at several different points on our website. When you first register with us, we ask for your email address and a password. At this time, we may subscribe you to various email publications. You can unsubscribe at any time. 

We also offer an Associate program, where associate members direct customers to the network through links on their Web sites. We ask associates for their site name (URL), mailing address, primary contact, pay-to address, technical contact, and other site-related information to determine whether a site will be included in our network. The information collected from our affiliates is used strictly for that program; none of this information is used for general marketing purposes. 

In some cases our software and web site are utilized by our partners in a joint venture via their web community. In these cases, the information collected on our site is available to both companies.

Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Recommend a Friend or Colleague**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend or colleague about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to visit the site or review the content selected by a user. We then store this information in our databases. The friend may contact us to request that we remove this information at any time.

**Security and Access**

We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

When you place an order online at Beyond.com, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. Artemis HR uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.

Users should not post personal information to any site if they are uncomfortable with the security of the site.  If you have any questions, please contact us.  Back to top

**Children**

This site is not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly or specifically collect information about children. This site does not and will not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent's permission. We believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal information. If you are concerned about your child's use of this site, we encourage you to use web-filtering technology to supervise your child's access to the site. For children 14 and up (high-school age), we also encourage you to participate in your child's experience with our site. With a little guidance, this site can prove very useful in finding a part-time or summer job for your child, as well as providing them with excellent career counseling information.
