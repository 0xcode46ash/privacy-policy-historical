By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described herein. HealthiNation may need to change this privacy policy and how we handle PII from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, changes on our sites, or business practices. HealthiNation will post those changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back to this policy regularly. 

**What type of PII does HealthiNation collect from you and how do we use it?**  
As stated above, you may provide certain PII to HealthiNation in order to have access to certain features on our Website(s).
