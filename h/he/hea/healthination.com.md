# HealthiNation - Privacy Policy - HealthiNation.com

Welcome to [www.healthination.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “Website”), operated by HealthiNation, a New York company (“HealthiNation”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how HealthiNation collects and uses your personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other information in operating the Website. 

**How does the Website Work?**  
The Website offers anonymous browsers and users who voluntarily provide us with certain PII (collectively “you” or “your”) access to various health-related information. You do not have to provide any PII to us in order to use the Website, but you may voluntarily submit certain PII if, for instance, you wish to receive our newsletters or wish us to respond to a request. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described herein. HealthiNation reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect and process through the Website at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes and such changes will take effect immediately once posted. 

**What type of PII does HealthiNation collect from you and how do we use it?**  
As stated above, you may provide certain PII to HealthiNation in order to have access to certain features on the Website. Such PII shall include basic biographical and contact information, such as your name and email address. We may also ask you for general statistical, non-PII about yourself and your interests. Unless you provide PII to HealthiNation through the Website, we will not collect any PII from you. HealthiNation may provide your PII to entities who work on behalf of or with us. These entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website. 

For instance, we may transfer information collected at registration, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in running the Website and to third party vendors in order to execute transactions requested by you. 

HealthiNation values your trust. HealthiNation DOES NOT share any of your PII with any third parties for direct marketing or other purposes, and will only use this information to service your opt-in requests, such as receiving our HealthiNation newsletters. 

**Under what circumstances may we release PII?**  
We may release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Website users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII. 

**What other information does HealthiNation collect?**  
We also collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes. 

**Do I have the ability to not be identified by HealthiNation?**  
Yes. If you do not want to be identified by us, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. If you do not want us to have any of your PII, do not submit any of your PII to us. 

**Who stores the information we collect?**  
HealthiNation maintains our own secure database, in which we store the user information you may provide to us. We contract with Constant Contact, an email database service, to distribute our electronic newsletters. Therefore, if you opt in to receive our newsletter, your email address is shared with and housed on Constant Contact’s database(s). 

**How do we store information and how long do we store it?**  
HealthiNation takes steps consistent with commercially reasonable industry standards to secure any PII collected from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access and destruction while under our control. Please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. HealthiNation stores the information you provide to us in an active database in perpetuity, subject to our discretion, unless you opt-out. 

**Does HealthiNation provide links to other websites?**  
HealthiNation may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we have no control over such websites or resources, the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this Privacy Policy. 

**What are our policies regarding children?**  
HealthiNation will not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. 

**Do we have a mechanism to address the removal, change of, or amendment to PII and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?**
