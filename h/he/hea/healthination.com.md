# HealthiNation - Privacy Policy - HealthiNation.com

Welcome to [www.healthination.com](http://www.healthination.com/) (the "Website(s), referred to herein sometimes collectively as either the "Website" or "Website(s)"), operated by HealthiNation, a New York company ("HealthiNation", "we", "our", or "us"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how HealthiNation collects and uses your personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information in operating our Website(s). 

**1\. How does the Website Work?**

The Website offers anonymous Internet users, who may voluntarily provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information (also referred to as PII), with access to various health-related information. You (collectively "you" or "your") do not have to provide any PII to us in order to use our Website, but you may voluntarily submit certain PII if, for example, you wish to receive our newsletters or wish us to respond to a request. By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described herein. HealthiNation may need to change this Privacy Policy and how we handle PII from time to time in order to address new issues, evolving technologies, changes on our Website, or changes in our business practices. HealthiNation will post those changes so you will always know what information we gather and how we might use that information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly. 

**2\. What type of PII does HealthiNation collect from you and how do we use it?**

As stated above, you may provide certain PII to HealthiNation in order to have access to certain features on our Website(s). Such PII shall include basic biographical and contact information, e.g., your name and email address. We may also ask you for general statistical, non-personal information about yourself and your interests. Unless you provide PII to HealthiNation through our Website, we will not collect any PII from you.   
HealthiNation uses the information we collect in a variety of ways. First, upon registering with HealthiNation, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to create a customized Web experience for you and to improve our services. We may use PII to: 

  * Receive feedback on editorial content.
  * Sign you up for an emailed newsletter or enter you into a sweepstakes. 
  * Present you with targeted advertising on the Site, based on your health interests. 
  * Statistically analyze user behavior. 
  * Develop products, marketing, and promotions internally at HealthiNation. 
  * Contact you regarding your account status or changes to our Terms and Conditions or our Privacy Policy.
  * Contact you for feedback and surveys via e-mail.
  * Send you general and administrative information about your HealthiNation registration via e-mail.



  
Second, like most Web sites, we accept advertising and sponsorships. It is because of these relationships that we are able to provide you with health content free of charge. We may use your PII to measure the effectiveness of marketing programs run against HealthiNation content. So, for example, we may match the PII that you provide to us with information from other sources, such as individual prescription drug information provided by a third party. We use this information to conduct internal market research and to prepare reports and analyses for our clients. However, our reports and analyses provided to clients and partners contain only anonymous data. Our advertising clients do not see an individual's Personally Identifiable Information and CANNOT associate any of the information they see with a particular individual. 

**3\. Under what circumstances may we release PII?**

We may release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Website users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII.  
You acknowledge that HealthiNation is located in the United States of America ("U.S.") and will process and store your information in the U.S., and that as a result, U.S. governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through upholding the laws of the U.S. 

**4\. What other information does HealthiNation collect?**

We also collect anonymous and aggregate information from your computer about your usage and preferences in navigating the Website by using "cookies" (see Section 6. below for more on the specific type of cookies), action tags and other methods.   
Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes.

Third-party cookies are used for targeting and retargeting of online advertising. Third-party cookies are also used for measurement and analysis of audience data including market research.

**6\. What types of cookies might be used?**

In order to track your use of our Website, "cookies" are employed. We use two types of cookies—so-called "browser cookies" and "Flash cookies". Browser cookies (also called "HTTP cookies") are pieces of information that are sent by websites and stored in your computer's hard drive, which provide you a service by allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our Website. These cookies also allow us to learn how visitors use our Website. This user data is aggregated for tracking purposes primarily by tallying pages viewed throughout our Website and logging Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser types, general geographic origin of access to our sites and similar aggregated usage data. Flash cookies (also called "Locally Stored Objects" or "LSOs") work in a similar manner to browser cookies and are also used to remember settings and preferences and to track usage. However, they relate to certain Flash content such as animations, quizzes, interactive features, and videos, are stored differently on your hard drive and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. In general, Flash cookies are more persistent and can store more data that browser cookies. 

**7\. I really don't want my page visits to be tracked at all. How do I disable tracking again?**

As described above, in the course of serving advertisements to our Website, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a browser or Flash cookie on your hard drive. However, if you turn cookies off (whether browser cookies or Flash cookies), you will not have access to some HealthiNation features and services. 

  * If you do not want to receive browser cookies, you may set your browser to reject them.
  * If you wish to disable or delete Flash cookies, you should consult the Help file for your Flash application.
  * If you want to fully opt-out of all tracking, HealthiNation recommends that you use the "Private Browsing" and/or "Do Not Track" features of your browser. 



**8\. Who stores the PII information we collect for our email newsletter?**

HealthiNation maintains a secure database, via our email database service provider Constant Contact, in which we store the user information you may provide to us. We contract with Constant Contact in order to distribute our electronic newsletters. Therefore, if you opt in to receive our newsletter, your email address is shared with and housed on Constant Contact’s database(s). 

**9\. How do we store information and how long do we store it?**

HealthiNation takes steps consistent with commercially reasonable industry standards to secure any PII collected from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access and destruction while under our control. Please note that despite our efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. HealthiNation stores the information you provide to us in an active database in perpetuity, subject to our discretion, unless you opt-out. 

**10\. Does HealthiNation provide links to other websites?**

HealthiNation may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you.

You should consult privacy policies for all other sites, as HealthiNation has no control over information submitted to or collected by such third parties.

These third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. HealthiNation has no control over the third-party sponsor's use of this information. Our Website will inform you at the time of requesting PII if third-party sponsors will be provided with such information. 

**11\. What are our policies regarding children?**

**12\. Do we have a mechanism to address the removal, change of, or amendment to PII and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?**
