# HealthiNation.com: Privacy Policy - HealthiNation.com

Welcome to [www.healthination.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “Website”), operated by HealthiNation, a New York company (“HealthiNation”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how HealthiNation collects and uses your personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other information in operating the Website. 

**How does the Website Work?**  
The Website offers anonymous browsers and users who voluntarily provide us with certain PII (collectively “you” or “your”) access to various health-related information. You do not have to provide any PII to us in order to use the Website, but you may voluntarily submit certain PII if, for instance, you wish to receive our newsletters or wish us to respond to a request. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described herein. HealthiNation reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect and process through the Website at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes and such changes will take effect immediately once posted. 

**What type of PII does HealthiNation collect from you and how do we use it?**  
As stated above, you may provide certain PII to HealthiNation in order to have access to certain features on the Website. Such PII shall include basic biographical and contact information, such as your name and email address. We may also ask you for general statistical, non-PII about yourself and your interests. Unless you provide PII to HealthiNation through the Website, we will not collect any PII from you. HealthiNation may provide your PII to entities who work on behalf of or with us. These entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website. 

For instance, we may transfer information collected at registration, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in running the Website and to third party vendors in order to execute transactions requested by you.   
HealthiNation also may share your PII with third parties for direct marketing and other purposes, and you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you would rather us not share your PII with the any third party for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to HealthiNation through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an “Opt-Out Request”) to us at: 35 East 21st Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10010, or by email at [optout@healthination.com](mailto:optout@healthination.com). 

Please note that it may take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing. 

Please note that if we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes or having otherwise transferred or disposed of your PII, HealthiNation may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by any third party, and in such an event you agree that HealthiNation shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about HealthiNation sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide your PII to HealthiNation. 

**Under what other circumstances may we release PII?**  
We may also release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Website users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII. 

**What other information does HealthiNation collect?**  
We also collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes.

You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. If you do not want us to have any of your PII, do not submit any of your PII to us. 

**How do we store information?**  
HealthiNation takes steps consistent with commercially reasonable industry standards to secure any PII collected from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access and destruction while under our control.

**Does HealthiNation provide links to other websites?**  
HealthiNation may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you.
