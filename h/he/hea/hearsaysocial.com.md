This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including: <https://hearsaysocial.com/>, <https://my.hearsaysocial.com/> (collectively referred to as “Hearsay’s Websites” or “the Company’s Websites”).

Hearsay may allow access to third party social media websites via its Services.  When those sites are made available by Hearsay and the application links to this Privacy Statement, this Privacy Statement applies. When applications are posted by third parties, the privacy statement of the third party applies, and this Privacy Statement does not apply.

The Services also enable Hearsay Customers to create websites that are hosted by Hearsay. When Customer Sites are hosted by Hearsay, Hearsay will perform its duties required under its license agreement with Hearsays Customers pursuant to this Privacy Statement; however, this Privacy Statement does not necessarily apply to any website activity that occurs on the Customer Sites.

Hearsay’s Websites and Services may contain links to other Websites. The information practices or the content of such other Websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other Websites. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Websites to understand their information practices.

Data you give to us directly.  
On some places on the Hearsay Website, you can fill in a web form to share your data (i.e., name, e-mail address, address, phone number, etc.) with us directly, such as on our [“Contact Us”](https://hearsaysocial.com/company/contact/) page, on our [“Request a Demo”](https://info.hearsaysocial.com/demo-hearsay.html) page, or on our [blog](https://hearsaysocial.com/insights/blog/) home page. We collect the information you provide in response to those web forms. Occasionally, we may also offer opportunities for you to share your data with us such as through a survey, to sign up for a newsletter, or to register for or receive details about an event we are sponsoring. If you participate in those surveys, sign up for a newsletter, or register for an event, we will collect the information you provide to us in doing so.

Hearsay Social collects the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, contact information of Users that communicate through other channels (such as phone number and physical address), information on what pages Users visit on the Hearsay Website, IP addresses of those accessing the Hearsay Website, information volunteered by the User (such as survey information), and information collected from the End User of the Service (e.g. name) (“Hearsay Data”).  This also includes information on the senders and recipients of communications sent using Hearsay Services (including Mail and Messages), by the End User of the Service and the people they are communicating with (“End User Contacts”).  We may also monitor the online activity of End User Contacts that provide information to the Services, such as their interaction with End User websites, social media,  and other online content related to the End User.  We collect this information on behalf of our End Users to enable them to provide better services.

Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses  
When you visit the Hearsay Website, we and our service providers acting on our behalf automatically collect certain data using tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.

These technologies are used to help us better understand user behavior and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our Hearsay Website. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.

We use cookies to record current session information.  We also use third party cookies (e.g. Google Analytics) to provide anonymized and aggregated information on website usage statistics and patterns.

All modern Internet browsers allow you to control your cookie settings. These settings are usually accessed in the ‘Options’ or ‘Preferences’ section of your browser. On your mobile device, go to Settings, then go to the specific web-browser, and then to the Cookies section. Please note that certain features of the website will not be available once cookies are disabled.  For further information about cookies and how to manage them, please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Hearsay uses web beacons with cookies or separately to compile information about Users’ usage of the Company’s Websites and interaction with the Company, its Customers, or End Users through Hearsay emails and Services.  Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon.

When you visit the Hearsay Website, we collect your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”) to monitor the regions from which you navigate the Hearsay Website.

Social Media Features  
We allow you to “Connect With Us” through various social media networks through our website. Clicking on these links takes you away from the Hearsay Website to the Hearsay Website on those specific social media networks ([Hearsay on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hearsaysocial), [Hearsay on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hearsaysocial), [Hearsay on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hearsay-social), [Hearsay on Google+](https://plus.google.com/+HearsaySocial/posts)).

Each third party website and social media network has its own terms and privacy policy regarding information stored, collected, processed and shared on those respective website and networks.  So, your participation with Hearsay on those websites and social media networks is subject to the websites’ and social media networks’ terms and privacy policy, not ours.

You should not provide Hearsay with any personally identifiable information (or post any personally identifiable information to the Hearsay Website) unless you would like that information to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Do Not Track Statement  
Certain internet web browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, we do not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.  Learn more about DNT [here](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

Hearsay is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these Forums.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy, please contact us first at privacy@hearsaysocial.com. If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may file a complaint, free of charge, with the [EU Data Protection Authorities (EU DPAs)](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).

Further, as explained in the [Privacy Shield Principles](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/media/files/2016/eu_us_privacy_shield_full_text.pdf.pdf), a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means.

You have the right to access your personal information that we control and request rectifications of any personal information that may be obsolete, incomplete or incorrect. We will need to validate your identity in order to implement such a request to ensure that we do not provide your information to anyone who does not have the right to that information. In some cases, we will not be able to provide the information we hold about you. That may occur if: (1) it contains reference to other persons; except where those persons have given their consent to the disclosure or the disclosure is reasonable without their consent; or (2) it is subject to solicitor-client (attorney-client) privilege or litigation privilege.

All Services are accessible via an internet browser and certain services also have a mobile app. Generally, our Customers are companies who give their employees, contractors and agents access to the Hearsay Services (those individuals are collectively, “End Users”).

Collection of personally identifiable information we control  
Hearsay Social collects the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, contact information of Users that communicate through other channels (such as phone number and physical address), information on what pages Users visit on the Hearsay Website, IP addresses of those accessing the Hearsay Website, information volunteered by the user (such as survey information), and information collected from the User of the Service (e.g. name) (“Hearsay Data”).  This also includes information on the senders and recipients of communications sent using Hearsay Services (including Mail and Messages), by the User of the Service and the people they are communicating with.

Use of personally identifiable information  
The Hearsay Data we collect and process is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our Services and to contact Users.

Data we process as a data processor to provide the Hearsay Social Service  
We act as a data processor for our Customers that use the Service. We process information that our Users and/or Customer’s End User Contacts provide, or grant us access to, after either (i) giving their explicit consent to connect their social media accounts to the Service; or (ii) submitting their contact information (name, job title, company name, business address, and/or phone number to the Service (“Services Data”).  We may use Services Data across multiple products to enable End User Contact communications, such as sending and receiving email, sending and receiving text messages, populating website information at the request of End User’s organization, and other digital communications. Services Data processed includes the content of any posts End User Contacts make to social media sites in order to enable our Customers to monitor the social media activity of its Users. We use the Services Data solely in order to provide the Service in accordance with our license agreement.  Such use includes:

  * Monitoring: Our Service monitors content posted to connected social media accounts in accordance with the terms our license agreement.
  * Multi-Service Use: If an End User purchases or is otherwise granted a license to another Hearsay Service, we may use Services Data derived from the End User’s social media account to populate information within the additional Hearsay Service.  For example, we may populate Hearsay Sites contact information with a Customer’s business address or an individual End User’s business address from his or her social media account.   When an End User deactivates his or her Hearsay Social account from the Hearsay Social Engage Solution platform, the token will be deleted from our Service and our Service will have no access to such accounts.  We may, however, continue to include Services Data derived from social media within another Hearsay Service for as long as the End User maintains a license for the particular Hearsay Service, unless the End User (or the Customer on behalf of the End User) submits a request for deletion of Services Data to [privacy@hearsaysocial.com](mailto:privacy@hearsaysocial.com).
  * Authentication: Once a registered End User links his or her social media account to our Hearsay Social Engage Solution platform, we request and subsequently store an End User access token for such account. This will only occur if the End User explicitly grants permission. Our platform is then able to access content of posts and other interactions within that social media account and also write information to that social network account when explicitly instructed to do so by the registered End User.
  * Analysis: Our Services monitor information posted or sent, and the corresponding responses or engagements (any actions taking on the piece of content that is trackable) to report on, analyze and better understand the expected responses to posting or sending additional content broadly, or to a specific individual.
  * Disclosure to Customers: Our Service provides supervision capability for each Customer to report on content, and review of content, posted by their employees, contractors and personnel that have connected their accounts to our service.
