        Hearsay Social privacy practices
        This document describes Hearsay Social’s privacy policy respecting information we receive about you via
        email or website use. Hearsay Social recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we
        may collect from our website users. We are responsible for personal information under our control and have a
        Privacy Officer to receive and respond to requests for personal information held by us and correction of such
        personal information.
        Confidentiality
        We have comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized review and use of the personal
        information that is submitted to us, including electronic safeguards such as encryption software and firewalls.
        Access to personal information is restricted to authorized employees only.
        Collection of personally identifiable information and consent
        Hearsay Social collects the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, information on
        what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by the user (such as survey information). Your
        consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information can be express and positive (may
        be verbal, in writing or electronic) or implied, such as by using one of our products or services, or by not
        responding to our offer to remove your personal information from our contact list, in which case we assume
        your consent. You may withdraw or refuse your consent at any time for any purpose whatsoever, as long as
        you give us reasonable notice of withdrawal.
        Use and Disclosure of personally identifiable information
        The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our services, and is
        not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes except to provide information,
        products or services requested by a user or under the following circumstances:
               •   It is necessary to disclose information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
                   illegal activities (including cooperating with governmental authorities regarding the investigation of
                   illegal activities), suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
                   person, or as otherwise required by law.
               •   We transfer information about you to a successor or acquirer of Hearsay Social, in which case such
                   successor’s or acquirer’s use of such information shall be subject to this privacy policy.
        Information Usage
        Hearsay Social uses collected information for the following general purposes: identification and
        authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
        Authentication
        Hearsay Social requests and stores user access tokens for authentication on social networks. This will only
        occur if the user explicitly grants permission in the sign up process. The access token will allow Hearsay
        Social to read information from personal social networks. It will also write information to personal social
        networks when explicitly granted permission. When a user deactivates his or her HSS account the token will
        not be used anymore.
        Cookies
