# Heavy Harmonies - Privacy Statement

**_Nov. 18, 2003_ \- Ratings option turned back on for all site visitors. Be forewarned, if you abuse the disc ratings function, I can and will disable the ability to rate the CD. **  
---  
**_Nov. 10, 2003_ \- In response to action by BMI/RIAA, all audio has been removed from the site. This includes the "Song of the Week", which will not be returning. If you represent a band that wishes to have their audio clips played here, that's fine, however I will need explicit permission in writing, as well as written waiver of any BMI/ASCAP/SOCAN performance royalties. -Dan**
