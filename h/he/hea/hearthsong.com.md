If you give us your telephone number online, we may call you about your order.

Also, we collect your comments so we can better serve you in the future. Of course for orders, your items, the quantity of each item and bank card number with its expiration date is collected. 

We are committed to data security and the accuracy of our information (see Our [Security Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/19990505181612id_/http%3A//www.hearthsong.com/service/security.cfm)) received from domestic and foreign visitors to our site.

The only exception in response to your specific request for merchandise or information. It should be noted that if you do allow us to share information, the other companies may be governed by different privacy policies.
