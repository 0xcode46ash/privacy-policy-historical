At HealthEquity, protecting your privacy and security is our top priority. We understand the importance of security when managing your financial information online and over the phone.

  * Never give out your Health Account number, Health Account debit card or Social Security number to solicitors or callers that you have not contacted.
  * Never give out your password for your HSA login.
  * Check your Health Account frequently using the HealthEquity member portal and contact us if you notice any suspicious activity.
  * Receive and pay bills online instead of by mail with the HealthEquity member payment portal. The less biller information in your mailbox, the better.

### Our commitment to privacy

Your privacy is important to us. As part of providing our services to you, you understand that we will obtain personal information about you. We take the responsibility of maintaining the confidentiality of this information seriously. This privacy notice is provided so that you will be aware of the measures we take to protect your privacy. It also describes information we collect and how we use this information to conduct our business. **We do not sell our customer lists or individual customer information.** By using our site you consent to this Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of information about you in the manner described in this Policy.

The following is a nonexhaustive list of information we collect about you in order to provide services to you:

  * Name
  * Physical Address
  * Social Security Number
  * Date of Birth
  * Email Address
  * Phone Number



### How we use information

We retain your personal information in order to provide products and services and may, from time to time, provide such information to nonaffiliated third party service providers to perform services for or functions on behalf of us, to effect, administer, or enforce transactions authorized by you; for example, 

  * To verify your identity, open and administer your accounts and provide other financial services under the USA PATRIOT Act
  * To open and administer your accounts and provide other financial services
  * To make payments to medical service providers
  * To help us protect you and us from financial loss
  * To prepare account statements
  * To prepare annual tax reporting information, if applicable



We may also exchange information with reputable reference sources or reporting agencies for risk management, and verification, in order to maximize the accuracy, and security of your personal information. Only information needed to service your account or protect against fraud will be used or provided, in accordance with standard industry practice, unless we are required or allowed to do so by law. We will not market additional products or services to you if you advise us that you do not wish for us to do so.

In addition, we will collect and store the following:

  * Names and ID of people authorized by you to use your account
  * Names and ID of people authorized by you to access your account information

  * From your employer or health plan, if you enrolled through them
  * Information from public sources such as government records
  * From information you provide us on our website



### Our information security standards

We have developed policies and procedures to keep your personal information confidential and secure. We restrict access to those employees and other persons who must use that information to provide services on our behalf. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards, to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we obtain.

We require our service providers to maintain the same level of confidentiality and security that we do. We continually update and improve our security standards and procedures to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your confidential information and to prevent fraud.

### Online Privacy and Security

We collect and use the information you provide us online to respond to your needs, service your accounts, and provide online transaction services. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide us with that information through email or online applications. 

### Use of "Cookies" on HealthEquity’s Web Sites

While visitors to our Web site(s) remain anonymous, we do occasionally utilize "cookies" to provide a more valuable experience. Such cookies are used only to enhance the customer’s experience. We do not use cookies for marketing purposes. (A cookie is a small text file sent by a Web server and stored on your hard drive in your browser. Cookies cannot "read" information about you from your computer or be used to "steal" information about you; cookies do not carry viruses and are not programs that can perform functions on your computer. Most browsers will allow you to disable cookies, or can be set to notify you when you receive a cookie, thus giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.) If you choose to disable cookies certain functionality on the website may be impaired or may not work at all.

### IDs and passwords

To access certain online services, you will need a User ID and a Password. This information may either be provided to you or you will be allowed to choose your own. The User ID and Password are designed to protect you by confirming your identity to our computer network systems, and are to be kept confidential. Our employees do not have access to your password. It is very important that you not share this information or allow a computer to "remember" your password, particularly if you are using a computer with public access such as one located in a library. For additional security, you may be required to change your password from time to time.

### Other Authorized Users of the Account

Depending on the type of account, the primary account holder may grant the authority to someone else to use the account (such as a spouse, dependent, or a legal representative). The primary account holder is at all times responsible for the transactions those authorized individuals made. Those authorized users will have access to the account balance if they are properly authenticated by our system. The primary account holder should inform those individuals that he/she can see ALL of the transactions those individuals made, and therefore, should have no expectations of privacy.

Depending on the type of account, the primary account holder may grant the authority to someone else to access the account information, including all transaction history. This authority is different from the right to use the account. If the primary account holder grants authority to access the account, once we authenticate the individual’s identity, that individual will have full access to the account information, just like the primary account holder.

### Encryption and Security

Information provided via our web portal is submitted within a secure session. These sessions utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly known as SSL) technology in order to ensure that the information is encrypted while in transit. Your browser must be able to support this technology in order to use our web services.

### E-mail

E-mail, by nature, is not secure and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending email that contains any confidential or private information, such as your member ID, your social security, or credit card number. We will not send you any email that contains confidential information that would allow identity theft (such as SSN) or contains protected information (such as your health information).

### Other HealthEquity services

If you have a Health Savings Account, and your account balance exceeds a certain minimum (normally $7,500, but varies depending on how your account was established), you will be eligible to use our web-only investment advisor services offered by HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, a wholly owned company of HealthEquity, Inc. If you choose to use HealthEquity Advisors, LLC services, your consent to make all account information contained in HealthEquity, Inc.’s system available to HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, and further authorize the use of those information to provide you with the services. Finally, in order for HealthEquity Advisors, LLC to provide you with meaningful information, you will be asked to provide complete and accurate financial information not contained in our system. If you provide such information, you are consenting to the use of the information as described in HealthEquity Advisors, LLC user/services agreement. 

### Links to other web sites

HealthEquity works with a number of other companies to ensure that we are providing the value and service you expect. Some of these companies offer "co-branded" or "alliance" products; others may be third parties who provide additional online products and services. By using their services you are authorizing us to share and/or provide private information to them, which may be stored on their servers. You will see a disclosure on our site that alerts you when you are leaving our Web site. These parties often have their own privacy policies, and may have online data collection policies that may differ from ours. Although we encourage these parties to adopt and follow privacy procedures, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information and our Privacy Notice does not cover their information practices. Therefore, for your protection, we recommend that you review the privacy notices provided on their Web sites.

### Links from employers or health plans

If your account was established by your employer or your health plan, they may have requested that we setup a communication channel whereby you can log into HealthEquity’s portal through their site without entering your user name and password again. This is known as "Single Sign On." When you use Single Sign On, you are authorizing HealthEquity’s system to pass on certain personal information, such as your account balances, to those systems. Similar to the other linked websites described above, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information and our Privacy Notice does not cover their information practices. You should review the privacy notices provided on their Web sites before using the Single Sign On feature.

### Opt out instructions

If you wish to be excluded from HealthEquity’s marketing efforts, or terminate the sharing of information where permitted by your health plan or employer service agreement with HealthEquity , simply call HealthEquity toll-free at 866.346.5800.

### California and Vermont privacy notice

For California and Vermont residents, the information sharing practices described above are in accordance with federal law. California and Vermont law places additional restrictions on sharing information about their residents, and our policies comply with such restrictions.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you, if you are a California resident, to request certain information regarding disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to legal@healthequity.com or write us at Privacy Officer, HealthEquity, Inc., 15 W Scenic Pointe Drive, Suite 100, Draper, UT 84020.

Cal. Bus. And Prof. Code Section 22575 also requires us to notify you how we deal with the "Do Not Track" settings in your browser. Currently, HealthEquity’s system does not respond to the Do Not Track settings.

### Nevada privacy notice

Nevada law requires that we also provide Nevada residents with the following contact information: Bureau of Consumer Protection, Office of the Nevada Attorney General, 555 E Washington St., Suite 3900, Las Vegas, NV 89101; phone: 702.486.3132; e-mail: [BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us](mailto:BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us).

We hope our Privacy Notice will help you understand how we collect and share information. If you have any questions, please contact us. We are required by federal and state law to provide you with a copy of our Privacy Notice every twelve months. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice, in whole or in part, by providing notice in accordance with applicable law.

### Entities covered by this privacy policy

Unless we specifically named an entity, this privacy policy covers both HealthEquity, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to HealthEquity Advisors, LLC.
