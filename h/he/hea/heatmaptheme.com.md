### HeatMap Insider Forum House Rules v1.3

**PLEASE READ…  
Your usage of the HeatMap Insider forum implies that you agree to these terms: **

**Short version:**

0\. Backup Backup Backup!  
1\. Dont PM the Author with support questions. Use the Forum!  
2\. Play Nice. Mind your manners. Real Humans live here  
3\. Installation support only is provided as part of membership  
4\. Other types of support are at the Authors discretion  
5\. Provide full details when asking questions  
6\. One question per post  
7(a). No Forum SPAM… ever!   
7(b). Declare all affiliate links with the [AFF] suffix  
8\. Keep it clean. No potty mouths  
9\. Talk about HeatMap Theme related topics only (except in Insiders Cafe which is for general chat)  
10\. White Hat Only. No Black Hats!  
11\. Don’t share your account details with others. Keep your password to yourself.

**Longer version**

**Rule 0(!) Backup, Backup, Backup**  
All hacks, tips, customisations, patches and downloads in this forum are used at your own risk. Before doing anything else make sure you backup your WordPress files, theme files and your database (and ensure you know how to restore your backups).

**Rule 1. Use The Support Forums and Help Each Other**  
The support forums are where helpful members of the HeatMap Insider community (including myself ) can assist you. Feel free to help others if you know the answer. Don’t PM or personally email me for support. That’s what the forums are for. 

**Rule 2. Play Nice**  
Be considerate to each other and myself. This is a happy place. Don’t spoil the vibe. I answer questions as quickly as I can, but remember, I am most probably in a different time zone to you, I have to sleep, rest at the weekend and sometimes take a break like a regular human being 

**Rule 3. Installation Support Only**  
Only Installation support is included in the price of the theme to get you up and running as per the features shown in the theme demo at the time of purchase.  Advice and assistance for theme customisation and tweaking,  non HeatMap Theme plugins, and general WordPress problems is not included, but may be provided, at my discretion and as my time allows.

>> **[Read more about what kind of support you can expect](http://heatmaptheme.com/what-kind-of-support-is-provided/)**

**Rule 4. Additional Services**  
Additional services and support such as theme customisation, and issues outside of the scope of HeatMap Theme itself such as complex plugin issues or support of the WordPress software itself may be available on a separately charged basis. I will quote you privately by email or PM before performing any additional services work on your behalf.

**Rule 5. Provide full details**  
When you are having a problem please supply as much detail as possible so that helpful forum members (including myself) can try and reproduce it. Post a link to the site you are working on so we can see the issue. Post a screenshot if you can’t point us to a live site.

**Rule 6. One Question per Post**  
Make the Post Title Meaningful. Don’t ask more than one question per post, and make the post title meaningful using well chosen keywords so that others who have the same problem can find the solution.

**Rule 7. No SPAM… ever**  
Don’t spam or anything like it. Spamming will result in an immediate ban from this forum. Spam also includes making obviously self serving posts which are created solely for the purpose of driving traffic to your site, or generating affiliate or advertising revenue, and which lower the quality of posts on the HeatMap Insider. If you are recommending that someone visit an affiliate link, please designate the link with the [aff] suffix, so we know that you will be rewarded for the recommendation. Don’t create posts with affiliate links unless you are making a genuine ‘from experience’ recommendation that will be useful to fellow HeatMap Insider members.

**Rule 8. Keep it clean**  
Don’t be rude, vulgar, use bad language or disrespectful of anyone. We want to keep this a safe friendly place.

**Rule 9. HeatMap Theme only**  
Don’t ask questions or post about other themes or plugins that are unrelated to HeatMap Theme. You may chat about plugins as they relate to use with HeatMap theme. Posts which are unrelated to HeatMap Theme will be deleted.

**Rule 10. White Hat and Black Hat topics**  
**DO** talk about White Hat Techniques for increasing your site traffic, inbound links, increasing your adsense and affiliate earnings, improving search engine placement, making a living out of your blog etc.

**DON’T** post anything related to Black Hat topics or any other practices of any kind which are either illegal, generally a nuisance to users of the internet or that just fill the internet with junk (for example – scraping, spam blogging, keyword spamming, keyword arbitrage, autoblogging to create search engine spam blogs scraped from rss feeds, ready-made-for-adsense websites, adsense clicking networks etc).

**Rule 11.** **Your account is for your own personal use**

Your membership account is provided to you on the understanding that your account is for your own personal use. You must not share it with others, or reveal your account access details to others. If your account trips our account misuse detection measures, then your account may be suspended until we have determined the cause. We reserve the right to suspend an account permanently should the account be found to be in violation of these terms.

**Who’s to judge anyway?**  
I don’t make any judgement on what you personally do with HeatMap Theme but please know that any posts related to what I consider to be black hat or spammy, illegal or deceptive practices will be deleted from this forum. Also, don’t engage in any Black Hat activity of any kind within this forum (such as placing tracking bugs within posts etc).

If you break any of the above rules or the terms of site usage, I will either delete or edit offending posts, issue you with a warning, revoke your posting rights, or ban you permanently at my discretion. There are no refunds in the case of a permanent ban.

I really really don’t ever want to have to do this to anyone, so please respect the rules of the house and we’ll all get along just fine.

_*These rules are are subject to amendment from time to time and I reserve the right to do so at any time. The Site Admin’s decision is final. No correspondence will be entered into. Caveat Emptor and all that. Having said all that…Enjoy the forum fellow HeatMapsters!_
