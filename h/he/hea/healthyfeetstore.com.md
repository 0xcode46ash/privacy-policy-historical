**Security**  
When you place an order at Healthy Feet Store, you can rest assured that the payment information you provide will only be viewed by those with the proper authorization. As soon as you click on the Submit Secure Order button at the bottom of our order form, our secure server software encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels across the Internet. On-line shopping at healthyfeetstore.com is both convenient AND safe! You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on this site to fulfill your requests and enhance your overall experience. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. Sensitive information you provide will be processed by our secure Web server at Yahoo. 

**If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at **1.866.324.3338** or via email at ****[cservice@healthyfeetstore.com](mailto:cservice@healthyfeetstore.com)**
