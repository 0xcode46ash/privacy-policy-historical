**HealthLeadersMedia Privacy Policy**

  1. **General**

_HealthLeadersMedia, a division of HCPro, Inc._ respects the privacy of every individual who visits or is a member of _HealthLeadersMedia_ ("HealthLeadersMedia.com"). _HealthLeadersMedia_ wants you to fully understand what information we gather from you, how that information is collected, how that information is used, and how you can control the collection and/or use of information about you. So please read this Policy carefully. 

  2. **Personally Identifiable Information**

There are cases in which _HealthLeadersMedia_ may ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address. For example, we request personally identifiable information for online shopping or transactions or for other services that require registration or subscription. We may also collect information from e-mail, letters, or other correspondence that you send us. _HealthLeadersMedia_ will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily, with the exception of your computer's IP address. The IP address is an identifier unique to each computer or Internet usage session. 

When you do provide us with personally identifiable information, _HealthLeadersMedia_ may: 

    * Store and process that information to enhance your experience with _HealthLeadersMedia_ so that we provide a service that is relevant and easy to use; 
    * Use that information to contact you for informational, marketing, and promotional purposes on behalf of _HealthLeadersMedia_ and third parties, including such benefits as welcoming you back to _HealthLeadersMedia_ or informing you of service enhancements or promotional items; 
    * To the extent required to provide our services, share personally identifiable information with any merchants that may offer their products and services through _HealthLeadersMedia_ ; 
    * Share information about your product purchases through _HealthLeadersMedia_ with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, or other third parties; 
    * Disclose that information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) _HealthLeadersMedia_ 's rights or property, other members or users of _HealthLeadersMedia_ , or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and 
    * Disclose that information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction; and 
    * As _HealthLeadersMedia_ continues to develop its business, we may sell or buy other businesses or assets. A buyer or successor will have access to our customer lists as this information is considered a transferable business asset. 

Except as stated in this Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time that the personally identifiable information is gathered, we will not provide personally identifiable information to third parties. 

  3. **Nonpersonally Identifiable Information**

_HealthLeadersMedia_ may also collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information may include your age, gender, interests and preferences, the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the company or organizational Web site from which you linked to _HealthLeadersMedia_. _HealthLeadersMedia_ may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, or other third parties. For example, _HealthLeadersMedia_ may inform a sponsor that membership of _HealthLeadersMedia_ is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize _HealthLeadersMedia_ 's content and advertising and to deliver better experience to our members and users.

The importance of security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us.

While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, _HealthLeadersMedia_ can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
