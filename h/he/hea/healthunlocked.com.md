# Privacy statement - HealthUnlocked

November 2012

At HealthUnlocked we believe in the potential of shared experiences to transform lives and uncover understanding in health. Because this may involve you sharing sensitive information about your health and treatment we also believe in the importance of clear and transparent privacy guidelines. As a user it’s important you know how we use and share your data and how you can control what happens to information you share in HealthUnlocked.

Here’s a simple guide:

## Sharing and Controlling Information

#### Who are you?

HealthUnlocked is owned and operated by Everything Unlocked Limited registered in England and Wales under company number 6596274. Its registered office is: 133 Great Suffolk Street, First floor, London SE1 1PP.

#### Who can see my personal identifiable information?

None of your personally identifiable information (email address, postcode/zipcode, date of birth) is ever visible to other users or third parties without your explicit consent. We encourage you to choose a non-identifiable username as this is visible to other users.

Who can see the blogs and questions I write?

You always choose which groups of users can see the blogs and questions you publish. You can either restrict your blog/question to members of the community or share it for others on the web. If there is anything which you are not comfortable sharing with these groups, you should not include it in blogs and questions.

Restricting questions and blogs to members of the community only also means they will not be analysed for research.

#### Who can see my non-personally identifiable information?

HealthUnlocked may anonymize and aggregate information collected through the service (e.g. polls, symptom surveys etc). This information may then be published as a study or shared with our [research partners](https://web.archive.org/about/partners). You can always control whether your information is used in this way by following the instructions below.

#### How can I control who sees my information?

You always control who can see your information and how it is shared. At any time you can change your [data sharing settings](https://web.archive.org/pages/display/help%2Findex#how-do-i-change-my-data-sharing-settings) to stop sharing information you submit with our research partners. You will still able to use our service.

#### Will I be contacted for research purposes?

We may contact you for research purposes, such as taking part in surveys or clinical trial recruitment. In this case it will always be HealthUnlocked that contacts you, not a research partner directly as we never share your email address with third parties. You can [opt out of being contacted for research purposes](https://web.archive.org/pages/display/help%2Findex#how-do-i-change-my-data-sharing-settings) at any time.

## The HealthUnlocked business model

#### How does HealthUnlocked make money?

HU Communities are free for patients and charities. In addition to our licensed softwares such as In Clinic and [GP Communities](http://www.healthunlocked.com/gpcommunities/) we work with research partners allowing them to access anonymised and aggregated data from HealthUnlocked services.

This only happens where users give their consent to share information and users can opt out at any time as set out above.

##### 1) Patient Organizations

Patient Organizations using HealthUnlocked can access and export anonymised and aggregate data reports from members within their HealthUnlocked community who have chosen to share their data.

##### 2) Doctors and other Healthcare Professionals

Doctors and Healthcare Professionals use HealthUnlocked to manage their patients online. Information will not be made available to doctors unless a patients chooses to share this information with. If patients consent, this information can also be used and aggregated for research and audit by the doctors in their academic studies.

##### 3) Institutions and Industry

Health Institutions (e.g. NHS or Department of Health) and Companies (Pharmaceuticals or Medical Devices) use HealthUnlocked to research the experience of patients. This may be analysis of data submitted by users of the HealthUnlocked service, or through more structured studies alongside doctors and patients. This only happens where users give their consent to share information and users can opt out at any time as set out above.
