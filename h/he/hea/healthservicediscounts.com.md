We do update this Policy from time to time so please review regularly.

  * To personalise and improve your experience



If you are a previous or existing customer, we may contact you with information about products and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. Furthermore, we may use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, so that you can be provided with information about unrelated products and services which we consider may be of interest to you.

## Storing Your Data

In operating our website it may become necessary to transfer data that we collect from you to locations outside of the European Union for processing and storing. By providing your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We do our upmost to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to make sure that your data is treated and stored securely.

Health Service Discounts exercises great care in providing transmission of member contact information between your PC and our servers. However no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, while we strive to protect personal information, Health Service Discounts can't ensure or warrant the security of any information a user may transmit to us and members do so at their own risk.

## Data Protection Act

In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to access any information that we hold relating to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee to cover costs incurred by providing this information.

## Security

Health Service Discounts directs members to suppliers and advertisers offering goods and services, which are available to be bought online and in some cases by phone or in store. It is these retailers and advertisers that are responsible to you for the security of transactions. Members can be reassured that while we do not offer purchasing from within this site we are rigorous in our selection of retailers and advertisers.

Registered members are responsible for the security and proper use of all passwords used in connection with the website and must take all necessary steps to ensure that they are kept confidential, secure, used properly and not disclosed to unauthorised people.

We reserve the right to suspend user ID and password access to the website if at any time Health Service Discounts considers that there is or is likely to be a breach of security.

Health Service Discounts reserves the right (at its sole discretion) to require members to change any or all of the passwords used by you in connection with the website.

## Liability

Health Service Discounts is not liable either in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise for the acts or omissions of other providers of goods or services or for faults in those goods or services.

Content is supplied to Health Service Discounts by third parties. We do not warrant or guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any of the content or any further information or results that may be derived from it. Members acknowledge that it is their responsibility to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the content. Use of the content, for whatever purpose is at members sole risk.

Members are solely responsible for evaluating any goods (including software) or services offered by third parties advertised, sold or otherwise made available on the Internet. 

Should a user have any complaint, problems or concerns regarding the purchase of goods and services, then members agree to take up that matter directly with the vendor of the goods or services in question. We will - at our discretion - however attempt to provide accurate contact information for the retailer, as well as using our retailer relationships to help with any enquiries you have.
