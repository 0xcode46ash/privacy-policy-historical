# Privacy Policy

Health Service Discounts are committed to safeguarding and preserving the privacy of members.

The privacy policy below details what information we hold on you as a member and the ways in which we use this information. We do update this Privacy Policy from time to time so please review this regularly   so you are aware of any updates.

## Personal Information & Data

## Information we collect

**Personal Data:** When you sign up as a member to Health Service Discounts, we request your name, email address, occupation and other personal information such as home address and phone number. We may also ask you to provide optional information such as your hobbies, interests and utility contract end dates such as mobile phone and energy to provide you with more relevant discounts, offers and services. We may also capture your IP address to help us understand your location so we can provide discounts and deals relevant to your locality.

We may also capture sales data you provide to our third-party partners such as product or service type and cost of product or service. We would never have access to any sensitive payment details.  
To improve your experience, we may also collect information based on your use of our website and marketing emails, including details of products you engage with, pages you visit and resources accessed.

**Sensitive Data:** We may ask for optional personal data from time to time to help in instances such as insurance comparisons. This may include information about your racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health condition and any criminal convictions or allegations of criminality.

## Information we share with others

We want to know as much as we can about our valuable members to provide the most relevant information and services to you. Considering this, we may send your information to 3rd party services with the sole objective of enhancing the data we may hold on you to gain extra information such as interests and hobbies. After receiving this information back, we would always request that the 3rd party destroys all information held on you.

This enhanced information will then be used to provide you with more relevant offers and services.

We may also share your information with trusted partners who we believe can help our members to save time and money. These selected partners may contact you from time to time via email, telephone or SMS.

## Use of Information

The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily so we can provide a much better personal experience and more relevant content. In addition to this we may use the information for one or more of the following purposes:

  * To provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services .
  * To provide information to you relating to other products that may be of interest to you.
  * To inform you of any changes to our website, services or goods and products .
  * To personalise and improve your experience.



If you are a previous or existing customer,  we may contact you with information about products and services like those which were the subject of a previous sale to you. We or trusted partners may contact you about money saving products and services by any methods that you consented at the time your information was collected.

You may stop these messages at any time by unsubscribing by opting-out using the link at the bottom of our emails .
