## Privacy Policy

LAST REVISED:  January 10, 2010

The privacy of your personal health information is very important to us. This privacy policy describes how we protect and handle the personal information that you provide and that we obtain through our web-based service at www.HealthyWage.com and related web sites (“HealthyWage”). 

**I. Introduction**  
HealthyWage uses technology and medical and wellness information to empower you to live a better life. By consolidating timely, relevant information from experts on medicine, wellness, prevention, nutrition, and fitness, HealthyWage provides you a highly personalized health and wellness program, consisting of goals, strategies, daily tasks, tips and tracking. Your HealthyWage program takes into account your personal profile, your medical data, your personal goals and preferences, and is updated constantly, as you enter information on a regular basis.

HealthyWage allows you to: (i) store and manage your health conditions and wellness goals in a central place; (ii) control your own health and wellness records; (iii) access online health management tools; (iv) receive results electronically; and (v) view your vitals and understand what they mean for you.   
Each person's information is stored and accessed separately in his or her own health and wellness record. 

**II. How It Works**  
The first time you sign in to HealthyWage, you will be asked to create an account; whether you do so is your choice. To create an account, you must provide personal information, such as your email address, name, and date of birth. To better assess your health and wellness and to create a program that is tailored just for you, HealthyWage will request additional information, such as cholesterol, height, weight, gender and age. Medical record information you provide or transfer to HealthyWage will also be used as described in this privacy policy. 

Your email address will be your username and you will be asked to create a password. We will use the email address you provide to send you an email requesting that you validate your account.   
You can review and update your account information and modify, add, or delete any optional information by signing into your HealthyWage account and editing your account profile.

Your account allows you to manage your health and wellness records and utilize the tools offered by HealthyWage. Once you have an account, you can create a personal health and wellness record for yourself. When you create a personal health and wellness record, you become a custodian of that record. You choose what information to put in your records. Examples of the types of information you can store in a record include: (i) basic health information; (ii) personal information; (iii) health concerns; (iv) health goals; (v) family history; (vi) biometric measurements, such as blood glucose and blood pressure.   
When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services. 

**III. Security of Your Personal Information**  
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide encrypted on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. We restrict access to personal information to HealthyWage employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

**IV. Account and Record Access and Controls**  
By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. You can close your account at any time by signing into your HealthyWage account and editing your account profile.

**V. How We Use Your Personal Information**  
We use personal information collected through HealthyWage, including health and wellness information, to enable the services provided through HealthyWage and as described in this privacy statement. We do not use or disclose your information except as described in this privacy statement. In support of these uses, we may use personal information to: (i) provide you with important information about HealthyWage, including critical updates and notifications; (ii) send you email and/or mobile alerts and/or reminders; (iii) modify your HealthyWage plan to better address your health needs and progress; and (iv) determine appropriate services relevant to you, your lifestyle and your geographic location.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of HealthyWage users or members of the public. Personal information collected on HealthyWage is currently stored and processed in the United States. 

**VI. How We Use De-identified and Aggregated Information and Statistics**  
We may use de-identified and or aggregated information gathered from HealthyWage and related statistics to improve the services provided through HealthyWage, and for certain research and analysis including clinical medical research. We may also provide this information to our partners for such purposes. De-identified information does not include personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or address, but may include gender, height, weight, postal code, and medical information. Aggregated information is information from multiple users that is not associated with any individual user account. 

**VII. Deleting Records**  
You can delete any health and wellness record by signing in to your HealthyWage account and editing a record's profile.

**VIII. Email and Mobile Alerts**  
To comply with your reminder requests and to keep you informed of the latest improvements and alerts relating to your HealthyWage program, HealthyWage will send you emails, reminders and/or mobile alerts. You have the ability to opt out of receiving emails and/or reminders and/or mobile alerts. 

**IX. Enforcement of This Privacy Statement**  
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should contact us at legal@HealthyWage.com. 

**X. Use of Cookies**  
We use cookies to enable you to sign in and to help personalize HealthyWage. A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk. It is not possible to use cookies to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A web server assigns cookies uniquely to you, and only a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation. When you return to the web site, you can retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline some or all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline all cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies. 

**XI. Changes to this Privacy Statement**  
We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of HealthyWage or by sending you a notification directly. We encourage you to review this privacy statement periodically to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of HealthyWage constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on HealthyWage do not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to us in the context of other of our separately operated products or services.
