# Privacy Policy

Data security is a top priority at HealthyWage. This document (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy") presents a summary of the measures we take to ensure that we capture no more participant data than is absolutely necessary to effectively run our programs; that the data we collect is secured in a manner that exceeds industry and regulatory standards; and that we have processes in place to detect and properly handle any security breach, should one ever occur. The Privacy Policy applies to websites owned and operated by HealthyWage LLC, including www.healthywage.com.  
**  
I. Introduction**  
HealthyWage uses incentives, including financial incentives, to empower you to live a better life. In particular, we run healthy weight loss contests, and programs that allow you to get paid to lose weight and even bet on your weight loss. Our programs require only minimal information from participants, as described below, and we safeguard that information very carefully.  
**  
II. User Registration**  
Participants access our system and register for our programs by visiting our website at www.healthywage.com. The first time you sign in to HealthyWage, you will be asked to create an account; whether you do so is your choice. To create an account, you must provide personal information, such as your email address, name, and date of birth. The information collected and stored about each participant is: first name, last name, email address, gender, date of birth, phone number (optional), zip code, weight and height.  
**  
III. Security of Your Personal Information**  
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, all participant data is collected on pages secured by a 128-bit encryption key, and stored in a single MYSQL database that is protected by two layers of authentication, both requiring a case-sensitive, alphanumeric password. The first layer is http authentication. The second layer is http form-based authentication with automatic lock-out after five invalid log-in attempts. The database is also secured by a firewall and an intrusion detection system. The database port on the server is always kept closed (we do not use it). The database resides on a server, with a back-up copy on another server, which are both stored under lock and key in secure, security-patrolled facilities at Rackspace (Rackspace is a high-end, industry-leading server hosting, maintenance and security firm).

All HealthyWage employees and contractors, regardless of their level of access to participant data, are given training on HIPPA compliance and the HealthyWage Privacy Policy and procedures. Each employee and contractor must review and sign the HealthyWage Participant Data Privacy Statement (the “Privacy Statement”) before commencing work. In order to foster an environment where participant privacy is taken very seriously, HealthyWage is clear about its policy that any employee or contractor who behaves in contravention of the Privacy Policy is subject to severe sanctions, including termination.  
**  
IV. Data Access  
**Access to the participant information is on an “only as necessary” basis.  Persons with access to that information are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Please note that if you are participating through your company, then your information may be further segregated, per the terms of our agreement with your company, and may not be accessible to anyone except for designated employees and contractors as required by our agreement with your company.  
**  
V. How We Use Your Personal Information**  
We use personal information collected through HealthyWage, including health and wellness information, to enable the services provided through HealthyWage and as described in this privacy statement. We do not use or disclose your information except as described in this privacy statement. In support of these uses, we may use personal information to: (i) provide you with important information about HealthyWage, including critical updates and notifications; (ii) send you email and/or mobile alerts and/or reminders; (iii) modify your HealthyWage plan to better address your health needs and progress; and (iv) determine appropriate services relevant to you, your lifestyle and your geographic location.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of HealthyWage users or members of the public. If you are participating through a company, then HealthyWage may, at the request of such company, to the extent permitted by federal and state privacy laws and regulations, share participant informtion with the company.

Personal information collected on HealthyWage is currently stored and processed in the United States.

VI. How We Use De-identified and Aggregated Information and Statistics**  
We may use de-identified and or aggregated information gathered from HealthyWage and related statistics to improve the services provided through HealthyWage, and for certain research and analysis including clinical medical research. We may also provide this information to our partners for such purposes. De-identified information does not include personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or address, but may include gender, height, weight, postal code, and medical information. Aggregated information is information from multiple users that is not associated with any individual user account.  Please note that, if you are participating in HealthyWage through a company, the use of your data, even on a de-identified or aggregated basis, may be further restricted or not allowed at all, depending upon our agreement with your company.

X. Use of Cookies**  
We use cookies to enable you to sign in and to help personalize HealthyWage. A cookie is a small text file that a web page server places on your hard disk. It is not possible to use cookies to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A web server assigns cookies uniquely to you, and only a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you can read the cookies.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Using cookies simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation. When you return to the web site, you can retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline some or all cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline all cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies.

We encourage you to review this privacy statement periodically to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of HealthyWage constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on HealthyWage do not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to us in the context of other of our separately operated products or services.
