1\. **Overview**

Choice Media, Inc. ("Choice Media"), a Delaware corporation, is the owner and operator of this web site (the " **Site** ").

This Privacy Policy covers Choice Media's treatment of personally identifiable information (" **Personal Data** ") that Choice Media gathers when its users access and use the Web Site and when they use content and/or services on the Web Site.

Choice Media knows that users care about how their personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.**

If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Choice Media and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

2\. **Information Collected Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data through the Site when you voluntarily chose to provide us with such Personal Data, such as through one or more of the following options:

**Personal Data:**

A. **Registration.** Our Site's registration system requires users to give us various Personal Data, including contact information such as their name, address and e-mail address, and demographic information such as a ZIP code, sex, age or income level. Such contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may also choose (opt-in) to receive future mailings (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below).

B. **Surveys and Questionnaires.** Our online surveys and questionnaires may ask users for contact and demographic information. The user's contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below).

C. **Advertisers.** We display advertisements on our sites that are provided by third parties. In some instances, users may request more information from these third parties concerning their respective products and/or services by clicking on such advertisement. Some of our third party advertisers offer to contact our users directly as a way to follow up a user's interest in its products and/or services. In such cases, users will be asked for their Personal Data, and by providing your Personal Data in such a fashion, a user is consenting to being contacted by such third party.

D. **Contests.** We may run contests on our Site in which we ask users for certain Personal Data, as well as demographic information. The user's contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may choose to receive future mailings (as further explained in the choice/opt-in section below).

**Other Information:**

A. **Demographics.** We receive and store certain types of information whenever users interact with our Site. Choice Media automatically receives and records information on our server logs from users' browser including IP addresses, Choice Media cookie information, and the page requested. 

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Choice Media only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify a user personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users access parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the content. This information may be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregated basis, but it does not indicate the identity of individual users.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While Choice Media will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

B. **IP Addresses.** An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Through the Site, we collect IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct Site analysis. If a user requests pages from the Site, our servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing Personal Data. However, we will use IP addresses to identify any user who refuse to comply with our in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify user who threaten our service, Site, customers, advertisers or others.

C. **Cookies.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Our Site uses cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow us to avoid showing you the same ad or other message repeatedly. Our cookies do not collect or contain Personal Data. They do enable us to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to our Site. Choice Media does not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Data that would reveal the identity of a user, his/her user or screen name or email address. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Site's most attractive features. 

3\. **Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:** We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, will we use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the certain services available through the Site, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Choice Media Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve our services. The Choice Media Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or to have your name deleted from our mailing lists please contact us as indicated below. 

If we intend on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

4\. **Our Disclosure of your Personal Data and Other Information:**

These links to third party web sites are provided only for your convenience, and as such, you access them at your own risk.

6\. **Third Party Ad Services:**

Our Site utilizes certain services of third party service providers to display advertising for our third party advertisers. We do not share Personal Data with these third parties. The services provided by these third parties may in certain instances specifically ask you to provide to them Personal Data such as in response to contests or special offers. Such Personal Data is not provided to the Site and is not subject to this policy. These third party service providers are, however, bound to Choice Media not to collect Personal Data from you in any way other than from your voluntary response to a specific request stating the intended use of the information you provide.

7\. **Exclusions:**

We employ reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under our control. We employ strict security measures to safeguard online transactions; Personal Data is stored in a secured database and always sent via an encrypted Internet channel. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure.
