# HealthyPet's Privacy Policy

**HealthyPetNet™ Privacy Statement** HealthyPetNet™ has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for HealthyPetNet.

HealthyPetNet™ is the best place to shop for Premium dog and cat food, functional horse, cat and dog treats, pet care products and supplements. We stand behind our products and guarantee your satisfaction with every order.  


**Security**

Your credit card is safe with HealthyPetNet™ .

Every time you shop with HealthyPetNet™ at www.HealthyPetNet.com, you are backed by a security guarantee. When you shop with us, you are shopping on our secure server, which encrypts all of your personal information, including name, address and credit card number, login name and password. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use your personal information. Our 128 bit encryption is implemented with a secure certificate. 

**We guarantee your privacy**

At HealthyPetNet™, we are committed to protecting your privacy. HealthyPetNet™ does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to other companies. It may be helpful for you to know how we use the information we collect:

We collect and aggregate non personally identifiable information about shoppers browsing our site. We collect information such as your IP address, web browser type and operating system to enable us to provide shoppers with an enhanced shopping experience.

**Customers**

Our ordering process requires customers to give us contact information (such as name, address, email address and phone number), which we use to ship product orders and to contact the customer if necessary. As a direct sales company, our organization is based on our Independent Distributors, who own their own websites. Therefore, customers who register with us and do not have a Distributor will be assigned one. HealthyPetNet™ will pass along the customer's contact information (Name, mailing address, phone number and email address) and order information (Item, Quantity and Price) to their Distributor. HealthyPetNet™ does NOT pass any financial information along to the sponsoring Distributor.

**Field Representatives (Distributors)**

Our Field Representative registration form requires Field Representatives to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and unique identifiers such as social security number or Tax ID number. Contact information is used to ship product orders and keep Field Representatives informed of company news and promotions. Unique identifiers are for tax purposes and for use in our record system. A Field representative is assigned a HealthyPetNet™ ID number that is independent of his or her social security/Tax ID number and is used for verification of identity. If you are a Field Representative with a Replicated Home Page, HealthyPetNet™ may assign you customers who purchase over the HealthyPetNet™ website and who do not have an assigned Field Representative.

**What Information is being shared**

We may need to share information with other companies during the course of business. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information for any secondary purposes. 

**Email**

We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to help us improve the site, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit permission.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**

There are two types of communications we send to our customers: essential and non-essential. Essential communications include but are not limited to order confirmation emails, emails containing tracking information for orders that have been shipped and autoship reminder emails.

Non-essential emails include but are not limited to product announcements and general company information.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We may disclose personal information when required to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
