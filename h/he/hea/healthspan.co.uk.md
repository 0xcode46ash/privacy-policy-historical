**Customer charter**

Healthspan understands that many customers value their personal privacy and wish to ensure that any company who provides a service to them will also value their privacy. We therefore guarantee that we will not sell or pass your data to a third party outside the Healthspan Group, in the normal course of business, unless that third party requires the data to provide you with your order or in the course of communicating with you as a customer. As part of our customer charter we will process your personal data fairly and lawfully.

**Data that we collect**

To enable us to process your order we will ask you to provide personal details such as:

Name   
Email address  
Password  
Address  
Payment details

**IP Addresses and Cookies**

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. This information is collected for our internal purposes only and shall not be disclosed to any other organisation except as required by law. We may use "cookies" to collect this information and track your use of this website. For more information about "cookies", please see the Interactive Advertising Bureau's website: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). If you do not agree you can choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before you accept a cookie.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

**How we use your data**

Our primary purpose in using your data is to provide you with your order. We may analyse your data (or provide your data to agents who are contracted to supply services to us) to create a data profile to enable us to provide a better service to you.

We will keep all your personal information provided by you confidential except that we may use personal information for any of the following purposes:

  * Administration, general correspondence, support, profiling and processing (including personalising the Site for your use); 
  * Contacting you to register your use of the Site, to advise you of any special offers, to notify you of new features or to resolve any queries you or we may have regarding us or the Site or its use; 
  * Responding to any requests or queries from you; 
  * Profiling you and the users of the Site; 
  * Contacting you to notify you of other services or products that might be of interest to you (although you can elect not to receive any of these at any time by contacting us as set out below); and 
  * Subscribing you to our newsletters or email alerts or online surveys (although you can unsubscribe from these at any time by contacting us as set out below) 



**Third-Party Web Beacons**

****We use third-party web beacons from Google to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Google may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Google,[click here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).  


**Your consent to processing data**  


By Law we are required to obtain your consent to processing your data. We will assume that you have given your consent to the uses outlined above if you provide us with any data via our web sites or via replies to advertisements. You can advise us that you wish to withdraw your consent by sending us an email explaining the situation to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).  


Where we process or transfer your data outside of what is outlined in "How we use your data" we will ask you to provide your specific consent.

**How we protect your data**

**The data that you have provided will remain in databases that are established in a network that is firewall protected. Firewalls exist to stop the transfer of unauthorised information to or from the network. Physical access to our servers is restricted through the use of door code security systems. Higher level user login ID and password controls are also in place to restrict access. Only a limited number of IT personnel are authorised by the IT director to access the database. We use industry standard security technology and server certification.**

As a routine we carry out validation checks to help prevent fraud. No protection system is foolproof and the company cannot guarantee the total security of data or accept any liability unless a breach of security was due to our proven wilful default or negligence. Certain web sites linked to our site may not offer the same protections as the Healthspan site and the laws of some countries outside the Channel Islands or the EU to which your data may be transferred as part of the process of providing products and services to you, may not offer the same data protection.

**Customer choice**

You can update your data or ask us to delete your data at anytime by sending an E-mail to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).

We promise to try to delete or update your information promptly.

**Customer charter**

Healthspan operates a no quibble refund policy on all our products. We also guarantee that we will not sell or pass your data to a third party outside the Group, in the normal course of business, unless that third party requires the data to fulfill your order.

**Healthspan Web Site- terms of usage**

Healthspan aims to provide up to date and accurate information on its web site. However there can be no guarantee as to the accuracy of the information on the site.

By becoming a registered user and using the Site you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy. This Policy sets out how we intend to collect and use any personal information on this Site. "Personal information" as used in this Policy means information relating to you as an individual such as name, address and contact details. By becoming a registered user or using this Site you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy and consenting to the processing of personal information as described in this Policy; if you do not agree with any of these terms you should not become a registered user and should cease using the Site immediately. We will assume that you accept our privacy policy if you use this site. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by amending the site content.

Your data or information generated from the usage of our site may be transferred, sold or assigned to another third party as the result of a sale, transfer of business, merger, reorganisation, liquidation or change in control of the Healthspan Group of companies.

The name Healthspan referred to in this privacy policy should be read as referring to legal entity companies which are subsidiaries or sub-subsidiaries of Healthspan Group Limited, through which trading is conducted or services are supplied.
