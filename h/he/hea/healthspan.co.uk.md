# Privacy Policy

**Customer charter**

Healthspan understands that many customers value their personal privacy and wish to ensure that any company who provides a service to them will also value their privacy. We therefore guarantee that we will not sell or pass your data to a third party outside the Healthspan Group, in the normal course of business, unless that third party requires the data to provide you with your order for delivery or in the course of communicating with you as a customer. As part of our customer charter we will process your personal data fairly and lawfully.

**Data that we collect**

To enable us to process your order we will ask you to provide personal details such as:

Name   
Email address  
Password  
Address  
Payment details

No Credit Card numbers are held on our Sites or on the associated back-office systems used by us to process your orders.  For future reference to help us communicate with you, the first few and/or last digits only of your Credit Card number are kept by us. 

For any repeat orders of Products made by you via our Sites, our Credit Card Agency securely holds your Credit Card details and provides us with a unique token that represents that particular card; this token is only valid for payment to us and this data is therefore worthless to any potential website hacker.

**IP Addresses and Cookies**

Healthspan Limited ("Healthspan", "we" or "us") uses cookies on its websites at ([www.healthspan.co.uk](http://www.healthspan.co.uk/) and [www.healthspanelite.co.uk](http://www.healthspanelite.co.uk/)) (the “Site” or “Sites”)  to collect information about your browsing and shopping behavior. We use two types of cookies on the Sites. By using the Sites you consent to us using the cookies described below.

**First Party Cookies**

First party cookies are used on the Sites to gather information about your use of onsite content and to enable us to customize your user experience. Cookies help us log you back into the Sites as a returning customer and also help us to remember your browsing history, Product and information preferences. We use cookies to enable you to add Products to your shopping basket. We also use cookies to collect information about your computer's IP address, operating system and browser type. This information helps us to provide you with the most up-to-date browsing experience possible. Lastly, we use first party cookies to help us balance our servers. This allows us to deliver quick page load times for our customers.

Healthspan’s first party cookies contain no personally identifiable information. All personally identifiable Information on browsing, preference and purchase history, is stored in our secure website data base. This information is collected for our internal purposes only and shall not be disclosed to any other organization except as required by law.

**Third Party Cookies**

Third party cookies are cookies that pass on information on browsing and purchase activity to third party service providers. All third party data gathered by Healthspan’s third party cookies is statistical information and does not personally identify any individuals.

Healthspan primarily uses third party cookies to help us conduct website tracking and monitoring to ensure we provide our customers with the best possible shopping and web experience. We use the web analytics platform provided by Google called Google Analytics. You can read more about Google Analytics [here](http://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55591).

We will also intermittently use third party cookies to gather behavioural, browsing and demographic data. This information is used by third party partners to deliver marketing and advertising activities. This information is aggregated and contains no personally identifiable information.

**Blocking Cookies**

If you do not agree you can choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before you accept a cookie.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our Sites. Please note that if you refuse to accept certain cookies, some of the functions on the Healthspan Sites such as adding a Product to a basket may not work.

By agreeing to these terms and conditions you are accepting the use of first and third party cookies on and by the Healthspan websites.

**How we use your data**

Our primary purpose in using your data is to provide you with your order. We may analyze your data (or provide your data to agents who are contracted to supply services to us) to create a data profile to enable us to provide a better service to you.

We will keep all your personal information provided by you confidential except that we may use personal information for any of the following purposes:

  * administration, general correspondence, support, profiling and processing (including personalising the Sites for your use); 
  * contacting you to register your use of the Sites, to advise you of any special offers, to notify you of new features or to resolve any queries you or we may have regarding us or the Sites or their use; 
  * responding to any requests or queries from you; 
  * profiling you and the users of the Sites; 
  * contacting you to notify you of other services or Products that might be of interest to you (although you can elect not to receive any of these at any time by contacting us as set out below); 
  * subscribing you to our newsletters or email alerts or online surveys (although you can unsubscribe from these at any time by contacting us as set out below); and
  * Responding to any requests from the police and local government law enforcements agencies.



**Checkout assistance service**

When you use our Sites, details of any Products that you seek to purchase and your email address may be collected as you fill in the checkout form. If you do not complete your purchase, we may contact you using a third party with these details to offer our assistance (in case, for instance, you were suffering from technical difficulties). This is an optional service. You can choose not to receive our checkout assistance emails at any time by following the link at the bottom of each assistance email.

**Your consent to processing data**

By Law, we are required to obtain your consent to processing your data. We will assume that you have given your consent to the uses outlined above if you provide us with any data via our websites or via replies to advertisements. You can advise us that you wish to withdraw your consent by sending us an email explaining the situation to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).

Where we process or transfer your data outside of what is outlined in "How we use your data" we will ask you to provide your specific consent.

**How we protect your data**

The data that you have provided will remain in databases that are established in a network that is firewall protected. Firewalls exist to stop the transfer of unauthorised information to or from the network. Physical access to our servers is restricted through the use of door code security systems. Higher level user login ID and password controls are also in place to restrict access. Only a limited number of IT personnel are authorised by the IT director to access the database. We use industry standard security technology and server certification.

As a routine we carry out validation checks to help prevent fraud. No protection system is foolproof and the company cannot guarantee the total security of data or accept any liability unless a breach of security was due to our proven willful default or negligence. Certain websites linked to our Sites may not offer the same protections as the Healthspan Sites and the laws of some countries outside the Channel Islands or the EU to which your data may be transferred as part of the process of providing Products and services to you, may not offer the same data protection.

**Customer choice**

You can update your data or ask us to delete your data anytime by sending an E-mail to [info@healthspan.co.uk](mailto:info@healthspan.co.uk).

We promise to try to delete or update your information promptly.
