## Privacy Statement

Consistent with Victorian Government policy and legislation, the Department of Human Services endorses fair information handling practices. Any information provided, including identification of individuals, will be used only for the purpose intended and where the intention includes confidentiality, information will be treated as such unless otherwise required by law.

Visitor logs are used on this site for statistical purposes only. No attempt will be made to identify specific users or their browsing activity. De-identified data from these logs may be used to update and improve the Department of Human Services site.

Email addresses provided via this site will only be used to respond to specific user queries and will not be added to any mailing lists, nor disclosed to any other party without users' knowledge and consent, unless required by law.

This web site may use cookies for certain services. A cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user's browser. Cookies can provide various types of information, depending on how they are used. This may include information about a user's identity and web site visiting patterns and preferences. Users may set their browser to identify the presence of cookies and to give them the option of accepting or rejecting them.

Pages on the site may be coded with Nielsen//NetRatings software. This is transparent to the user, as the software makes use of an invisible image at the bottom of the web page. This software stores a cookie in your browser, which contains a unique identifier, and sends information to Nielsen//NetRatings. This enables Nielsen//NetRatings to track the number of unique visitors to the site. In no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. We do not and will not marry any data collected by Nielsen//NetRatings with any personal information.
