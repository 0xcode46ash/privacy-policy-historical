# Privacy Policy [US]

HEAD has prepared this Privacy Policy Statement to inform you of the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website and to describe how HEAD protects and utilizes information it receives from Website visitors.

**Information Collection and Use**

HEAD respects the privacy rights of Website visitors. HEAD collects personal information concerning Website visitors only in connection with product orders, contests or sweepstakes, consumer surveys, product warranty registrations, site membership registrations or submitting emails to HEAD. Such personal information may include your name, address, date of birth, email address, daytime phone number, credit card information or other information.

You agree that HEAD may use the information that it collects from you when you participate in any of the above noted events for one or more of the following purposes:

  * To fulfill a product order
  * To administer a contest, survey or promotional offer;
  * To reply to a visitor’s email;
  * To respond to a customer service request;
  * To send information by email to registered site members;
  * To fulfill contest prizes or promotional offers; and
  * To track or verify compliance with HEAD policies as well as federal, state or local laws.



When HEAD intends to use your personal information other than in administering your account or warranty-related purposes, HEAD will inform you of this at the time that the personal information is requested and provide you an opportunity to opt out of such usage. For example, if you win a prize in a HEAD contest, HEAD may want to post your name on the Website but will give you the opportunity to opt out.

**Links and Information Gathered by Others**

You should be aware that when you are on the Website, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond HEAD’s control. There are links to other sites from the Website that take you outside our service. These other sites may collect data or solicit personal information from you. HEAD is not responsible for any information that you choose to provide on another website.

**Sharing**

We do not sell or otherwise share with outside parties your personal information unless we provide you with advance notice. “Outside parties” do not include affiliated companies of HEAD, HEAD’s Website hosting partner or other parties who conduct HEAD’s business as long as those parties agree to keep all such information confidential.

**Cookies and Do Not Track Headers**

The Website, as do most major web sites, uses “cookies.” Cookies are small bits of information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes while on the website. Cookies facilitate your “web surfing” by saving your passwords, purchases and preferences based on your previous activity on a website. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose to refuse all cookies. You do this through your browser. However, if you choose to refuse cookies, some areas of the Website will not function properly. Note that our Website may not recognize or respond to Do Not Track headers from web browsers.

**Updates**

If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time the personal information is collected, we will notify you by email. You will then have the choice whether or not we may use your personal information in this different manner. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a notice on the Website informing users of the change. Any changes in policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the change.

**Children’s Privacy**

Our Website is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Please contact us immediately using the information below if you believe we may have collected information from your child so that we can remove such information from our files.

**Security**

We take what we deem to be appropriate physical, organizational and technical security measures to protect your personal data from loss or theft as well as from unauthorized access, transfer, reproduction, use or modification. When you enter sensitive or personally-identifying information on our Website, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission is 100% secure and while we use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Contact**

If you have inquiries or complaints and/or other questions relating to the processing of personal data, please feel free to send us a letter to HEAD Penn Racquet Sports, Attention of: Customer service, 306 South 45th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ, 85043, USA or an e-mail to the following address [askus@us.head.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20160524194836id_/http://shop-us.head.com/us/%E2%80%9Dmailto:askus@us.head.com%E2%80%9D).

This Privacy Policy Statement pertains only to personal information collected through the Website and not to information collected by other means.
