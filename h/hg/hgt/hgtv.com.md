Aside from an automatic reply to an e-mail received by us, it is our intent not to e-mail to you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There may be instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but after an initial mailing gauging your interest this will be continued only with your permission and consent. 

Third-Party advertising companies such as DoubleClick Inc. utilize certain technologies to deliver specific advertisements, which appear on pages throughout this website, to the site's users.
