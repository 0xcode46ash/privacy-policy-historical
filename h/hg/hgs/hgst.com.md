Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.  
We may share your personal information within Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.  
Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries Hitachi Global Storage Technologies will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

Use of Suppliers 

In some cases Hitachi Global Storage Technologies uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' policies.

Mergers and Acquisitions 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Hitachi Global Storage Technologiesâ€™practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies 

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Hitachi Global Storage Technologies or others on Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.  
Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed to help us understand trends and patterns. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.  
We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Hitachi Global Storage Technologies pages use cookies, sent by Hitachi Global Storage Technologies or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.  
Some Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.  
If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.

  
Service Quality Monitoring 

Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is Hitachi Global Storage Technologies general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.

Online Advertising 

Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After it is collected the information is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual. If, however, you would prefer that these companies not collect such information, please visit www.networkadvertising.org and follow the "opt-out" instructions.

Personalized URL Link 

On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.  
If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let Hitachi Global Storage Technologies collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.  
Disclosures Required By Law Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
