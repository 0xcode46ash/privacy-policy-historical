# H&R Block Online Privacy Policy

**H &R Block Privacy Statement for Online Services**

H&R Block was founded on principles of trust, integrity and the delivery of outstanding products and services. For over 45 years, H&R Block affiliates have been committed to customer satisfaction and have maintained the privacy our customers expect. We are proud to say that we will treat your online account information in a similar manner.

The following privacy statement sets forth the types of information we collect from you and how we may use or disclose that information from time to time. 

**Information We Collect**

We may collect the following information about you, either directly or through persons or entities acting on our behalf:

  * information we receive from your transactions with us, our affiliates and their franchisees, such as information you submit on or in connection with your tax return. 
  * information you provide to us to on applications, forms, online registrations, product registration cards, surveys, and in connection with polls or contests, such as your name, address and e-mail address.
  * credit or debit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase goods or services on or through our site. 
  * information when you visit our Website, such as navigation patterns at the site on an aggregate basis and information we collect through Internet cookies or clear gifs, such as time spent on our Website and which pages are visited. Internet cookies allow us to customize our Website for you based upon information you provide to us, such as by displaying only those items that may be of interest to you or making it easier for you to access your account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally and is only used, for example, to help us understand which features of our Website are most popular with our clients. 



**Limitations on Information Sharing**

With your prior consent, we may use any information we obtain in order to prepare your tax return and disclose it to H&R Block affiliates so that you can receive selective information regarding any of the financial services offered by H&R Block affiliates, such as mortgages, investments, banking services, legal plans, insurance and financial planning. 

We may disclose any information we collect, as described above, to service providers to perform a service for us or perform a function on our behalf, or financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Examples could include companies that process contest entry forms, collate letters, manage information through Internet cookies or other technologies, or companies that send e-mails on our behalf. In cases where we use service providers, we restrict such service providers from using your nonpublic personal information except to act on our behalf or as required or permitted by law.

We may make other disclosures of any information we collect, as described above, to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties as required or permitted by law. Such disclosures may include, without limitation, disclosures such as those to effect or process electronic refund advance loans or other products or services that you request that are provided by a business partner of H&R Block, to our franchisees to effect a product or service you have requested, process credit card transactions, to permit auditing of account information, to comply with a subpoena or other court or government agency order, or in the event of a sale or transfer of our business or assets. 

Except for residents of Vermont, if you come directly from a third party Web site promoting the H&R Block Web site, we may share your e-mail address with such third party Web site that you have prompted to link you to the H&R Block Web site. For example, if you are a member of XYZ.COM Website and you click on a promotion for H&R Block at the XYZ.COM Website, we may confirm your email address with XYZ.COM. We also may collect and disclose information in connection with your license and registration of our desktop software, such as Kiplinger's WILLPower, Home and Business Attorney and TaxCut, as provided in our software privacy policy located at http://www.taxcut.com/privacy.html. For Vermont residents, we will not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties (other than as permitted by law) unless you authorize us to make that disclosure. Your authorization must be in writing or, if you agree, in electronic form. If you wish to authorize us to disclose your nonpublic personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties, you may call us at 1-800-HRBLOCK (ask for client relations) or visit the following Web page: [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/customer_support/index.html).

We treat information about our former customers in the same manner as information of existing customers. 

**If You Do Not Want Us to Share your E-Mail Address with Third Parties (Not Applicable to Vermont Residents).**

If you don't want us to share your e-mail address with third party Web sites, as set forth above, please call 1-800-HRBLOCK (ask for client relations) or visit the following Web page: [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/customer_support/index.html).

**If You Do Not Want to Receive Promotions from H &R Block.** If at any time you wish to stop receiving promotional offers from H&R Block, you may call the following toll-free number: 1-800-HRBLOCK (ask for client relations) or visit the following Web page: [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/customer_support/index.html). We may, however, continue to provide you with tax information, additional tax return preparation services, and other information about your accounts and transactions with H&R Block and its affiliates.

**Protection of Nonpublic Personal Information**

The use of, and access to, nonpublic personal information by H&R Block companies is restricted to those employees who need to know that information to provide products, services or support to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

**Update your information or provide feedback:** Should your personal account information change or you would like to modify it in any way, or if you have a question or comment concerning this privacy policy, please call 1-800-HRBLOCK (472-5625) or visit our customer feedback page at [Submit a Question](https://web.archive.org/customer_support/submit_a_question.jsp).
