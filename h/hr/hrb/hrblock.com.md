**Information We Collect**

When you visit www.hrblock.com, we may collect information about you from the following categories and sources: 

  * Information we receive when you request services, or information from us or companies with whom we have business relationships, enter contests or sweepstakes, or complete surveys or polls, such as your name, address, e-mail address and payment or billing information. 
  * Information to prepare your tax return or for other financial products and services. The collection of this information is governed by the specific privacy policy for the H&R Block business providing these services to you. 
  * Information you provide when you apply for employment with H&R Block or any of its affiliates. 
  * Web technologies. We may collect information through the following Web technologies: We utilize a software technology called "cookies". Internet cookies allow us to customize our Website for you by placing small files on your computer as you visit various components of hrblock.com. Through the use of cookies, we can display only those items that may be of interest to you on a particular site, or make it easier for you to access your account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally. 

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear gifs and cookies are not tied to user's personally identifiable information. 

Like most standard Web site servers, H&R Block uses log files. Information collected in log files may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not personally identifiable. When you use certain online tax services, IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable users to file or transmit tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service. For more information on these technologies - specific to your use of this web site - please click [Privacy Technology Definitions](https://web.archive.org/universal/privacy_technology_definitions.html) for a discussion of these terms. 




The third party service provider we currently use to manage these technologies is Omniture. For more information about the practices of this company or to decline cookies from this third-party ad server you may visit their Web site directly at <http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product>. In addition, that site also provides information about their privacy policy and opt-out procedure. We may engage different providers to provide similar services from time to time. 

  * When you use calculators and other tools on our Web sites that do not require registration, H&R Block may collect non-identifiable data from such tools, such as the number of people that use a certain tool. H&R Block may also set cookies or clear gifs based upon your use of tools and calculators to help us customize offers and tools to your particular interests. H&R Block will not record or track any data you enter into standalone tools and calculators in any way that identifies you personally, unless we specifically inform you that we are doing so at the time you provide such data. 
  * When you use our office locator service, we may collect data such as address or zip code information you provide so that we can better assess the level of interest in our services in a particular area, and the effectiveness of the locator tool at helping clients actually use our services.
