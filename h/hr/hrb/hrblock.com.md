TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the H&R Block Web site and does not cover information you provide in connection with transactions with H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc., H&R Block Mortgage Corporation, other H&R Block affiliates or information that may be collected through H&R Block software, such as TaxCut® or H&R Block DeductionPro software.

Information We Collect

We may collect information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive when you: request services or information from us or from companies with whom we have business relationships with, enter contests or sweepstakes, or complete surveys or polls. Such information may include your name, address and e-mail address. 
  * Information we receive when you enroll in an H&R Block tax training course, such as your name, address, and payment or billing information. 
  * Information you provide when you apply for employment with H&R Block or any of its affiliates.
  * Web technologies. We may collect information through the following Web technologies: 

We utilize a software technology called "cookies". Internet cookies allow us to customize our Website for you. Through the use of cookies we can, for example, display only those items that may be of interest to you, or make it easier to access such things as account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally.

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. 

Like most standard Web site servers, H&R Block use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable users to file or transmit tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service. 

  * From time to time, H&R Block may offer online chats on its Web site. If you participate in these public chats, you are not required to provide any personally identifying information to H&R Block, and we recommend that you do not provide such information. During these tax chats, we may log the questions asked by users and the answers provided by H&R Block. These sessions may be archived and reposted on the H&R Block Web site at a later time. 
  * When you use calculators and other tools on our Web sites that do not require registration, H&R Block may collect non-identifiable data from such tools, such as the number of people that use a certain tool. H&R Block will also set cookies or clear gifs based upon your use of tools and calculators to help us customize offers and tools to your particular interests. H&R Block will not record or track any data you enter into standalone tools and calculators in any way that identifies you personally, unless we specifically inform you that we are doing so at the time you provide such data. 
  * When you use our office locator service, we do not collect any personally identifying information about you, and the address or zip code information you provide is not stored or retained by H&R Block. 



H&R Block may disclose information it collects as permitted or required by law. Without limitation, H&R Block may disclose information it collects as follows:

  * **Affiliates.** H&R Block may provide information it collects to its affiliates. We disclose information to our affiliates in order to respond to your requests, to help limit your receipt of marketing materials you do not wish to receive, or to customize offers or promotions to your interests. 
  * **Service Providers.** H&R Block may disclose information to a service provider in order to perform a service for H&R Block or perform a function on our behalf. Examples could include sweepstakes administrators that help us manage contests and sweepstakes we offer, or companies that manage our electronic mail for us. Service providers may use information you provide as indicated at the time you provide such information.
  * **Joint Marketing Agreements.** H&R Block may provide information it collects to joint marketers with whom H&R Block has a marketing arrangement. For example, H&R Block may enter into agreements with airlines or credit card companies to provide you with "miles" or "points" for visiting the H&R Block Web site or purchasing certain products or services from H&R Block. In such case, H&R Block would provide identifying information about you to the company in order to credit your account with such "miles" or "points". The joint marketer may use your information for other purposes.
  * **Franchisees.** If you request services in an area served by an H&R Block franchise, or if you enroll in a tax course provided by an H&R Block franchise, H&R Block may disclose your service request or enrollment information to such franchisee. 
  * **Sale or Transfer of Business.** If H&R Block sells or transfers any of its business or assets, certain information about our clients may be a part of that sale or transfer. In the event of such a sale or transfer, H&R Block will notify you as set forth below.
  * **Legal Purposes.** Though we make efforts to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, or wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on H&R Block.



We may disclose aggregate information compiled using your personal information that does not identify you individually or personally. This may include, for example, the total number of clients H&R Block served in a particular state or city, or the number of total clients, or the average age of a user of our Web sites.

Links to Other Web sites

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that H&R Block is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. In certain cases, H&R Block may co-brand or frame certain web pages or allow third parties to co-brand or frame certain pages of our site. In cases where non-public personal information you provide on, or in connection with transactions at, the H&R Block Web site will be subject to a third party privacy policy, H&R Block will notify you that the information you provide will be subject to such third party privacy policy. H&R Block may notify you by posting a copy of the third party privacy policy at the location where you enter personal information. 

Protection of Personal Information

The use of, and access to, nonpublic personal information by H&R Block companies is restricted to those employees who need to know that information to provide products, services or support to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Changes to Our Privacy Statement

If we make a material change to this Privacy Statement, including a material change in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by using one of the following methods at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such change: (1) we will post a notice on our Web site describing the change; or (2) we will send you electronic mail notifying you of the change. You may also have additional rights under state or federal law in the event of a change in our Privacy Statement.

If H&R Block were to sell its assets to a third party, certain personal information of our customers could be part of the assets sold or transferred. In the case where H&R Block transfers or sells its assets, including your personal information, to a non-affiliated third party, H&R Block will notify you of the transfer or sale. The notification procedure will be the same as the procedure we use to notify you of a change in our privacy statement.

**Update your information or provide feedback:** Should your personal account information change or if you would like to modify it in any way, please call 816-504-1599.

**If You Want to Limit Receiving Promotions from H &R Block**. If at any time you wish to limit your receipt of promotional offers from H&R Block based upon information you provide in connection with your use of H&R Block online tax services, you may call the following number: 816-504-1599 and ask for client relations. We may, however, continue to provide you with tax or financial information, legal notices, and other information about your accounts and transactions with H&R Block and its affiliates. This paragraph only applies to contact information H&R Block obtains through this Web site, so you could still receive offers where H&R Block obtain your contact information through other sources.
