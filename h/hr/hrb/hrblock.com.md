# H&R Block Online Privacy Policy

**H &R BLOCK PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR ONLINE TAX SERVICES**

H&R Block was founded on principles of trust, integrity and the delivery of outstanding products and services. For over 45 years, H&R Block and its affiliates have been committed to customer satisfaction and have maintained the privacy our customers expect. We are proud to say that we will treat your online account information in a similar manner.

The following privacy statement sets forth the types of information we collect from you and how we may use or disclose that information from time to time.

**Information We Collect**  
We may collect personal information about you as follows:

  * information we receive from your transactions with us, our affiliates and their franchisees.

  * information you provide to us on applications, forms, product registration cards, surveys, and in connection with polls or contests, such as your name, address and e-mail address.

  * credit or debit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase goods or services on our site.

  * information from your use of our Web site, such as navigation patterns at the site on an aggregate basis and information we collect through Internet cookies.




**Limitations on Information Sharing.**  
With your prior consent, we may use any information we obtain in preparing your tax return and disclose it to H&R Block affiliates so that you can receive selective information regarding any of the financial services offered by H&R Block affiliates, such as mortgages, investments, banking, legal plans, insurance and financial planning.

We may disclose any information we collect, as described above, to service providers to perform a service for us or perform a function on our behalf. Examples include processing contest entry forms, collating letters or sending e-mails on our behalf. In cases where we use service providers, we restrict such service providers from using your personal information except to act on our behalf. 

We may make other disclosures of any information we collect, as described above, to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties as required or permitted by law. Such disclosures may include, without limitation, disclosures such as those to effect or process electronic refund advance loans or other products or services that you request, to our franchisees to effect a product or service you have requested, process credit card transactions, to permit auditing of account information, to comply with a subpoena or other court or government agency order, or in the event of a sale or transfer of our business or assets. 

If you come directly from a third party Web site promoting the H&R Block Web site, we may share your e-mail address with such third party Web site that you have prompted to link you to the H&R Block Web site. For example, if you are a member of XYZ.COM Web site and you click on a promotion for H&R Block at the XYZ.COM Web site, we may confirm your email address with XYZ.COM. We also disclose information in connection with your license and registration of our desktop software, such as Kiplinger's WILLPower, Home and Business Attorney and TaxCut, as provided in our software privacy policy located at <http://www.taxcut.com/privacy.html>.

We treat information about our former customers in the same manner as information of existing customers.

**If You Do Not Want Us to Share your E-Mail Address with Third Parties.**  
If you don't want us to share your e-mail address with third party Web sites, as set forth above, please call 1-800-HRBLOCK (ask for client relations) or visit the following Web page: [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/customer_support/index.html).

**Protection of Nonpublic Personal Information**  
The use of, and access to, nonpublic personal information by H&R Block companies is restricted to those employees who need to know that information to provide products, services or support to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
