NOTE: The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site and online tax program, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this web site.

We May Collect the Following Types of Information About You.

  * We may collect personal information when you prepare or electronically file your tax return using our Web-based or software-based tax programs and services. This information, referred to in this policy as "tax return information," includes, for example, your name, address and certain other data such as your social security number, income and deductions data, and other information about you and your dependents that you provide to prepare or file your tax return. 
  * We may collect information in connection with transactions you complete or propose to complete with us, our affiliates or their franchisees. This information may include, for example, your name, address and certain other "nonpublic personal information" such as checking, debit and credit account numbers, balances and payment history, income, assets, and social security number. This information may also include system information, such as your operating system version, internet protocol (IP) address and the number of times you electronically file using the software and the Web site from which your tax return preparation originated. The Internal Revenue Service("IRS") requires us to collect certain system information in connection with electronic filing. 
  * We may collect information about you from the IRS and other third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, in connection with tax preparation or other services you complete or propose to complete with us, our affiliates, or non-affiliated third parties. This could include, for example, information about the status of your tax return, tax refund, electronic payment of tax preparation or e-filing fees, or tax return related loans. 
  * We, our affiliates, or non-affiliated third party service providers with whom we have business relationships may collect information about you when you inquire about services or request information from us, or when you enter our contests, submit rebate forms, seek technical support, register your software or create an account on our Web site. This information may include, for example, your name, telephone number, mailing address and e-mail address, system information and configuration, account number and demographic information. 
  * We collect other information about you and your use of our services through the use of various technologies to help manage our Web sites, to save our customers time, and to understand more about the way our customers interact with us. These technologies include cookies, clear GIFs and log files. Because the operation of these technologies is not visible to users, we believe in being open and upfront about the way we use these technologies and their purposes. 
    * **Internet Cookies.** A "cookie" is a term for alphanumeric identifiers that a Web server transfers to your computer via your Web browser. When your Internet browser visits a Web page, a cookie is set with a unique, anonymous number. This number is recorded in a small text file that is transmitted to your computer and stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive. Then, when you visit each Web page on which the cookie technology is enabled, the Web site can recognize your browser as a unique, anonymous user. Some common purposes of cookies are to enhance the usability of our Web site, to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad or message over and over again, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page. Cookies are also used for ad reporting functions such as to learn which ads are bringing users to our Web site. This can help us tailor our ads and enhance our websites for your needs. Unless you consent we do not collect personally identifiable information from you through the use of cookies. 
    * **Clear GIFS.** We also employ a software technology called a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), also known as a pixel tag or Web beacon. A clear GIF is a line of code that we place on our Websites or in e-mails which allows us to analyze our advertising and the general usage patterns of visitors to our Web sites. These help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content or promotions are effective. Unless you consent we do not collect personally identifiable information from you through the use of clear GIFS. 
    * **Log Files.** Like most standard Web site servers, H&R Block DTS uses log files. Log files track Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track Web site navigation in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

The third party services we use to manage these technologies include DoubleClick and WebTrends on Demand. For more information about the practices of these companies or to decline cookies from these third-party ad servers you may visit their Web sites directly at   
<http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy> or   
<https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp>   
In addition, the aforementioned sites also provide information about their respective privacy policies and opt-out procedures. You may also adjust your Internet browser settings to decline cookies placed directly by H&R Block DTS; however, this will impair your ability to use the H&R Block DTS tax preparation Web site and services. 

  * The IRS requires H&R Block DTS to retain filed tax returns for a period of at least three years. It is H&R Block DTS' policy that if you start, but do not complete a tax return in our online tax programs, we will generally keep the tax return information you provide until the end of the tax season. 



How We May Disclose Your Information.

H&R Block DTS' disclosure of your information is controlled by Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999, certain other laws, and H&R Block DTS policies. The information we collect as described above may be disclosed as set forth below. 

Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that we have your consent ("opt in") before we disclose your tax return information to affiliates or third parties except the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and law enforcement officials, and except for certain other lawful purposes. Some information that is identical to some of your tax return information, such as name and address, may not be subject to Section 7216 if we also collect this information for purposes other than filing your tax return. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires us to give you the option to limit the sharing of certain creditworthiness information with our affiliates. Such information includes that which is used, expected to be used, or collected for the purpose of establishing your eligibility for consumer credit, insurance and related products and services, and is not related solely to your transactions or other communications with us. You may direct that this information not be disclosed to H&R Block DTS affiliates by declining to sign the Section 7216 consent described above. 

We may disclose your information as described below where you have provided consent under Section 7216, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law. 

  * We may disclose your information to H&R Block DTS affiliates engaged in banking, investment, insurance or other financial services activities in order to provide you with service enhancements and product opportunities that we believe may interest you. 
  * We may disclose your information to service providers who perform business functions on our behalf or to financial institutions for joint marketing. Services such organizations could perform on our behalf may include, for example, check printing, data processing and analysis, contest supervision, and surface or e-mail production. We require all H&R Block DTS service providers and financial institutions to have written contracts with us that specify appropriate use of your information, require them to take steps to safeguard your data, and prohibit them from making unauthorized or unlawful use of your information. If a state law requires us to give you the right to opt-out prior to any disclosure of your personal information for joint marketing, we will not disclose your information for such purposes without your consent. 
  * We may disclose your information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties for other purposes permitted or required by law. Such purposes may include, for example, processing or fulfilling a service you request, or selling or transferring our business or assets. We may also make your tax return information accessible to our H&R Block tax preparation affiliates and franchisees so that if you request additional tax preparation services from our affiliates or franchisees, they will be able to access your information. 
  * If you elect to receive a Refund Anticipation Loan (Electronic Refund Advance loan), a revolving loan to pay your tax liability, or if you elect to pay your tax preparation or electronic filing fees from your tax refund, you will be presented with a loan application and agreement and/or refund processing agreement. By accepting these agreements, you are authorizing H&R Block DTS to disclose your tax return information to the lending bank. You should review these agreements and the privacy policies of the lending bank to understand how it may use and disclose your personal information. 
  * The IRS requires that we disclose certain information to it in connection with your electronic filing of a tax return. This information may include your internet protocol (IP) address. 
  * We may disclose your information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law. This may occur in connection with a court order, subpoena or other legal process, or a judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding that produces a request for information from H&R Block DTS. 



How You Will Know If Our Privacy Policy Changes.

If we make a material change to this privacy policy, including a material change in the way we disclose your personal information or a material change of policy due to a sale or transfer or our business, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such a change. We will notify you by using one of the following methods: (1) we will post a notice on our Web site describing the change; or (2) we will send you e-mail notifying you of the change. You may also have additional rights under state or federal law in the event of a change in our Privacy Policy. 

Updates or Changes to Your Personal Information.

Should your personal account information change or if you feel that the information that we have collected about you is inaccurate, you may update the information by signing into your account. H&R Block DTS cannot change information in your filed tax return. You must file an amended tax return to make changes to a filed tax return.

How We Protect Your Information.

H&R Block DTS maintains policies and procedures designed to restrict access to your personal information in several ways. These include programs and specifications for physical security and records retention and disposal; computer and communication security measures reflected in system design, password protection, and data management practices; and other measures to restrict access to the data we hold in physical and electronic forms. When you enter sensitive information in our online tax programs, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. 

Third Party Products and Services and Links to Third Party Sites.

H&R Block DTS' software and Web sites may contain links to third party Web sites or offers for services from third parties. Examples may include offers for refund anticipation loans or other loans offered through a third party bank, tax payment options and promotions for capital gains or investment software, tools or services. For any such third party products or services, you should carefully read the privacy policies of the third parties providing such products or services. This privacy policy applies solely to services provided by H&R Block DTS, and not to products or services offered by a third party. When you request products or services of a third party on our Web site, you are providing consent to us to provide your personal information to such party to fulfill your request. If you are a member of a third party site that has a relationship with H&R Block DTS, that site may use Internet cookies or similar means to determine if you purchase a product or service at H&R Block DTS in order to credit your account at such site with a bonus or incentive; however, H&R Block DTS does not pass any personally identifiable information to such third party site. 

How You May Control Use of Your Information.

We give you choice and control over the use of your personal information. You may limit marketing communications from H&R Block DTS as follows.

  * H&R Block DTS may use information you provide (subject to your consent, where required) to communicate with you about products and services available through H&R Block DTS or third parties. If at any time you wish to limit your receipt of such marketing communications, [click here](). At your request and subject to the limitations below, we will make reasonable efforts to limit all such marketing communications to you. In addition, when we send you marketing emails, we will generally include in each email a method to enable you to indicate your preference not to receive further emails.
  * Even if you opt-out from marketing communications, we may still provide you with information and notices that we deem important or required to complete your transactions with us. These may include legal notices, information about the status of your tax return or tax return filing, and other information or inquiries about your accounts and transactions with H&R Block DTS and its affiliates. 



The above paragraphs only apply to personal information H&R Block DTS obtains through the H&R Block DTS Web-based tax services or software programs, so you could still receive offers through H&R Block DTS, its affiliates or franchisees where they obtain your contact information through other sources. In order to opt-out from communications from our affiliates or franchisees, you may contact each such affiliate or franchisee separately in accordance with their policies.
