# H&R Block India, Online Privacy Practices and Principles

H & R Block (India) Private Limited ("H&R Block") offers a wide range of tax services, including tax preparation, tax planning, and business services in India. Because we offer a variety of services both online (via the Internet) and throughout H&R Block's nationwide network of offices, H&R Block's privacy practices may vary depending on how you interact with H&R Block. The following guidelines set forth general privacy principles that apply to information collected on the www.hrblock.in web site, independent of any particular business relationship you enter into with H&R Block. If you enter into a business relationship with H&R Block as our customer (such as when you are utilizing our tax preparation or other software or online tax preparation tools), we will make you aware of the privacy practices that apply to that particular business or relationship.

These practices do not apply to our physical offices you may visit for services, and these practices do not apply to other affiliates of H&R Block. Those H&R Block affiliates will provide you with their privacy notices when you enter into a business relationship with them. If you are a customer at our physical offices then you will be provided with a privacy policy at our physical office. 

## Information We Collect

When you visit www.hrblock.in, we may collect information about you from the following categories and sources: 

Information we receive when you request services or information from us or companies with whom we have business relationships, enter contests or sweepstakes, or complete surveys or polls, submit rebate forms, such as your name, address, e-mail address and payment or billing information. Information we may collect in connection with transactions including, for example, your name, address, account passwords, financial information including debit and credit account numbers, balances and payment history, income and assets

Information to prepare your tax return or for other financial products and services such as your name, address and certain other data such as your Permanent Account Number ("PAN"), income and deductions data, expenses data, vouchers, bank statements, and other personal information about you and your dependents that we need to prepare your tax return. The collection of this information is governed by the specific privacy policy for the H&R Block business providing these services to you.

Information you provide when you apply for employment with H&R Block or any of its affiliates.

Information we may collect from the tax authorities, our franchisees, our affiliates, and certain non-affiliated third parties such as credit reporting agencies.

Web technologies. We may collect information through the following Web technologies: We utilize a software technology called "cookies". Internet cookies allow us to customize our Website for you by placing small files on your computer as you visit various components of www.hrblock.in. Through the use of cookies, we can display only those items that may be of interest to you on a particular site, or make it easier for you to access your account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To opt-out of this type of advertising, please complete the form at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

Like most standard Web site servers, H&R Block uses log files. Information collected in log files may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not personally identifiable. When you use certain online tax services, IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable users to file or transmit tax returns to the tax authorities.

When you use calculators and other tools on our Web sites that do not require registration, H&R Block may collect non-identifiable data from such tools, such as the number of people that use a certain tool. H&R Block may also set cookies or clear gifs based upon your use of tools and calculators to help us customize offers and tools to your particular interests. H&R Block will not record or track any data you enter into standalone tools and calculators in any way that identifies you personally, unless we specifically inform you that we are doing so at the time you provide such data.

When you use our office locator service, we may collect data such as address or zip code information you provide so that we can better assess the level of interest in our services in a particular area, and the effectiveness of the locator tool at helping clients actually use our services.
