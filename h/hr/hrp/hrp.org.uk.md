We may collect and process the following data about you:

**Information you give us**

  * You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our website, purchasing tickets, membership or other products or by corresponding with us by telephone, email or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you subscribe to our newsletter, place an order on our site, and when you report a problem with our site. The information you may give us may include your name, email address, postal address and telephone number and financial and credit card information.



**Information we collect about you**

With regard to each of your visits to our site we may automatically collect the following information:

  * technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;
  * information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page and any phone number used to call our customer service number.



**Information we receive from other sources**

We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.

**Uses made of the information**

We use information held about you in the following ways:

  * Information you give to us: 
    1. When using an online form 
      * We ask for your details so we can respond in an appropriate way, for example when enquiring about a venue for hire or requesting materials.
      * If you have given your consent, you may be contacted with relevant promotions, offers or information that you have expressed an interest in or that might be of interest to you. If you wish us to stop contacting you please email [marketing@hrp.org.uk](mailto:marketing@hrp.org.uk).
    2. When signing up for e-mail updates 
      * We ask for your details so we can add you to our email database and send you updates youâ€™ve requested. This information will not be given to any third party, except to the extent and for the purpose we may be required to do so by any law. If you wish us to stop contacting you please email [marketing@hrp.org.uk](mailto:marketing@hrp.org.uk).
    3. When purchasing a ticket or other product online 
      * We collect various personal details about you when you purchase tickets or other products and services (e.g. memberships) online, including name, home address, billing address, telephone number, email etc. We use the information to process orders and to provide a more personalised service. Collecting these details allows our system to create a customer account for you in order that we can sell you tickets.
      * Having a record of your personal details also allows us to identify you if we need to contact you regarding your booking, if you need to contact us to change your booking, or to help identify you if collecting tickets at one of our palaces.
      * We are also able to help if tickets are lost by checking your personal details on the database. Additionally, our bank recommends that we take the billing address of people purchasing tickets in advance as this can help to prevent fraudulent use of credit cards. However, if you would prefer not to provide us with any of your personal information, you can buy tickets in person at any of the ticket offices at our palaces. For further information please see our [Terms of use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/ "Terms of use").
      * The information we collect will not be given to any third party, except to the extent and for the purpose we may be required to do so by any law.
