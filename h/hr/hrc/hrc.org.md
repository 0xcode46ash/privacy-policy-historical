# Privacy Policy | Human Rights Campaign

The Human Rights Campaign and Human Rights Campaign Foundation (jointly, "HRC") strongly believes in protecting the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our members and visitors to our Web sites ("End Users"). Since the protection of your privacy is of the greatest importance to us, we have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information, provided to us by our members and website visitors.

You do not have to share personally identifiable information to use the HRC web site. HRC does not collect personally identifiable information about people without their permission. However, please be aware that our site links to a limited number of other websites and HRC cannot control and is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those websites.

###  Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at hrc.org related to:

###  How we use the information gathered when you become a member of HRC or use one of our online services:

We gather contact information when you contribute to HRC online or via mail, join at pride or another event, when you sign up to use the HRC Action Center or when you sign up on one of our listservs such as Family Project, Workplace Project or in our press room. We use this information to send you legislative updates, action alerts, press releases, information about HRC programs, events and activities, local volunteer opportunities and membership and renewal appeals.

HRC also uses information gathered via the HRC website to improve our web-based services. HRC periodically performs statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas on our website and to use such information to improve on our website's ability to serve you better.

Cookies: HRC uses "cookies" on some webpages. A cookie is a small piece of data stored on an End User's hard drive but does not itself contain any personal information. Cookies enhance an End User's experience by saving the End User from having to log in or provide information each time he or she revisits an HRC webpage and by customizing content based on an End User's interests. An End User can configure his or her browser to be alerted when a site is attempting to send a cookie and refuse the cookie. HRC also tracks End User activity and click-through behavior to provide an End User with a more personalized experience while visiting our Web pages and for more personalized email alerts. HRC also uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Web site, track End User movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

###  How you receive e-mails and e-mail newsletters from HRC:

You will only receive email newsletters from us if you have a) expressly signed up to receive emails from Human Rights Campaign through the Human Rights Campaign website, b) taken action on behalf of HRC either online or in person; or c) and/or have been invited to sign up to to receive HRC emails at Prides, HRC Action Center and Stores, paid membership, public outreach or canvassing, and at many other hosted HRC events. The information we gather from subscribers for HRC’s email messaging (including email addresses) is not shared with other organizations or parties. In order to provide you with better and more relevant information, we compile information about email response and website usage. This information helps us to better understand our members' site usage patterns and also what types of content and information may help improve your user experience on the HRC website. All emails sent contain a link to unsubscribe or to modify your profile. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to any newsletter or email communication from HRC at any time.

###  How we protect your information:

HRC is extremely protective of the information gathered through its membership and website. Our website has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our web server is located in a locked, secure environment. All databases containing personal information are securely stored on a separate system that is not connected to the Internet.

When you contribute to HRC online, we use a secure server and encryption to protect your financial and other personal information during transmission.

HRC follows the Association of Fundraising Professional's (AFP) Ethical Guidelines to the Code of Ethical Principles and Standards of Professional Practice. Occasionally, HRC does exchange or rent mail lists to like-minded organizations through bonded third-party vendors. These organizations are never given information about our membership directly. We carefully screen each mailing before we allow it to be sent to our membership. Information pertaining to HRC board members, major donors, Federal Club members, Partners, and/or $250+ donors is never — under any circumstance — released to external entities for the purpose of list exchanges.

HRC does not specifically ask children under 18 for any information and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about them.
