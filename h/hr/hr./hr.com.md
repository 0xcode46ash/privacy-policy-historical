# HR.com Human Resources Management, Training, Jobs, Information

HR.com and its affiliates and partners respect the privacy of its visitors. HR.com does not collect any personal information through the web site without the knowledge of the visitor. 

The following information explains our information gathering and disseminating practices at HR.com. Please read this information so that you can feel comfortable about participating in our community. 

When a visitor arrives at the HR.com site they have three (3) options: Returning HR.com members login, Become an HR.com member, or Register as a guest. 

Registering as a guest requires you to register your email address. This email address is not used for promotional purposes. You are allowed to use the HR.com site as a guest 3 times. 

Our web server collects the IP address, operating system and browser software used. An IP address (which is different than an email address) can tell us the user's internet service provider, and based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection. We also collect information about which pages they visit, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks they click. This information helps us evaluate the effectiveness of various parts of the site. 

For the same purposes, we use "cookies" - small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - to help track your usage of our site. Cookies don't include personal information about you, but they are unique to each user, which allows HR.com computers to distinguish between users and can save you time when you return to a part of the site and repeat an activity. 

**Personal Information:**  
As an HR.com members you are required to provide certain information about yourself such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and in the instance of a purchase, your credit card information. If you elect to give us personal information over the Internet, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure the security of your information, including the use of SSL encryption to protect credit card information in the HR.com store. 

This personal information will be used to process orders, and to contact you regarding technical updates, special offers and upcoming events. We do not give your personal information to advertisers. All promotions are sent out through www.hr.com. The revenue derived from these promotions sponsored by vendors enables us to supply leading edge content, subsidize the production of our web site as well as support research and development efforts. 

All HR.com's Memberships are 100% funded by our Advertisers. As an HR.com member you will receive a minimum of 2 pieces of email a week. The first piece is an eBulletin (our weekly email newsletter), which outlines what is new at HR.com each week at a 20,000 foot level. The second is a direct advertising email from one of our valued Advertisers. If you do not wish to receive such communication from HR.com, please see our opt-out policy below. 

**Opt-Out Policy:**  
As an HR.com member, you can purchase an "Exclude Promotional Email Option" for $100.00. By selecting the Exclude Promotional Emails Option you will not receive any email advertising from HR.com advertisers and will enjoy the benefits of our Basic Membership. If do not want to receive information from HR.com regarding technical updates, special offers or upcoming events you can Purchase an Exclude Promotional Emails Option.
