# HR.com Human Resources Management, Training, Jobs, Information

HR.com respects the privacy of its visitors. HR.com does not collect any personal information through the web site without the knowledge of the visitor. 

The following information explains our information gathering and disseminating practices at HR.com. Please read this information so that you can feel comfortable about participating in our community. 

When a visitor arrives at the HR.com site, our web server collects the IP address, operating system and browser software used. An IP address (which is different than an email address) can tell us the user's internet service provider, and based on that, can suggest the geographic location of the connection. We also collect information about which pages they visit, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks they click. This information helps us evaluate the effectiveness of various parts of the site. 

For the same purposes, we use "cookies" - small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - to help track your usage of our site. Cookies don't include personal information about you, but they are unique to each user, which allows HR.com computers to distinguish between users and can save you time when you return to a part of the site and repeat an activity. 

**Personal Information:**  
We may ask you to provide certain information about yourself such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and in the instance of a purchase, your credit card information. Participation is completely optional. If you elect to give us personal information over the Internet, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure the security of your information, including the use of SSL encryption to protect credit card information in the HR.com store. 

This personal information will be used to process orders, and to contact you regarding technical updates, special offers and upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such communication from HR.com, please see our opt-out policy below. 

From time to time, HR.com may make our database list available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want to receive any mail (electronic or otherwise) from any organization to which HR.com provides its membership mailing list, please see our opt-out policy below.

This also applies if you do not want to have your information made available to other reputable organizations with whom we affiliate. Simply send us an email to: [ _privacy@hr.com_](mailto:privacy@hr.com) and in the subject line, simply enter: opt-out policy.
