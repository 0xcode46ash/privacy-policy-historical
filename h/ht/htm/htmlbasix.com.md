**What information gets gathered when you hit this site:**

We have a standard stats program which collects the following data: 

  * hits to the site 
  * which browser you use 
  * your ip address 
  * how many pages you access 
  * whether or not you clicked on a link to get here 

These are standard statistics of just about every website you visit. What do I do with this information? Not a lot. I just look at it sometimes. I don't collate the data and use it in any way. I could use it for demographics...but that sounds like too much hard work. None of this information is sold in any way.
