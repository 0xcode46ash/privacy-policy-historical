This allows us to get to know our Users better and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications for you. 
  * Users will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on Shoppingart.com's mailing list, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from Shoppingart.com. Users will additionally be given the option whether or not to opt-out from receiving offers from our sponsors and other affiliated third parties. Users may opt-out of Shoppingart.com's Mailing List and Newsletter by clicking the "Unsubsribe" link at the bottom of each email sent to them from Shoppingart.com or by sending an email to [info@shoppingart.com](mailto:info@shoppingart.com). 
  * When Users enter a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotional feature, Shoppingart.com may again ask for the User's name, address, e-mail address, username, password, and other various marketing data, demographic information, and consumer preferences so that they are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.

**How does Shoppingart.com protect visitor information?**

Shoppingart.com implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of User personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When Users place orders or access their personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by Users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Shoppingart.com's databases to be only accessed as stated above.

**Forums, Chatrooms and Messageboards.**

However, when Shoppingart.com makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, individual web pages, and/or news groups available to its Users, please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and Users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

**Tell-A-Friend, Ecards and Wishlist.**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, sending an Ecard to a friend or sending his Wishlist via Email we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Shoppingart.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email with the relevant information (Invitation, Ecard, Wishlist). Shoppingart.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Shoppingart.com to request the removal of this information from their database.

**Does Shoppingart.com use "cookies"?**

Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on the site. Shoppingart.com uses cookies so that they can help provide its visitors with a better experience on our site.

**Does Shoppingart.com disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?**

Shoppingart.com will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information that Users voluntarily provide through this web site without the prior consent of the User. However, such data, both in non-identifiable individual and aggregate forms, may be provided to other parties to deliver the User information he or she desires, as well as for marketing, advertising, or other uses in the future. 

Any e-mail newsletters sent to Users will contain instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a User at any time chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to Shoppingart.com's removal instructions and request to be removed from any such list and/or mailings, or they may also send such a request to [info@shoppingart.com](mailto:info@shoppingart.com). 

**Shoppingart.com's special note to parents**

Shoppingart.com believes that it is ultimately the parents' responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the [Direct Marketing Association home page](http://www.the-dma.org/).

**How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have provided to Shoppingart.com?**

After gathering any User information, Shoppingart.com offers Users the opportunity to remove information they have provided to us from our database so as not to receive future communications, or to no longer interact with the web site until they later chose to. Shoppingart.com additionally offers Users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by sending a request to view such information to [info@shoppingart.com](mailto:info@shoppingart.com), or by U.S. mail to Shoppingart.com Inc., Attn: Privacy Administrator, Elad Altstein. Users should submit any modifications and updates to the User information to the addresses listed in the preceding sentence.

**Third party links**

In an attempt to provide increased value to our Users, Shoppingart.com may choose various third party web sites to link to from, and frame within, its own site.
