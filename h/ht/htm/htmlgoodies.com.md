EarthWeb Inc. ("EarthWeb") provides interactive environments on the Internet to enable information technology professionals from around the world to find, use and share the information they need to do their jobs better and more efficiently. We at EarthWeb are committed to good privacy practices regarding your personal information. Your loyalty as a visitor, member, or customer is important, and we hope that our concerns regarding your privacy, as described in this policy (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy"), demonstrate our commitment to making your EarthWeb Internet experience an enjoyable and satisfying one. Although EarthWeb respects the privacy of all those who visit our Web sites and use our online services, we do collect information from our visitors, members, and customers. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with all EarthWeb Web sites, including but not limited to Crossnodes.com, Datamation.com, Developer.com, Dice.com, EarthwebDirect.com, ERPHub.com, Gamelan.com, GoCertify.com, HTMLGoodies.com, IntranetJournal.com, ITKnowledge.com, ITLibrary.com, JARS.com, JavaGoodies.com, Javascripts.com, OpenSourceIT.com, ResellerRatings.com and Y2KInfo.com, and your registration for and use of EarthWeb's online services (collectively, the "Services"). Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service and other published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about our members and visitors without their permission. Note that, by using the Services, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Services. Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes to this Policy will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please bookmark this page and review it frequently. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, or any other privacy issues in connection with the Services, please e-mail us at privacy@earthweb.com. **A. The information we gather.** EarthWeb gathers two types of information about users: 

  1. Non-personally identifiable information (information that does not identify a specific individual): When visitors use the Services, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Services. Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our Web site and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements. We collect non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" - that is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - that help us determine the type of content and sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular area of the Services, and the Services you choose to use. Cookies also tell us which advertisements you have seen on our Services, allowing us to continue to provide many of these Services at little or no cost to you. Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for the EarthWeb computers, or servers, that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus; they will not permit a Web site operator to learn any personally identifiable information (see below) about you unless you have previously provided that information to the Web site operator or you have set the preferences in your browser to provide this information. Cookies allow EarthWeb to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience with the Services - for example, by allowing us to save your password so that you do not have to reenter it each time you use the Services. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your Web browser. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. Please note that our advertisers and their designees, as well as other third parties, may collect information about you through cookies or other technologies when they serve advertisements through the Services or when you visit their Web site(s). Additionally, the Services contain links to other third party Web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with EarthWeb. You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their Web sites, including their use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors or Members "click through" links to their sites or view advertisements served by them. Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies. 
  2. Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the Services - such as those in which you apply for ITKnowledge membership, register at ResellerRatings.com, make a purchase through EarthWeb Direct, submit your résumé on dice.com, or enter EarthWeb-sponsored contests or promotions - we may request that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as (a) your e-mail address and a unique user name and password, as well as certain information such as your name, zip code, and profession, and (b) before making a purchase, your address, phone number, payment information (including credit card information), and other shipping information. We will, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional. Please note that EarthWeb cannot control the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, chat room, or other forum, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited e-mail from other parties outside EarthWeb. In the event that you encounter any EarthWeb user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact privacy@earthweb.com. 

**B. How we use (and do not use) the information we gather.** Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Keep in mind that, while EarthWeb encourages all third parties involved - including but not limited to its advertisers - to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and members and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from EarthWeb or independently. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with EarthWeb, who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact privacy@earthweb.com; we will be happy to forward your message to the third party. 

  1. **How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information:** We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and members, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their sites. 
  2. **How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information:** Please note that EarthWeb reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or member as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a visitor or member is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity. Finally, EarthWeb reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion or all of EarthWeb's or its affiliated entities' assets or stock. Subject to the foregoing, EarthWeb uses your personally identifying information in several ways: 
    * to customize various aspects of the Services to your preferences; 
    * to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen; 
    * to send to you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your use of the Services, such as system status updates or order confirmations (because these messages contain important information, you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages); 
    * to send to you EarthWeb solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be of interest to you (you may "opt out" of receiving these materials, as provided below); 
    * to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by EarthWeb and/or its sponsors (in no case will pre-populating a form automatically transfer any data to an advertiser or other third party - only if you voluntarily request that such data be transferred will any such transfer take place, e.g., by clicking the "Submit" button); and 
    * as may be necessary to support the operation of the Services, such as for billing, account maintenance, and record-keeping purposes. 
In addition to the circumstances described above, EarthWeb may disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties as follows 
    * with your authorization, such as when you click on a "submit order" or similar button when placing an order (your personally identifiable information will be shared with the merchant advertising the good or service you wish to purchase, so that such merchant may complete the transaction and ship the items(s) you have purchased); and 
    * if you either "opt in" to or choose not to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials (see below), to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you; and 
    * to send to you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your use of the Services, such as system status updates or order confirmations (because these messages contain important information, you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages); 
    * to our contractors and consultants, and professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under a duty of confidentiality. 
If you provide us with your credit card information, we will not release that information to third parties unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and such a third party. (Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.) 
  3. **"Opting In/Opting Out."** You may choose to "opt in" to receiving promotional materials from EarthWeb and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other business partners. You will be given the opportunity to "opt in" to receiving such materials at every point at which we collect personally identifiable information through the Services. You may change your "opt in" status with respect to such materials at any time by contacting us at privacy@earthweb.com. You may also contact those third parties directly. 

**C. Surveys and Sweepstakes** Occasionally, EarthWeb may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully. **D. Deleting or correcting personal information.**  
If you would like to have your personally identifiable information removed from EarthWeb's database, or would like to correct an error in such information, please contact us at privacy@earthweb.com, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within EarthWeb databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however EarthWeb reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or users of EarthWeb. **E. Questions?** Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to EarthWeb at privacy@earthweb.com.  |  |  |
