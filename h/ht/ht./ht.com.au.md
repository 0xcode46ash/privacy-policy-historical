Harris Technology is a Coles Group Limited business. Coles Group Limited businesses highly value the strong relationships we have with our customers. Often these relationships have been built up over many decades and with generations of the same family. The gradual introduction of data collection technology at Coles Group Limited will be handled with full and proper respect for the privacy of our customers.

To protect your privacy, you can visit Harris Technology's site without identifying yourself or having to reveal any information about yourself.

We may share this information, and only that information which is absolutely necessary, with those third parties that are involved in the processing of your order. For example, the financial institution that issued your credit card and the shipping carrier that delivers your order.
  * Harris Technology is committed to reducing the amount of fraud it faces. Our policy is that **we will prosecute** any cases of fraud that we identify. As a first time customer, you may receive a telephone call or email requesting more information/proof to confirm the details that you have supplied to us.

#### 2\. How We Protect Customer Information

For credit card transactions, Harris Technology adds security by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. This means that the credit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, preventing others from accessing your private information in between. So, when using an SSL capable browser, shopping on Harris Technology's website is the safest kind of transaction possible with a credit card.

#### 3\. How We Use Cookies & Other Technologies

A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a Web server to your computer. We use cookies when someone logs on to our website, to maintain that log on, to retain log on information if requested, and for the service of our [Shopping Cart](https://web.archive.org/cart.hts).

We do not use cookies for marketing, promotional or advertising purposes, nor do we use cookies to track your Internet activity before or after you leave Harris Technology. Any activity while you are at ht.com.au may be monitored.

#### 4\. How We Handle Marketing Communications

Harris Technology has found that attractive, graphics-rich emails are a quick, effective and low-cost way to communicate with customers and prospects about new high tech products, clearance and auction items. We maintain an opt-out, user-customisable subscription service of email addresses of people requesting promotional emails.

We do not want to send emails to you if you would prefer not to receive them. Therefore, every email provides a way for you to unsubscribe from future emails. In addition, you can visit our [Subscription Centre](https://web.archive.org/subscriptions.hts) to manage your subscription. We also have administrative procedures in place to remove email addresses and domains that consistently send failure messages to our email servers.
