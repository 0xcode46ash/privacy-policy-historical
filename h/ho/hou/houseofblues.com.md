## What kind of online information does HOB collect? 

You can visit most pages on our site as a guest, remaining anonymous by not providing information about yourself. Without this information, however, you will not be able to fully access all of the features and functionality of the site. We do collect some limited information about your visit but none of this information is personally identifiable to you. This information includes: your Internet location (IP address), your Internet entry point (ISP domain name), your software and its configuration used to access this site.

## How does HOB use and share my information? 

**Personally non-identifiable information.** We collect aggregated, personally non-identifiable information. These data are not linked to your personal information and are used to: diagnose problems with our systems, identify and analyze trends, track user movement (anonymously) through our websites and electronic communications, better administer our online products, and gather broad demographic information. We sometimes share aggregate demographic data with partners and advertisers.

**Personally identifiable information.** We collect information (e.g., name, email address, credit card) you provide when you establish an account, complete a survey, register for a contest, or place an order. We use this information to: send prizes to contest winners, send merchandise for online store purchases, contact you when necessary, and send information about our company or promotional material from our partners. Also, we are provided information, including email addresses, from various partners when you enter into transactions on their websites.

**HOB online orders.** When you make an online purchase from HOB, we use your information to process your order. We will send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions. In addition, you will be signed up to receive email updates about HOB upcoming events and offers in your area. When you first save your information, you will also be automatically signed up to receive email updates. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the instructions outlined below.

**Personalized experience.** In order to deliver information specifc to your needs, or to make your experience more convenient, we may use your identifiable information in a variety of ways on our webpages and in our emails. These methods may include: sending to you emails based on the information you provided or presenting you with particular offerings on our website based on your geographic location. When you enter a contest or take some action on our website that requires you to enter personal information, we may also use your personal information to automatically enter data into the required data fields for that contest or action.

**Contests and sweepstakes.** We regularly run co-sponsored contests and giveaways. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary; you have the choice whether or not to disclose information required for contest registration. Information requested may include: contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information is used to notify winners and award prizes. Additionally, we sometimes share registration information with our co-sponsors. We are not responsible for the use of such information by these or other parties. By participating in our contests, you agree we may use your information for marketing or promotional purposes.

## How does HOB protect my information and my orders? 

**Data security with online orders.** We use advanced security methods (Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption) on all pages transmitting private financial information, such as credit card numbers. The SSL protocol ensures that your information is sent directly to HOB and that only HOB can decode it.

**Physical security of equipment storing personally identifiable information.** Access to our computer equipment (servers) storing personally identifiable information is restricted to authorized personnel. These personnel have access to this equipment only for administrative purposes.

**Employee practices regarding security of personally identifiable information.** Authorized personnel access users' information records for the sole purpose of system maintenance.

## How does HOB protect children's privacy? 

As a general audience site, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from their parents. If we become aware that an account holder is under 13 and has signed up without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her account. Please visit the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998](https://web.archive.org/resources/inc/apps/redirects/redir.asp?target=http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) (COPPA) website for more information on protecting children's online privacy. 

## How does HOB use cookies and web beacons? 

**Cookies.** We use cookies; a small amount of data, often containing an anonymous unique identifier, sent from our computers and stored on your computer system. We set cookies on your computer for a number of purposes, including to: ensure you do not see the same ad repeatedly, deliver content specific to your interests, and save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

**Web beacons.** Our webpages and email messages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count how many users access featured content. We will not record your individual activity through web beacons for any purpose; it's a technology we use to improve the performance of our products.
