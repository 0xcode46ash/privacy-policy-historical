## Information Collection

### When no order is placed:

If you are a user of our site, but do not place an order or do not use our contact-us, order, or affiliate program forms, we 

  * do not collect any personal information about you 
  * do track Windows IIS Server Data/http data (such as IP address, browser type, referring web site address, domain name, access times, and which pages were accessed on the site) 



This log data is collected in our server logs, so as to help diagnose problems with our Web server, to monitor certain aspects of web queries, analyze trends, and to administer our Web site. This collected information is not linked to any personal information that you may provide when contacting us, or ordering from us. 

If you contact us via email, we require as a minimum 

  * your name 
  * E-mail address 



so that we may contact you; additional, opt-in, information may be given so as to describe you request. 

### When an order is placed:

If you place an order through our secure on-line form, or over the phone, we request your 

  * name 
  * telephone number (optional on E-mail orders) 
  * billing address 
  * shipping address, if different from billing address 
  * payment information 
  * E-mail address (optional on phone orders) 
  * a password of your making, to allow you to track orders on-line (optional) 
  * an opt-out selection for future email newsletter distribution 



US customers: Orders requiring importation into the US that also total $200 USD or more, must contain a tracking number, either an Employer Identification Number (also referred to as a Tax Id) or a Social Security Number (SSN). This requirement started October 1, 2004, and was made by US Customs and Border Protection, as a result of the Dept. of Homeland Security's initiative to improve security at the US border. 

This requirement does not apply to purchases that are either downloaded over the Internet, do not require importation, or are importation orders totaling less than $200 USD (2005). The tracking number must belong to the ultimate consignee of the party receiving any portion of the shipment. For further information on US security policies and requirements, please visit the US Customs and Border Protection [web site](http://www.cbp.gov/). 

As House Of Names customers are general consumers who do not normally have a Tax Id, we have elected to request the consignee's SSN number on the on-line purchase order form, when applicable. 

This number is provided to US Customs in electronic form, and printed on a hard copy of the invoice shipped with the product (if necessary). House Of Names will, in those cases where it must collect it, treat the customer's SSN identification with the same respect as any other personal information, and in particular with the same security as given credit card numbers; that is, the SSN will be recorded only for shipping requirement purposes, and is retained as per our Privacy, Security, and Information Retention policy, as documented further on this page. 

If you have concerns regarding this policy, contact House of Names via [E-mail](mailto:privacy@swyrich.com?Subject=HON%20SSN%20Privacy), or if you have immediate concerns regarding ordering and shipping, or if you wish to make a personal statement to House Of Names regarding such, call us toll free at 888-468-7686 (or 613-384-9986), x226.
