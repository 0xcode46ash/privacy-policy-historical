## American Customers

For U.S. Customers with immediate order form questions, see Online Ordering Help. 

This section does not apply to products downloaded over the Internet.

### Ultimate Consignee ID:

As of Mar. 2007, U.S. Customs defines an imported number as "either your IRS business registration number, or if your business is not registered with the IRS or you do not have a business, your social security number." This number is also referred to as the Ultimate Consignee ID number, and for businesses as a Tax Id or EIN. 

### Consignee ID on Order Forms:

When you make an order requiring importation to the United States, the value of which exceeds $200 USD, our order form requests that you provide an importer number. This ID is in addition to your regular shipping information, and ensures a speedy clearance of your order through U.S. Customs. For orders under $200 USD, the US Address of the consignee is sufficient for importation of goods. 

### Consignee ID Usage:

The consignee number is provided only for shipping purposes, to U.S. Customs in electronic form and printed on a hard copy of the invoice shipped with the product. U.S Customs, and shipping companies, will have access to the ID.
