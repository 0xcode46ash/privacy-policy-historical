**New Times**   
Parent of _Houston Press_ and houstonpress.com 

New Times respects your privacy. Here's our privacy policy for this site: 

**Personally Identifiable Information**   
We do track how our visitors use this site so that we can see what people like and don't like. We also analyze and aggregate information about use patterns and share the aggregated data with our advertisers (for example, we keep track of how many users see and click on particular advertisements). We may also collect personal information about you via registration for contests, surveys and newsletters. We will not, however, release your name, e-mail address or any other personal information to anyone else outside New Times unless we have your consent, we are under a legal order to do so, or there is an emergency involving personal danger. **This means that we will not provide our advertisers or anyone else outside New Times with any information specific to you unless we have your consent.** The only New Times employees or consultants allowed access to personal information about you are those who need to have access. Any employee or consultant who violates our privacy and security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination or prosecution. 

**Cookies**   
"Cookies" are small text files that allow Web sites to store and retrieve information about you from your computer system. New Times does serve cookies to track individual site usage for later aggregation. But we do not use cookies in order to retrieve any information from your computer other than information originally sent in a New Times cookie, such as a user code. We have no control over whether and how our advertisers use cookies **that originate from their website**. 

**Your Letter to the Editor Contributions**   
As with our print editions, we insist that you supply your real name, daytime telephone number or e-mail address. That is because we may need to contact you, and because your identity may be important to understand your point of view. If you send us such commentary, we reserve the right to publish it in print or display it on this site in full or in edited form. To protect your privacy, however, we will withhold your name and address upon request, both in print and on-line. 

**Communication from New Times**   
Any ongoing communication you may receive from New Times via e-mail, such as newsletters, subscriptions, contest results, survey inquiries, etc. may be terminated via a simple "opt out" procedure. You need only reply to the communication with the word "unsubscribe" (without the quotation marks) in the body of your e-mail response and your name will be removed from that mailing list. 

**Children**   
New Times does not orient this site toward children or target them as an audience, nor does it screen them from using the site. Some of the material on this site is for mature audiences, and parents and guardians should take responsibility for monitoring their children's use. New Times does not collect or distribute information indicating whether a user is a child. 

**Links to Other Sites**   
This site provides links and pointers to Web sites maintained by other organizations. New Times provides these links as a convenience to users, but it does not operate, control or endorse such sites. New Times also disclaims any responsibility for the information on those sites and any products or services offered there, and cannot vouch for the privacy policies of such sites. New Times does not make any warranties or representations that any linked sites (or even this site) will function without error or interruption, that defects will be corrected, or that the sites and their servers are free of viruses and other problems that can harm your computer. 

_**E-Commerce and Our Secure Server**   
All commerce transactions that take place on this site are processed through our secure server in order to make every reasonable effort to insure that your personal information is protected. Any transactions that take place on other sites that have link from our site are not necessarily handled in this fashion. New Times disclaims any responsibility for transactions conducted on those sites and cannot vouch for the security of the information submitted in those transactions. (This section posted and effective as of October 25, 2001)_

**Policy Changes**   
This privacy policy is effective as of July 28, 1999. We may need to change it from time to time as technology and the nature of the Web keep evolving. We will post any changes to this policy as soon as they go into effect. 

**More Questions?**   
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, e-mail them to [_privacyadministrator@newtimes.com_](mailto:privacyadministrator@newtimes.com), and be sure to indicate the specific site you're visiting and the nature of your question or concern.
