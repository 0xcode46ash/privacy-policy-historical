# House Party Privacy Policy

Welcome to _[www.houseparty.com](http://www.houseparty.com/)_ (the “ _Website_ ”) operated by House Party, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY  10533 (“ _House Party_ ”, “ _we_ ”, “ _our_ ”, or “ _us_ ”).  This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how your personally identifiable information (“ _PII_ ”) and other information is collected by us in operating the Website.   

   
**How does the Website Work?**    


The Website offers visitors to the Website (“ _you_ ” or “ _your_ ”) the opportunity to browse and interact with certain features on the Website.   By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by House Party as described herein.  House Party reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website at any time.  We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement.  Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.    


**What type of PII does House Party collect from you and how do we use it _?_**

   
House Party does not require you to provide us with any personally identifiable information (“ _PII_ ”) in order to browse the Website.  However, in order to use certain interactive features of the Website, you must provide certain PII to us.   For instance, House Party requests that hosts of parties provide us with their names, email addresses, and other like information.  However, unless you provide your PII to House Party through the Website, we will not collect any PII from you.     


House Party may provide your PII to entities who work on our behalf or with us.  These entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website.  For instance, we may transfer information submitted by you, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in running the Website.    


House Party may also share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you would rather us not share your PII with the any third party for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to House Party through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an “ _Opt-Out Request_ ”) to us at: House Party, Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY  10533 or by email at <URL>.

Please note that it may take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy.  Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing. 

Please note that if we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes, House Party may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by such third party (or any other party to whom such third party may have transferred your PII), and in such an event you agree that House Party shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition.  If you are concerned about House Party sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide your PII to House Party.   


We may also release your PII to third parties if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII, or as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of House Party.     


Please keep in mind that some of the content you post to the Website is publicly viewable to all visitors to the Website or to certain third parties recipients designated by you.  Do not post any content to a publicly viewable portion of the Website or send any content to a third party that you don’t want others to see.     


**What other information does House Party collect?   **   


We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods.  Cookies are small text files that identify your computer.  We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions.  An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed.  Tags may be associated with cookie information.  We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes.    


If you do not want us to track such information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence.  You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies.         


**How do we store information?**    


While we take reasonable efforts to protect PII provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.     


**Does House Party provide links to other websites?**    


House Party may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you.  Because we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this Privacy Policy.
