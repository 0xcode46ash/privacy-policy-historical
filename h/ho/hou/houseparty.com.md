# House Party Privacy Policy

We at House Three (the company that owns and operates houseparty.com) are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This notice explains our online information collection and use practices. Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. 

**• What Information Do We Collect?**

There are two types of information that may be collected on houseparty.com: anonymous and personally identifiable. Anonymous information is not associated with specific individuals. For instance, we may know how many people read this Privacy Policy today, but we won't necessarily know their names or addresses. Personally identifiable information reveals who you are and/or how you can be contacted. It generally includes your name, address, phone number and email address.

Information You Provide to Us: We encourage guests to surf houseparty.com, view content and learn more about our company and service offerings without any personal information being collected. Much of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from guests who are interested in obtaining more information about houseparty.com, our offerings or wish to participate in one of our promotions or services. Typically, this information could include the guest's name, postal address, email address, and telephone number. We may also collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. 

Information Collected Through Technology: We collect information through technology to make our site more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your school. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. 

Our site also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. 

There may be instances when advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third parties. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers who place advertisements on our site may also use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from cookies used by network advertisers on our site and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. 

**• How Do We Use Your Information?**

We may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained through cookies or third parties to carry out the promotions or services that you have signed up for or otherwise expressed an interest in. For example, we may use your information for sending electronic postcards and email messages on your behalf. 

We may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way. 

**• How Do We Secure Collected Information?**

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect guest information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

**• How Can You Edit Your Contact Information?**

You can access and update any contact information you may have given us (such as, your postal address, email address, or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you) by contacting us via email at [help@houseparty.com](mailto:help@houseparty.com). Please include information in the email that will help us identify you so we can assist you with your request. We may also provide you an opportunity to update your contact information by sending you an email or other communication that invites your response. 

**• Children's Privacy**

We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit our site or wish to participate in promotions or services offered through our site. This Section is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles with respect to children under the age of 13. 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites. 

We require children under the age of 13 to obtain verifiable parental consent before they can participate in any promotion or service offered on our site. We will only obtain an email address from a child under the age of 13 without such prior parental consent to a) respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis; or b) request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification. 

We will use our best effort to provide parental notification, which will include the nature   
and intended use of any of the child's personal information. We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of personal information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personal information collected from their child. 

We will provide parents notice by email of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child's personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current email addresses. We will apply material changes in our Privacy Policy as it relates to children's privacy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. 

**• How Can You Ask Questions or Send Comments About This Privacy Policy?**

Please be assured that any personal information that you provide in communications to the above email and postal mail addresses will not be used to send you promotional materials, unless you so request. 

**• Notification of Changes**

Our security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.   
We reserve the right to edit this policy at any time. We will contact you via email and post notification if there are any material changes in our privacy practices. We also encourage you to check the privacy policy out periodically.
