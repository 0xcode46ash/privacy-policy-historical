# House Party > Privacy Policy

Welcome to _[www.houseparty.com](http://www.houseparty.com/)_ (the “ _Website_ ”) operated by House Party, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY 10533 (“ _House Party_ ”, “ _we_ ”, “ _our_ ”, or “ _us_ ”). This Privacy Policy describes how we use and share the personally identifiable information (“PII”) we collect through this Website.

**Your Consent to This Privacy Policy**

The Website offers visitors to the Website (“ _you_ ” or “ _your_ ”) the opportunity to browse and interact with certain features on the Website. By browsing or using this Website, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your information by House Party as described herein.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

House Party reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement. Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.

**Privacy Notices**

This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on this Website. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of this Website may contain privacy notices providing details about the PII we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.

**What type of PII does House Party collect?**

House Party does not require you to provide us with any PII in order to browse the Website. However, if you choose to register on the Website, you will be required to provide certain PII to us. You may wish to register on our Website in order to receive information from House Party, to apply to become a party host, to register as a party guest, or to use certain interactive features of our Website.

**How do we use and share the PII we collect _?_**

We may use your PII to provide you with information you may request regarding our company, parties, or other information you may request through our Website; to process your application to host a party; to process your application to join certain groups or programs through our Website; to process an application for employment you may submit through our Website; to maintain your online profile; to communicate with you regarding your profile or any parties you have requested to host or attend as a guest; to process your entry if you have entered any contests or sweepstakes on our Website; and to learn more about your needs and wishes to improve this Website and other aspects of our services. In addition, if you register on our Website as a potential host, party guest, or otherwise, we will add you to our general e-mail list. 

House Party may provide your PII to entities who work on our behalf or with us. These entities may use your PII to provide you with materials or gifts related to a party you may host, to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website. For instance, we may transfer information submitted by you, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in running the Website.

We may share your PII with the companies for which we create (and for which you may host) parties (our “Clients”). Our Clients are thrilled that many of you will be hosting parties involving their brands, products or services, and they may wish to stay in contact with you following the completion of these parties. If you do not wish to be contacted by any of our Clients following completion of a party, feel free to opt out in any e-mail sent to you by a Client, and the Client will honor your request. Please keep in mind that opting out of further communication with a Client who send you an e-mail will not be deemed an opt out request for communications from House Party, and opting out from communications from House Party will not preclude you from receiving further communications from any of our Clients with whom you have established a separate opt in relationship. If you wish to opt out of communications from House Party, please see the section on Opting Out, below.

House Party may also share your PII with other third parties for direct marketing purposes, and you acknowledge that the use and handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You may opt-out of such sharing of your PII, as described below.

We may also release your PII to third parties if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization, including in connection with take down requests pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as described in our _Terms of Service_ ), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII, or as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of House Party.

Please keep in mind that some of the content you post to the Website is publicly viewable to all visitors to the Website or to certain third party recipients designated by you. Do not post any content to the Website or send any content to a third party that you don’t want others to see. In addition, please respect the privacy rights of others when posting information to the Website, and do not post any photos or video of individuals if such individuals would object to you doing so (in addition, all such postings must comply with the requirements for Registrant Content as set forth in our _Terms of Service_ ).

**Opting Out of E-mail Communications**

If you would rather us not share your PII with any third party for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to House Party through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with Clients or other third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an “ _Opt-Out Request_ ”) to us at: House Party, Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY 10533 or by email at [legal@houseparty.com](mailto:legal@houseparty.com).

Please note that we may not be able to comply with your Opt-Out Request immediately, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing.

If we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes, House Party may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by such third party (or any other party to whom such third party may have transferred your PII), and in such an event you agree that House Party shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about House Party sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide your PII to House Party.

**What if I refer a friend to House Party?**

You may decide to provide us with a friend's e-mail address or other information through our Website, by using our “refer a friend” function, our party invitation tool, or otherwise.  If you use our "refer a friend" function, House Party will send only the specified e-mail message to your friend, as indicated on the page on which you type your friend’s e-mail address, and we will use the information you provide only to personalize and send the message to your friend.  If you use our Website to invite a friend to a party you are hosting, we may send a separate e-mail to your friend explaining what the invitation and House Party are all about, and we or our Clients may send follow-up e-mails regarding the party you are hosting . Whether you use the "refer a friend" function or invite your friend to a party you are hosting, we will not add your friend our general mailing list unless your friend decides to register on our Website. 

**What other information does House Party collect?**

We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes.

If you do not want us to track such information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. However, if your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able to use or access certain features of our Website. 

**How can you access and update your information?**

You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into the Website and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into your account on the Website. 

You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases; however, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information may not be completely removed from archives of our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. 

**How do we ensure security of your information?**

We take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect through this Website. Additionally, we use physical and electronic security measures to protect your PII. However, it is important that you understand, that no website or database is completely secure or “hacker proof,” and we therefore cannot guarantee that your information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

**How is information handled for users outside of the United States?**

If you are visiting this Website from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located (currently the United States), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting this Website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you are located outside of the United States, you expressly consent to the transfer of your PII to House Party and (unless you have opted out of sharing your PII with third parties) its Clients or third party partners in the United States or in other countries in which our Clients or third party partners may be located.

**Does House Party provide links to other websites?**

House Party may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this Privacy Policy.

**What are our policies regarding children?**

You must be fourteen (14) years of age or older in order to register on the Website. House Party requires the consent of a parent or guardian before an individual under the age of eighteen (18) may be considered as a potential host for a party featured on our Website. 

House Party does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. If any children under thirteen (13) years of age wish to attend parties offered through House Party, we request that the parents of these children register on our Website rather than the children themselves, as we will not allow children under age thirteen (13) to register on our Website.

**Do we have a mechanism to address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?**

If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, please contact us at [help@houseparty.com](mailto:help@houseparty.com).
