### [Privacy policy](http://www.housingwire.com/about/privacy-policy/)

Here at _Housing Wire_ , we like to keep things simple; and that goes for our privacy policy.

So, here’s the information you need to know:

  * We collect your email address, should you choose to provide it to us.
  * We use your email to send you a daily news update, to send the occassional communication from the editor, to conduct semi-regular reader surveys, and to roughly take a look at who’s actually reading _HW_.
  * We use cookies with minimal information in them. Sort of. See below for details.
  * We use [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/), which is covered by [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html).
  * We use [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) to track feed stats and to process and send our daily emails



**Personal Information:** All of the personal information we collect is … are you ready? … your email address. Nothing more. In the event HW has outside advertisers, which we certainly believe will happen, your personal information (your email address) will not be made available to them.

**Cookies:** _HW_ uses a cookie on your computer in order to check whether you are logged in or not. This cookie doesn’t actually do anything, since you don’t have to log in — but if you did, aren’t you glad to know it’s there?

If you need any clarification or further details on any part of this policy, please [contact us](emailto:editor@housingwire.com).
