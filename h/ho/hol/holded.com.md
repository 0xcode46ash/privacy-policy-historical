The user data includes the user name and personal data, as well as photographs or other documentation that the user chooses to upload to the application in the account information part and the contact information. The account data are those related to the business account created by the user, in any of its different forms: Autonomous, Civil Society Personal or Limited Partnership, which include billing information, expenses, contacts, workers and products.Finally, Holded collects data from the connection device through cookies.
