# Holland America - Web Site Policy

   


The following information explains our policy regarding any personal information you may supply to us when visiting our Web site (site). By using this site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy. 

**1\. USE OF IP ADDRESSES**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Holland America collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 

**2\. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US**

During your use of our site, you may provide us with personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information) for the purpose of making reservations, requesting information or for other reasons. Holland America does not sell the personal information of our users to third parties. Holland America may use the information it gathers for its own internal purposes. Holland America's goal in collecting personal information online is to continually improve the content of our site and to offer consumers products that best meet your preferences and desires. Holland America may use the personal data you provide online to send or otherwise provide you with information about new products and services, or about offers that we feel may be of interest to you. As explained below, you may opt out of this service. 

**3\. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TRAVEL AGENCIES**

We may ask you to identify a travel agency that you work with. If you provide us with the name of your travel agency, we may share other information that you provided us with that agency. For example, if you told us that you were interested in a certain cruise product, we may tell your travel agency so they can discuss this directly with you. Travel agencies are not owned or controlled by Holland America. Consequently, we cannot tell you what travel agencies may do with information that we provide to them. 

**4\. INFORMATION GIVEN TO OTHER TRAVEL PROVIDERS**

If you use our site to purchase a travel product that is offered by another travel provider (for example, air transportation, hotels or shore excursions), we will give the other travel provider the information they require in order to process and confirm your booking. We do not place limitations on these other travel providers as to their use of this information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of other travel providers if you have questions about their use of personal information. 

**5\. OTHER DISCLOSURES**

In addition to the circumstances described above, Holland America may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or court order, as requested by a government agency or by law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary to protect the safety of our passengers, employees or property. 

**6\. OPTING-OUT OF CERTAIN SERVICES**

If you have signed up for email notification with Holland America Line, you may opt-out of receiving information via email about new products and services, or about offers that may be of interest to you, by sending us an e-mail at [optoutemail@hollandamerica.com](mailto:optoutemail@hollandamerica.com). Please tell us your name and e-mail address so that we can take the necessary steps. It may take several weeks to remove your name and e-mail address from our distribution system. 

**7\. MODIFICATION OF TERMS**

Holland America reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time at our discretion. You may check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of the site subsequent to the revisions of this Privacy Policy means you accept those changes.
