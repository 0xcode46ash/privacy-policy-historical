# Privacy Policy & Cookies - Tourism in the Netherlands - Holland.com

## Introduction

The Netherlands Board of Tourism & Conventions (the NBTC) is convinced that protection of the privacy of visitors to the Netherlands and to the website is very important for the provision of its services. We handle and secure your personal data with the utmost care. The NBTC will in all cases comply with the requirements of the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens), including when providing services outside the Netherlands. 

In accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act, the Dutch Data Protection Agency established in The Hague has been notified of our processing of personal data. The Party Responsible for the data processing is the NBTC, which is established at Prinses Catharina Amaliastraat 5, 2496 XD The Hague (the Netherlands). 

## Processing of personal data

Within the context of the provision of its services, the NBTC records data when you request information, order a brochure or have any other type of contact with the NBTC. The NBTC uses your data to send you the information you requested. In addition, the NBTC records data in order to improve its services and to keep you informed about (new) NBTC products and services and about the activities of third parties in the Netherlands.
