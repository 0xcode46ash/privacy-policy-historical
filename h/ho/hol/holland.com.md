# Holland.com : Holland.com Privacy Policy

Holland.com may collect both voluntary (names, addresses, emails, etc.) and involuntary (ip address, browser, operating system, and other technical data) information about all site users. Much of this information is used for identifying key demographic indicators of site users for the purposes of more targeted marketing strategies from our advertisers. Please note that this shared information is vague and never breaches your personal privacy by providing specific information that can be identified to you. It is the policy of Holland.com to never give this type of personal information to any third party sources without your express permission. We also strictly adhere to the COPPA act and require children under the age of 13 to obtain parental permission before submitting any personal information. We further recommend that children do not provide any personal information in their public profiles.

We have also adopted a policy to collect the minimal amount of personal information possible for MyHolland community registration. It is at the discretion of the user how much personal information they reveal to both holland.com and to the public through their personal management system "located in the MyHolland page." Under account settings, users can choose to opt-out of receiving mass mailings and divulging personal information to other site users.
