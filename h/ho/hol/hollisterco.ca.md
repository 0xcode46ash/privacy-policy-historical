### How Do Others Use Cookies on Our Website to Serve You Advertising?

We contract with third party advertising companies which collect non-personally identifying information about you by placing cookies on your browser and/or using Pixel Tags when you visit our site. These advertising companies may use information about your visit to deliver our ads on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks.  We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness. To stop receiving cookie-based ads from a third party advertising company we use, click on the link included in the advertisement and follow the instructions on opting out.  We may use more than one third party company for this cookie-based advertising, which would require you to opt out of each company through the advertisement links.  If you would like more information about how cookie-based advertising works in general and more opt-out information, go to: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (you will leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference).
