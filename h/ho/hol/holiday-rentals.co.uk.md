[Download as PDF](https://resources.homeaway.co.uk/info/files/live/sites/hr/files/shared/legal/171001%20HAUK%20Privacy%20Policy%20final%20clean--ts-2017-09-27T14%3A45%3A31_214%2B01%3A00.pdf "170704 HomeAway UK Privacy Policy-1.pdf \(Microsoft Word - 170704 HomeAway...")

_Last updated: October 1 st,2017_

At HomeAway, we are serious about protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and protect your personal information when you use this website, any other HomeAway website, and any HomeAway mobile application (collectively, the “ **Site** ”).

In this Privacy Policy, we use the terms “ **users** ” or “ **you** ” to refer to you as a user of the HomeAway service, regardless of whether you are:

  * a traveller who is using the Site to look for properties to rent (a “ **Traveller** ”),


  * a property owner, lessor or property manager (an “ **Owner** ”) who is listing one or more properties for rent on the Site, or


  * any other person who is using the software or other tools or services we provide on the Site.



Unless we explain otherwise in this policy, the words and phrases used in this policy have the same meaning as in the [Owner Terms and Conditions](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/about-us/legal/terms-conditions) and the [Traveller Terms and Conditions](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/about-us/legal/terms-conditions/traveller).

This Privacy Policy applies whenever you use the Site, including when you list or search for a property, use any tool or service on the Site, post any content, send inquiries or otherwise.  

  
**What is HomeAway?**

HomeAway is a venue that enables Travellers to find properties to rent from Owners.  We are a part of the Expedia group of companies, but please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to HomeAway websites and mobile applications in the European Economic Area.  Websites and mobile applications operated by other members of the Expedia group are governed by separate privacy policies which will be generally accessible through links in those websites and apps.    
 

In this Privacy Policy, we use the term " **HomeAway Group** " to refer to HomeAway and all of its affiliated group companies, including those group companies in the wider Expedia group of companies.

The Site is intended for use by individuals who are over 18 years of age.

**Who Processes Your Personal Information?**

Information that can identify you (" **personal information** ") will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by companies in the HomeAway Group and other third party data processors acting under our instructions or those of one of the companies in the HomeAway Group. These people may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your information requests and the provision of support tools and services on the Site. They may also be helping us maintain the integrity and security of the Site, including payment processing services and emails and messaging platforms on the Site.

We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include travel history and demographic information. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this collection, transfer, storing and/or processing.

When you use HomeAway’s services to connect with other people (for example, if you use the HomeAway network to communicate with Travellers who may wish to rent your property) that communication will also be accessible to us and will be covered by this policy.

Our Site may also collect and store some information (including personal information) locally on your device using your browser and data caches. This could include, for example, photographs of properties you have viewed online. We use this information in order to make our site faster when you visit and to show you properties of interest when you return to the Site.

Please also remember that when you share information on the Site, it may be “indexable” by search engines, including Google, which may mean that the information is made public. For example, if you review a property you have stayed at, the review and any information you provide as part of that review may be publicly accessible (including on other websites). Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any information that you expect to keep private. Please consult the Content Guidelines, https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/about-us/legal/terms-conditions/content-guidelines, for use of these features. We are not responsible for how third parties, including other users may use or disclose information that you post in public areas of the Site or otherwise directly share with other users or third parties.

HomeAway Group sites may also use Google Analytics to gather statistics on site usage. This may involve the use of cookies. There are more details in our Cookies Policy and in Google’s own privacy policy. Google may aggregate data they collect from their various services including Google Analytics, Google Translate, Google Maps and YouTube. You acknowledge and accept that HomeAway Group has no control over Google’s data collection. We strongly advise that you look at Google’s privacy policy for details of their data collection practices. You can find more information about how Google uses data here: <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>. If you want to opt out from Google Analytics, please check here: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

**The Information We Collect**

At various times you may give information to us. This includes information that can identify you, including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and credit card information. For example, in order to send a request or enquiry from a Traveller to an Owner, we may need to know all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, your current location, and, in the case of an Owner's listing, a method of payment. You may also give personal information to us at other times, such as when registering on the Site, when submitting an advertisement for a property or communicating with another user of the Site. We may also receive your personal information when you set up financial account information for payment processing.

If you make or use social media features on the Site, the social media provider may send us information in line with their policies. That information may include personal information such as your name, profile picture, gender, friend lists and any other information you have chosen to make available. Please note that, if you have friends using social media who are using the Site, they may also have shared information about you with us through the social media platform. If you wish to prevent that sharing, you can do so by editing the settings/preferences in your account with the relevant social media providers.

We may also gather information from cookies, web beacons or similar technologies from the internet. You can find out more about how we do that in the relevant section of this policy below and in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/cookies). We use publicly accessible information to verify information we are provided with and to manage and expand HomeAway’s business. With the prior user’s consent, as applicable, that can be withdraw at any time, in order to provide services requested by users, we also collect IP addresses, mobile device identifier details, your location, navigation and click-stream data, the time of accessing the website, properties you viewed, what you searched for, the duration of your visit, and other details of your activity on the internet. If you ask us to connect with other sites (for example if you ask us to connect with your Facebook account) we may get information that way too. In connection with electronic communications we facilitate through a Site, we use electronic or manual checks to monitor such communications for trust and security purposes. For further details on how we collect personal information, see Surveys and Newsletters below. We obtain data from you either by you inputting your personal details, by the automatic collection of information about you as you use the Site, when we speak to you, or from third parties or websites. Third party information may include financial information from our payment processor partners that we use to update our records and to prevent and detect fraud, information from your mobile provider if you are accessing the Site over a mobile device or information from a third party such as a social media or travel opinions site.

We may collect reviews written by Travellers on a property they have stayed in (“Traveller Review”) and/or written by Owners on a Traveller’s stay (“Owner Reviews”). Traveller Reviews are displayed on our Site, while Owner Reviews will only be disclosed to Owners who receive an inquiry or booking request from that Traveller. Owner Reviews enable an Owner to know more about the Traveller who has contacted them and therefore increase trust in our platform. Owners must comply with the [Owner Terms and Conditions](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/about-us/legal/terms-conditions) and applicable law and this includes not using any information about a Traveller to discriminate against such Traveller.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

Our primary purpose in collecting your personal information is to provide you with the services you requested and those which we believe will optimise your use of the Site. We may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * For the services provided on the Site or to support your request;
  * To contact you from time to time with critical user or service updates;
  * To send other messages that are useful to the service we provide on the Site;
  * To assist people you have done (or agreed to do) business with. For example, if you are an Owner and a Traveller who has booked or enquired with you needs your details we may pass them on; if you are a Traveller and an Owner you have booked with needs to contact you we may give them your details;
  * To provide personalised, targeted, or location-based content, services, and advertising from us and third parties with the prior user’s consent that can be withdraw at any time.;
  * If necessary, to measure your interest in and improve our products, services and the Site;
  * To promote the services related to the Site or those of the HomeAway Group, our parent company and its affiliates and/or our affiliates by email and via social media platforms;
  * To compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;
  * To provide information and statistics on the responsiveness of owners to enquiries on the Site, to improve Travellers’ experience using anonymous and aggregated information;
  * To detect, investigate and prevent activity we think may be potentially illegal, unlawful or harmful and to enforce our Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein or therein. We collate statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we pass onto third parties to assist us in improving the services we provide to you. We also use demographic information to tailor the Site and we share that information with third parties so that they can build up a better picture of our customer base and general consumer trends; and



To help us meet our legal and compliance obligations – for example we may use personal information we hold on you to do background checks, to screen prospective Owners against official lists in the UK and overseas and to do credit checks.

**How We May Disclose Your Personal Information**

We may disclose your personal information to enforce our policies, defend and protect the rights, property or safety of the HomeAway Group, the Site and the users of the Site, to comply with our legal obligations or in the interest of national security, public interest or law enforcement in any country where the HomeAway Group has entities or affiliates. For example, we may respond to a valid request by a law enforcement agency or regulatory or governmental authority (including tax authorities). We may also disclose data in connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to protect our property, people and other rights or interests.

We share your information with third parties (including other HomeAway Group affiliates) who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples include third parties who are hosting our web servers, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose.

We may also share your personal information as follows:

  * If you opt in to receive information about the opportunities, products, or services of third parties, we supply your contact information to those third parties so they may contact you;
  * When creating a profile on our Site, the information in your profile may be available to be viewed by other users of our Site;
  * We will display a user name (taken from your profile) with any content that you contribute to the Site (including Owners Review, Traveller Review, an Owners response to a Traveller Review, forum posts or any other content submitted by a User);
  * With an Owner if you send them an enquiry through the Site;
  * With an Owner, if you make what we consider to be a complaint either online via our website, by email to us, or by telephone and you agree to your complaint and name being shared with the Owner;
  * With another user if you have done or may do business with them;
  * We may display statistics of usage, such as information related to the responsiveness of owners, in the listings;
  * With Companies in the HomeAway Group and/or affiliates and our corporate affiliates in the leisure and travel sector, including the companies listed [here;](http://www.expediainc.com/expedia-brands/)
  * With other companies we work with to feature all or part of our Owners’ property listings or otherwise provide promotional or other services related to our or HomeAway Group’s business. This might include featuring your listings and photographs on other websites;
  * With any third party you have asked us to share your personal information with, which, by way of example, in the case of Facebook, may include identifying information if you have asked us to connect with your Facebook account; or
  * With any applicable tax authorities or other authorities allowed to collect taxes, where necessary to pay taxes from or on behalf of Travellers or Owners to tax authorities in accordance with our terms and conditions and to comply with any valid request
  *     You may have accessed our website through a hyperlink from the website of one of our trading               partners. If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase information including behavioural patterns being shared with that trading partner in accordance with our contractual relationship with them.

If any part of the HomeAway Group is sold, or some of its assets transferred to a third party, your personal information may also be transferred. Potential purchasers and their advisors may have access to data as part of the sale process. However, use of your personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the unlikely event of a liquidation, bankruptcy or administration. Our Owner, Traveller and user database could be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole or in a number of parts. It could be that the purchaser’s business is different from ours too.




We may also share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our websites. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest and to audit the efficacy of our advertising.

**International Data Transfers**

Personal information about users may be stored and processed in any country in which we, our affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities, including countries (like the United States of America) which are outside of the country or region in which you reside.

These countries may not have data protection laws as comprehensive as those in your country or region, but we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy at all times.

By using our services, you understand that your personal information may be transferred to our facilities and those of our service providers as described in this Privacy Policy.  
 

**Newsletters**

Users may subscribe to our newsletter service. We and HomeAway group may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the services we or they offer. All Users may cancel their subscription to these email newsletters at any time through the [**Communications Preference Centre**](http://mailaway.homeaway.com/PreferenceCenter), although it may take a short while for the changes in your preferences to become effective.

**Surveys**

We may use surveys to gather information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.

**Games**

From time to time we may provide games on the Site. These games may allow for connectivity with other users or third parties. If that is the case you consent to your personal information being transferred accordingly.

**Mobile Applications**  
 

When you download or use apps relating to our websites, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalised content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you consult your device’s manual, or contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.

**Telephone Calls**  
 

As well as collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with you face to face (for example at an Owner’s meeting) or by telephone. With the prior user’s consent, we frequently record telephone conversations for quality assurance and training purposes. Those recordings are also governed by this Privacy Policy and we keep this data in the same way that we keep other data. Recordings of calls may also be transferred to locations or processed worldwide.

**Enquiries and other Electronic Communications**

Travellers may send enquiries to Owners via a Site, and Travellers and Owners may also communicate further with each other via tools on a Site.  If you choose to send an enquiry to an Owner on a Site, your name and any other information you supply will be visible to the relevant Owner so that they can reply to you. Enquiries sent using the HomeAway system are also available for review by our employees, agents and representatives, who may use any such information as part of the services we provide.

If Travellers and Owners further engage in communications through a Site, we also have access to those communications, which we may monitor for trust and security purposes and in order to provide services.

  
If you engage in such communications and call the other party, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow such person and HomeAway group to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. Before disclosing any credit card or bank details or making any payments, please take the time to visit our [Community Pages](https://community.homeaway.com/community/uk) where you can find more details about phishing and how to reduce your risk.

We may also from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of such communications, and analyse the pattern of such communications for trust and security purposes as well as to gather data, such as enquiry and booking data (on an anonymous basis), to assist us in better understanding our business. Our system does not hold messages indefinitely and they may not be accessible after the message has been delivered to you.  ** _Please therefore print a copy of any message which is important to you_**  – for example a payment receipt or a booking confirmation.

**How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?**

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of your personal information and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal information. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the Site reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user's responsibility:

  * To protect against unauthorised access to your user account;
  * To ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user's device is logged on to the Site (including by logging on to your device through a mobile, Wi-Fi or share access connection you are using);
  * To log off or exit the Site when not using it;
  * Where relevant, to keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network. You should use a password which is unique to your use of the Site – do not use the same password as you use for another site or email account; and
  * To maintain good internet security and avoid security threats. For example, if your email account or Facebook account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure. If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.



Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure. As a result, others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.

**External Links and social plug-ins**

If any part of the Site links you to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy policies posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing personal information.  This may also be the case when any part of the Site uses social plug-ins from other sites such as Facebook. Plug-ins such as Facebook's "Like" button, "Comments" and "Facebook Connect", can be identified by one of Facebook's logos, such as the "f" or "thumbs-up" icon, and in practice are like a little piece of Facebook embedded on the Site. (The list of Facebook social plug-ins and their icons can be found [here](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins)). We also offer the option to register with our Site via the "Facebook Connect" Plug-in, which allows registered users of Facebook to register with our Site by using their Facebook account data without entering the required data manually on our webpage. Instead, your email address and Facebook ID will be transferred from Facebook to us and stored by us. When you land on any web page that uses these plug-ins, your browser sends certain information to Facebook. As with other websites that use these plug-ins, we do not control this data exchange. To learn more about the information that Facebook receives when you visit a web page with one of their plug-ins, we recommend that you visit Facebook's [help centre page](https://www.facebook.com/help/).

**What are Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?**  
 

A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by certain of our web pages. We or third parties authorised by us may use cookies to help us analyse our web page flow, customise our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here at our Site.

Our Site has a dedicated section on cookies which you can read [here](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/cookies).

You may delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will not work. We want to be open about our cookie use. Even if you are only browsing the Site certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details and the time of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Site and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

You can reduce the information cookies collect from your device. An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. Our cookies policy tells you how to do that. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Site may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalise your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this [site](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as you visit our site. By using the site, you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.

We gather and share information concerning the usage of the Site by Owners and Travellers with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics. In this connection, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed in the web page code, called pixel tags (also called a "clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons") that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies. Please [click here](https://www.homeaway.co.uk/info/cookies) to see the cookies we use when you browse our site.

Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximise web traffic flow.

**Display of Tailored Advertising/Your Choices**

But we also allow other third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) other HomeAway Group companies and/or affiliates; (2) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet.

To learn more, please click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) and [here](http://www.edaa.eu/edaa-for-users/).

Like other companies operating online, this site participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behaviour through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site.
