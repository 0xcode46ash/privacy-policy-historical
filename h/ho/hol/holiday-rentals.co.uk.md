These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country. However, if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.

**The information we gather**   
At various times you may contribute your personal data to us. For example, in order to process a request or enquiry you may make concerning a property or transaction, we need to know all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of a member's (advertising) listing, a method of payment. You may also contribute personal data to us at other times, such as when registering on the Site.  For further detail on our gathering of personal data, see Surveys and Newsletters below.

**How we use your personal data**   
Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services you requested and those which we believe will optimize your use of the Site.  You agree that we may use for personal data for the following purposes:

  * For the services or support you request;
  * To contact you from time to time with critical user or service updates;
  * To send other messages that are integral to the service we provide on the Site;
  * To customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;
  * To promote the services related to the Site or those of our subsidiaries and/or affiliates;
  * To compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;
  * To prevent activity we determine to be potentially illegal; and
  * for the enforcement of this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein or therein.



If you are a member, we will also be able to contact you about your account and your use of our services.

**How We May Disclose Your Personal Data**

We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a valid, legally-compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority, or in connection with actual or proposed litigation.

We may also share your personal data with:

  * One of our partners, but only if  you've requested their services or to be provided with information by them;
  * A third party performing services on our behalf which has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the conduct of an online survey, for example);
  * our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, but only for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy; or
  * other companies or business entities, in the event we are merged with or acquired by such company or business entity.



**Newsletters**   
As a member of the Site, you will receive our "Owner" newsletter, which is an integral part of the services we provide. Traveler users of the Site will be given the option to receive our "Traveler" newsletter when they registered with us. We and the websites of our affiliates may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time.

**Surveys**   
Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.

**Enquiries**   
Travellers may send enquiries to members via clickable links on the listings on the Site. If you choose to send an enquiry through these links, your personal information, including your email address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. The resulting enquiry is available for review only by the member to whom it was initially addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by members for their past enquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, we may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the enquiry emails, and analyze the pattern of enquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems.

**How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?**   
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each user's responsibility:

  * To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site;
  * To ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user's machine is "logged on" to the Site service;
  * To log off or exit from Site when not using it; and
  * Where relevant, to keep his/her password or other access information secret.



All personal information submitted to us is stored on a secure server. We do not store credit card numbers or related identifying information on any Site server. All such information is stored by our credit card processing partner(s), whom we contractually obligate to store such information using secure methods.  We also use third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising (see below).  All of our partners are under contract with us and they are obligated to keep your information confidential.

Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we contract with, others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data. 

  **What are Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?**   
A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by certain of our web pages.   We  or third parties under contract with us may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.   Cookies are commonly used  at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here at our Site.

If you wish, you can prevent cookie files from using (non-personal) information about you by either deleting the cookie folder in your browser or by putting your browser's Privacy setting higher, but doing so will mean that (a) your use of the Site will be adversely affected (and quite possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience will be adversely affected, and (c) you will not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). 

We gather and share anonymised information concerning the usage of the Site by members and travelers with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics. In this connection, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed in the web page code, called pixel tags (also called a "clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons") that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies.

Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow.Our third-party advertising service providers may also use Web Beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site and to help determine how you found the Site. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp>

**Phishing or False emails**   
If you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher" or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an email. Do not provide the information or click on the link. 

**How do I correct or update my information?**
