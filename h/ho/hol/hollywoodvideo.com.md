## Personally Identifiable Information

_What Personally Identifiable Information Is:_

Personally identifiable information is any information that identifies you as an individual. It does not include information about what you do on our site, because that information is kept anonymously in aggregated form. It does include your name, address, email address, phone number and/or credit card information.

_Where We Collect Personally Identifiable Information:_

Our sites may collect personally identifiable information submitted by you, if you are over 13 years of age. You are required to provide certain personally identifiable information in order to (1) apply for Online Membership, (2) subscribe to one of our newsletters, (3) enter one of our sweepstakes or trivia contests, (4) buy gift cards, (5) use our Store Locator, and (6) submit feedback, questions or “contact us” messages by email.

For more information about where we collect personally identifiable information, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy_details.aspx).

_How We Use Personally Identifiable Information:_

If you sign up for Online Membership, we will use your personally identifiable information to personalize your experience on our sites. If you give us permission, we will use your personal information to contact you for certain purposes, such as our newsletter.

Our sites compile aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports about which web pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns on the site. We do not combine personally identifiable information with information about web pages visited, purchases made, or any other clickstream data.

For more information about how we use personally identifiable information, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy_details.aspx).

_Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To:_

We will not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for use by them to send you unsolicited commercial offers. We do share your information with trusted third parties (other companies) that help us with administering our web sites, responding to your requests, and providing you with products and services. We do not allow these other companies to use your information except for the purpose it was provided. We will also disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, or to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to us or others.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies store information about your use of a particular Web site or service and are typically used to make services more convenient and personalized. We use anonymous cookies called “session cookies” to measure traffic patterns to areas of our site and to features mentioned in our newsletter. Session cookies are created each time you visit one of our sites, and do not remain on your computer after you leave the site. We use personalized cookies when you have registered as an Online Member, to customize your user experience. Personalized cookies are linked to your personal information and remain on your computer after you leave our site.

For more information about cookies and how we use them, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy_details.aspx).

## Children

Our sites comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Federal Trade Commission's rules interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. We do not permit children under 13 to register as Online Members, and we do not use personalized cookies for children under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personally identifiable information to us by misrepresenting his or her age, we will delete that information from our records.

## Choices You Have

_How To Update Your Personally Identifiable Information:_

To update or change the personally identifiable information you have given us, logon to your Online Membership account, or send us an email with your updated information. Send email to [privacy@hollywoodvideo.com](mailto:privacy@hollywoodvideo.com).

## How To Cancel Your Subscription to Our Newsletter

Please open the last newsletter your received and click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom. If you have any difficulties or questions please email us at [newsreel@hollywoodvideo.com](mailto:newsreel@hollywoodvideo.com).

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Please return to this page from time to time, as we will be updating this statement as our services continue to grow. If we make substantial changes in the way we collect or use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages prior to implementation.

## External Links

Our sites contain links to other Web sites not owned or operated by us. Although we try to provide links only to trustworthy sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of external sites. Online purchases of titles described on [reel.com](https://web.archive.org/offsite.aspx?url=http://reel.com) are through [Amazon.com](https://web.archive.org/offsite.aspx?url=http://amazon.com), and submission of your personal information to [Amazon.com](https://web.archive.org/offsite.aspx?url=http://amazon.com) is governed by the privacy policy of [Amazon.com](https://web.archive.org/offsite.aspx?url=http://amazon.com), not by this policy.

## Business Transitions

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of our assets, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site at least 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information. If, as a result of the business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given the option to delete your information from our records.

## Security

We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect our customers' information. Because network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

When you order gift cards or make other online purchases from us, sensitive information such as your credit card number is encrypted. We also make an effort to protect your information off-line. All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only associates who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All associates are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment.

## Site Ownership and Contact Information

Our sites are owned and operated by Hollywood Entertainment Corporation and/or its affiliates. Subject to your rights as described in this privacy policy, all customer information collected on our sites is the sole property of Hollywood Management Corporation, Inc., an affiliate of Hollywood Entertainment Corporation. Please direct your comments and questions to us via email at [privacy@hollywoodvideo.com](mailto:privacy@hollywoodvideo.com), via telephone at 1-877-325-8687, or via mail at Hollywood Entertainment Corporation, Attention: Legal Dept., 9275 Peyton Lane, Wilsonville, OR 97070.
