# Holiday Extras - privacy policy | How we use your information

"I would just like to thank you for the kind way you have dealt with us not only once but twice this year. We were unfortunate enough to not get away due to the ash cloud in April and you gave us a full refund, and again we were unlucky with the snow and then the spanish strike and a full refund was given. Without any hassle. What a professional service you have provided, we will continue to use you every time we fly. So again, thank you so much for helping us out,we lost a fair amount of money on both occasions, I wish other company's were more like you."  
Kind Regards  
**Marie & Paul Stone**

“I’ve used HolidayExtras.com on numerous occasions and I am always impressed with their service and their competitive prices. I find their website easy to navigate, use and I have the peace of mind that I know my car is looked after in their car parks. Their service and understanding during the volcanic ash disruption was amazing – a great demonstration of their dedication to customer service.”

## What personal information do we ask for?

When you have searched for prices and availability and are ready to confirm your booking, we will ask for your name, your postal address,your fax number and e-mail address. We'll also need your credit/debit card details (including card number, cardholder name and expiry date) in order to take payment and confirm the booking on-line. If you're paying by debit card we may need to take the start date and issue number of the card.   
We ask you for your telephone number in case we need to contact you urgently regarding your booking.  


## How do we protect customer information?

All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server. You can tell our site is secure as a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom left of your browser to show that you can safely send credit card details through our site. Another indicator is that our secure pages will not display a security alert message. 

We also have Firewall security software in place to protect our internal information from the Internet.

## Will Holiday Extras® use the information I give for direct marketing?

We won't disclose credit/debit card numbers unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

## Does the Holiday Extras site use cookies?
