##### COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY

This site is owned and operated by Farm & Cottage Holidays Ltd. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Farm & Cottage Holidays, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

##### INFORMATION FARM & COTTAGE HOLIDAYS GATHERS AND TRACKS

Farm & Cottage Holidays gathers two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters and to email a friend: 
  * Information Farm & Cottage Holidays gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs. Under no circumstances does Farm & Cottage Holidays Ltd divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 



We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:

  1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches). 

We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Farm & Cottage Holidays gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter.

  2. "E-mail a friend" policy 

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link to a property page to someone else by clicking "e-mail a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.

  3. "Live Chat" policy 

When the online customer service chat first begins, users are asked to enter their names in whatever format or detail they prefer. During the chat, users enter into a live question and answer session with an operator from Farm & Cottage Holidays. We maintain dialogue transcripts of these chats. After the chat, we ask users to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about our service. Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary.




##### Usage tracking

Farm & Cottage Holidays Ltd tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users.

##### Cookies

The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.

We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Farm & Cottage Holidays Ltd never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered into search engines as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
