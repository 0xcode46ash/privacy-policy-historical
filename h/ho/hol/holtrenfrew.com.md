Any aggregated user statistics and information will not contain any Personal Information.

#### How Does Holt Renfrew Collect Personal Information?

Holt Renfrew collects Personal Information in a variety of ways such as during the course of your purchase of products and services or your participation in one or more of our programs, contests, promotions or events.

Holt Renfrew may collect your Personal Information through a variety of means (e.g. you provide it verbally or in writing, including via electronic media). The following are examples of how we may do so:

  * the completion of manual or electronic forms; 
  * in person, by mail, over the telephone, through our websites or in any other direct manner;
  * enrollment in the Holt Icon Privileges program;
  * Contests and Promotional Events: From time-to-time Holt Renfrew offers various promotions and contests.

  * Video surveillance: We may collect Personal Information through video surveillance in areas in and around our stores, where applicable, for the protection of our customers, colleagues and assets and to protect against theft, damage to property and fraud;
  * Clickstreaming: Clickstreaming is a technology that allows a website operator to track the paths that surfers take as they access a website and look at the site’s pages, and as they use links to other sites. Holt Renfrew collects such information from visitors to **[www.holtrenfrew.com](http://www.holtrenfrew.com/), [www.holtrenfrew.com/men](http://www.holtrenfrew.com/men), [www.holtsmuse.com](http://www.holtsmuse.com/),** **[www.ogilvycanada.com](http://www.ogilvycanada.com/)** and [**www.holticon.com**](http://www.holtrenfrew.com/en/holt/twocolumn/footer/experiences/holt-icon/welcome);
  * Web Beacons: Web beacons are small, graphic images that allow a website operator to collect certain information and monitor user activity on its website.

#### How Holt Renfrew May Share Personal Information:

Holt Renfrew does not sell to third parties any Personal Information we collect. Holt Renfrew may share some Personal Information we collect to selected service providers, vendors, Leased Partners and other organizations outside of Holt Renfrew that help Holt Renfrew provide personalized products, services, programs, promotions, contests or events and advertising to you or help us with our business operations. When Holt Renfrew shares Personal Information with any such party, we limit the use of such Personal Information to those purposes requested by us and we require that the party has adequate safeguards for the protection of that Personal Information.

We may share your Personal Information where necessary to protect our interests or in the event of a sale or transfer of all or part of Holt Renfrew. For example, disclosure may be necessary:

  * in order to detect or prevent fraud;
  * in connection with a merger with another entity;
  * to insure or securitize our assets; or 
  * to engage in another form of corporate or financing transaction.



In such an event, we will ensure that the parties have entered into an agreement under which the disclosure of the information (including any Personal Information) is restricted to those purposes that relate to the investigation or transaction.

### C. Your Consent

We identify the purpose for which Personal Information will be used typically at or before the time the Personal Information is collected. Unless permitted or required by law, we will not collect, use or share Personal Information without first obtaining your consent.

As new purposes may develop over time, we may update this Privacy Policy so we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically.

#### Your Consent Can Be Express Or Implied.

Express consent can be verbal or written.

Your consent is implied when we can reasonably conclude that you've given consent by some action you have taken, or when you decide not to take action. By choosing to provide us with your Personal Information you are consenting to its use in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy and as may be further outlined at the time of collection. For example, if we give you an opportunity to tell us you don't want direct marketing material and you don't tell us that you don't want us to send it, we can conclude that you have no objection. We will rely on your implied consent to use and disclose identifying information about you, such as your name and address.

#### You May Withdraw your Consent at Any Time.

The protection of your Personal Information is of the utmost importance to us. If you don't want Holt Renfrew to use Personal Information collected about you for marketing or publicity purposes, please tell us at the time the information is collected.

You can withdraw your consent any time after you have given it to us, provided there are no legal or regulatory requirements to prevent this. For information on how to proceed, you can call or email our Chief Privacy Officer at 416-960-2860 or [**privacy.office@holtrenfrew.com**](mailto:privacy.office@holtrenfrew.com). You can also complete the [PRIVACY INQUIRY AND INFORMATION CHANGE FORM](http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/content/HoltRenfrew1/Change-Form-Privacy "Holt Renfrew Change Privacy Form") and present it for processing to any sales associate or concierge (where available) at any Holt Renfrew Store. Please note that you will be required to provide valid photo ID to verify your identity.

Please note if you don't consent to certain uses of information, or if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your decision. It is also important to note that it may take some time for all of our records to reflect changes in your contact and consent preferences. For example, if you request that you do not want to receive personalized marketing communications from Holt Renfrew your preference may not be captured for a promotion that is already in progress.

### D. Accessing, Verifying & Amending Your Personal Information

  


#### You Can Access and Verify the Accuracy of your Personal Information.

Holt Renfrew provides a right of access and review of Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws, and will endeavour to provide you with the Personal Information requested within a reasonable time.

Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, we will provide you with the reasons for non-disclosure.
