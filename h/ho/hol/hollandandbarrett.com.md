## **COOKIES**

To help you to better understand the cookies that we use on the Website we use a classification that was developed by the International Chamber of Commerce UK.  This explains more about which cookies we use, why we use them, and the functionality you will lose if you decide you don't want to have them on your device.

### **What is a cookie?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. This information is then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.

There are two types of cookies that can be used:

**Persistent cookies** \- these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

**Session cookies** \- these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

You can find more information about cookies at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

### **Cookies used on the Website**

A list of all the cookies used on the Website by category is set out below.

### **Strictly necessary cookies**

**These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for. For the types of cookies that are strictly necessary, no consent is required.**

These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, such as shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.

### **Analysis cookies**

**These cookies collect _anonymous_ information on the pages visited. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.**

These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Website; for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, which pages they go to next and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All the information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Website works.

### **Functionality cookies**

**These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.**

These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

### **Targeting or advertising cookies**

**These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.**

These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

## **Behavioural advertising and online privacy**

Behavioural advertising enables retailers to display adverts to you on the web based on the products and retailers that you have previously visited.  A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet advertising industry which can be found at [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). The guide contains an explanation of the self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control of the advertising you see.

We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with relevant online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of our cookies used for this online advertising, click [here](http://dtmc.hollandandbarrett.com/adinfo/choice/prod/?type=fpc&cid=61490&cname=Holland%20And%20Barrett&cmagic=e2db1b&clogo=61490.png&loc=us&lang=en-us)

## **Using browser settings to manage cookies**

You are able to use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that can be placed onto your computer.  The ‘Help’ menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.

However, cookies are essential to allow you to take advantage of some of the Website's features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. For example, if you block or otherwise reject cookies you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any of our products and services that require you to Sign in i.e. to track your Rewards for Life points. If you leave cookies turned on, remember to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

## **Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we and our third party tracking-utility partner gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

## **Social Media Features and Widgets**

Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Website. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## **Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at [customerservices@hollandandbarrett.com](mailto:customerservices@hollandandbarrett.com)

## **Disclosing your information**

We will never disclose your information to anyone outside the Holland & Barrett group of companies except where we have your consent; where we are required or permitted to do so by law, such as when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; where other companies who provide a service to us as part of our order process require that data i.e. delivery companies, payment providers; or companies who send out email communications on our behalf; or where they are successors in title to our business.  We will never share your data with other companies for marketing purposes. 

## **Other websites**

The Website may contain links to other sites which are outside our control and not covered by this Policy. The operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their policy, which may differ from ours.

## **Public Forums**
