**Hogrefe is committed to respecting data protection regulations. This statement informs you of how we intend to protect your rights and your personal data.**  
   
**We will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal data. We do not share personal data with other companies for marketing or similar purposes.**  
   
Personal data mean (a) the details you provide us using our forms, such as your e-mail address, ordering and billing information, your postal addresses and payment details, and also (b) data captured in authentication and tracking logs on areas of our site such as for online journals.   
   
Gathering, Storage, and Use of Personal Data  
Personal data are only stored when you have provided this information to Hogrefe of your own free will via forms that you have called up. The personal data we gather will be used to provide you with the services and products you order. We may also occasionally use it to inform you of new services and products related to those you have ordered and of changes and activities within the Hogrefe group. By registering for services and products on the Hogrefe website(s), you agree to us using your e-mail address in this way. In order to use or obtain some products and services, it will be necessary for you to register with us. The information you provide (such as your address) will be used to provide these products and services. We do not share personal data with other companies for marketing or similar purposes. By using our site and by registering for any of our services or products, you accept that personal data will be gathered and may be stored in our databases. In addition, in some areas of the site authentication and tracking logs may be used to produce usage statistics. These logs do not contain any personally identifiable information. Hogrefe reserves the right to have them analyzed by external service providers, in which case every effort will be made to protect the security, integrity, and privacy of the data.   
   
Encryption and Transmission of Personal Data  
Hogrefe takes appropriate technical and administrative safeguards to protect your personal data from loss and misuse. For instance, any personal data are stored in a secure environment that is not accessible to the public. In certain cases your personal data will be encrypted before transmission by means of so-called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology using a key length of 128 bits. The public key of the owner/registrant is documented by means of a certificate, in our case issued by Thawte. This means that communication between your computer and our server takes place using a widely recognized encryption technology, provided your browser supports SSL. Information and updates can be obtained from the producer of your browser.   
   
Use of Cookies  
Cookies are small text files that a website you visit creates and stores in a directory on your hard drive or in a temporary area of memory. During the process of ordering products or services from Hogrefe, temporary (session) cookies are used. By using the appropriate options in your browser, you can refuse to accept cookies. In this case, you will only be able to order one product or service at a time.   
   
Logging of Website Visits  
Every time our server is accessed, data are logged for statistical and security purposes, such as IP address, date and time at which the page or chatroom was accessed. A statistical analysis of anonymized datasets takes place to allow us to analyze and improve our offerings. No personally identifiable information is analyzed. In the case of severe infringements of our terms of use and of misuse or abuse of our servers, however, we reserve the right have individual data sets analyzed to help arrive at personal data.   
   
Protection of Your Personal Data  
After transmission to us, your personal data are stored on servers to which access is strictly limited. Hogrefe has taken appropriate technical and administrative measures to ensure that only authorized persons can access these servers.   
   
Your Right to Information  
As user, you have the right to request details of any personal data about you that Hogrefe may have stored. Such requests should be sent in writing to Hogrefe Publishing.   
   
Correction, Blocking and Deletion of Data  
Under certain circumstances, you are entitled to ask for correction, blocking (i.e. ban on future use by Hogrefe) or deletion of personal data by request this in writing. After deletion of existing personal data, certain services will not be usable. Your data will be deleted as soon as possible, and at the latest within a 6 month period as provided for by law in some jurisdictions.   
   
Links to Other Offerings  
Links to other internet sites and offerings are included in the Hogrefe site. By means of these links, Hogrefe provides access to use of these contents. Hogrefe is not responsible for these third-party contents nor for their privacy policy. However, when the link to these internet offerings was first created, Hogrefe did check the third-party content as to whether any responsibility according to civil or criminal the third-party content might arise.   
   
Our Rights  
Hogrefe does not guarantee that our offering will be available at any particular time. Disturbances, interruptions, or possible failure of the online service cannot be excluded. Hogrefeï¿½s servers are backed up carefully at regular intervals. It is recommended that you make backup copies of any data, in any form, that are transmitted to Hogrefe. Hogrefe shall not be liable for any loss of data or consequences thereof. Hogrefe reserves the right at any time to change, extend, reduce, limit or cease providing this service and to delete data without prior notice. You have no right to instigate proceedings.   
   
Announcement of Changes  
Should we change our privacy approach or policy, these changes will be announced on our website so that visitors will always be informed what data we gather, how we use them and whether they are transmitted to third parties.
