# Privacy Policy - Hogrefe

### Privacy Policy for Hogrefe Publishing Corp. and Hogrefe Publishing GmbH ("Hogrefe") 

At Hogrefe we are very conscious of the fact that when you use the Hogrefe website you are entrusting us with your personal data. We greatly value your trust and handle your data with the greatest possible care and confidentiality. This document describes how. 

**Anonymous Data Collection**

Unless otherwise mentioned in the following provisions, we do not collect, process, or use any of your personal data. When you visit our website, some information on your visit will be logged, such as the IP address, the type and version of internet browser, the OS you are using, the referrer URL (the website that linked to ours), and the time of the server request. This information can not be used to identify you. It will be evaluated in an anonymized form for statistical reasons. 

**  
Usage of Your Personal Data**

Your personal data are only saved if you authorize us to do so of your own free will by completing the relevant online forms or by registering to use our online-shop. We will make every effort to ensure that your data will only be used for their intended purpose and for the services you have selected.  
If you wish to send us a message via our contact form we need some of your personal data. Fields not marked as mandatory include additional data that you provide voluntarily for a better handling of your request.

  **Application process**

If you send us an application for a job via email, we will use your data solely to work on your application and we will not transfer it to third parties. Please note that applications via email will be transferred to us in an unencrypted form.

 **Use of Cookies**

Cookies are small text files that a website you visit creates and stores in a directory on your hard drive or in a temporary area of memory. They do not cause any damage there and do not contain any of your personal data. The information contained in the cookies enables us to recognize your computer during your next visit and is used during the new session, in particular to make navigation easier and to make the website more user-friendly (e.g., using your regional preferences). Most webbrowsers are set by default so that cookies are accepted automatically. You can, however, deactivate storage of cookies completely or set your browser to inform you as soon as cookies are sent. For details about the way how this works please refer to browser’s user guide. 

  

**Passing on Data to Third Parties**

Your data will not be passed on to other third parties unless we are required by law to share information or when it is necessary in order for us to fulfill the terms of our agreement with you. Personal Data may be disclosed to a third party service provider, if it is necessary. In this case the data we transmit is restricted to the minimum necessary to provide the service. Our external service provider is required by contract and by law to follow all pertinent data protection rules and regulations. 

   **etracker**

This website uses etracker technology (www.etracker.com) to collect data on visitor behavior. The data is collected anonymously for use in marketing and optimization. All visitor data is saved using an anonymous user ID and can be used to aggregate a usage profile. Cookies may be used for this purpose. Cookies are small text files that are stored in the visitor’s local browser cache. It is possible to use these cookies to recognize a visitor’s browser. The data collected by the etracker technology will not be used to determine the personal identity of a website visitor, and will not be compiled with personal data relating to the person referred to by the pseudonym, unless agreed to separately by the person concerned. The collection and storage of data may be revoked at any time with respect to future services.

 **Protection of Your Personal Data**

After being transmitted to us, personal data are stored on servers to which access is restricted. We deploy technical and organizational safety measures to ensure that the data are protected from intentional or unintentional manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by unauthorized persons. Our security procedures are inspected on a regular basis and will be adapted when technological progress means this is appropriate. 

**Data Protection Officer**

Should you have any questions about the processing of your personal data or about data protection in general, you are welcome to contact our Data Protectionn Officer:
