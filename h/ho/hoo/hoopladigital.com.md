## Privacy Policy

**Midwest Tape (hoopla)** is committed to protecting the privacy, accuracy, and reliability of any personal information you choose to provide and to safeguard loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration of this information. This privacy policy sets out how we use and protect any information that is gathered when you use this website. 

## What information do we collect?

We collect an email address and password of your choosing that we use to authenticate you when you use the hoopla service. We also collect your library card number and optional library card PIN so our system can communicate with your library's system to verify you are a patron in good standing. We collect no other personal information. 

As you use the hoopla service, we record how you use our application, including the materials you borrow. This information is reported to your library, content providers, and licensing agencies. When it is reported, it is always reported in aggregate with other patrons. It is never reported in a manner that associates your account with specific content or activities. 

## What do we do with the information we gather?

We use your email address and password to authenticate you with our systems. 

We use your library card number and library card PIN to authenticate you with your library's systems. 

We use a record of the materials you borrow to bill your library for usage, and to pay content providers a fee for distributing the content they have licensed to us. 

We use usage data to look for ways to improve the hoopla service, by making popular features easier to find, getting rid of features that few people use, or anticipating features people may wish we had. 

We may use your email in response to a specific inquiry or complaint you may have posted to us. 

Only when instructed or approved by your library will we use your email address to send information about the hoopla service, such as the announcement of new major features or new content providers. 

In all circumstances, your information -- whether public or private -- will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, other than for the express purpose of delivering the product or service requested. 

## How do we protect your information?

Your privacy is important to us. Therefore, we intentionally do not collect personal information from you other than your email address and a password of your choosing, your library card number and pin. All electronic communication between your web browser or mobile device and our servers is protected and encrypted via SSL (HTTPS). Your password is encrypted before it is stored in our database. And though we must report usage statistics to your library and to content providers, we never associate usage statistics with specific users. 

## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to third parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. 

## Third party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party links on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
