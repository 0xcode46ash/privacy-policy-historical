# hoosier lottery - privacy policy

Thank you for visiting the Hoosier Lottery website (www.hoosierlottery.com) and reviewing this privacy policy. The Lottery is committed to protecting your privacy. We use information collected to help us provide a better experience to you and to improve our games, website, and marketing efforts. This Privacy Policy tells you how the Lottery captures, handles, and shares the information associated with your use of the Lottery’s website.

### **Data Collection**

When you browse the Lottery website to read web pages or download information, the Lottery will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. Your Web browser software transmits most of this information to us; however, this information does not identify you personally.  We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  * The numeric IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access the Lottery website. The Lottery software can then map these IP addresses into Internet domain names, for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from a university’s domain; 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access the Lottery website; 
  * The date and time you access the Lottery website; 
  * The pages you visit, including graphics loaded from each page and other documents you download, such as PDF (Portable Document Format) files and word processing documents, and anything you may click on throughout the website; and 
  * If you were referred to the Lottery website from another website, the Lottery captures the address of the referring site. 



The Hoosier Lottery uses this information to make the website more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology visitors use.

### **Use of Cookies**

  
A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive in order to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online “shopping cart” to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the site’s computer which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that “cookies” are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a “cookie” on your computer. The Lottery uses cookies on its website. This includes temporary and persistent cookies.

A temporary cookie, also called a session or transient cookie, is a cookie that is erased when the user closes the web browser. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s computer. They typically will store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user.

A persistent cookie, also called a permanent cookie or a stored cookie, is a cookie that is stored on a user’s hard drive until it expires (persistent cookies are set with expiration dates) or until the user deletes the cookie. Persistent cookies are used to collect information about the user, such as web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific site.

### **Voluntary Personal Information Submission and Usage**

  
If you choose to identify yourself by sending the Lottery an e-mail, registering for advanced website services (such as “MY LOTTERY” functionality), participating in a contest or other promotion, or by using online forms, some personal data may be collected.

The term "personal information" refers to data that is identifiable to a specific individual, such as full name, address, birth date, phone number, gender, and games played.  If you choose to provide the Lottery with personal information, the Lottery may use that information to communicate with you, to process your registration and account, and to provide you with benefits and services including opt-in email or text communications, entry to second chance promotions, opportunities to participate in research surveys, and tailored interactive features of the website to your specific interests and needs (including periodically forwarding information that matches your selected interests). You are free to provide or to not provide the requested information. If you choose to not provide this type of information, you can still visit most of the website, but you may be unable to participate in certain online forums.

If you register for advanced services such as “MY LOTTERY” functionality, you may edit your account information and communication preferences or you may request the account be deactivated by e-mailing, phoning, or faxing the Lottery.  Please understand that, although we can deactivate your account online, state record retention laws may require us to maintain information about your account.

The Lottery does not collect information for commercial marketing.  It will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone.  The Lottery may provide the information to Lottery contractors for research or other purposes, including but not limited to disclosing site traffic information to improve the use of our site to our visitors.  These third parties do not have the right to use this information beyond what is necessary to perform the functions required by the Lottery.

### **Child Protection**

****  
The Lottery website is not directed to anyone under 18 and will not knowingly collect personal information from minors. The Hoosier Lottery encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide personal information online. The Hoosier Lottery does not sell products or services for purchase by anyone under 18.

### **Public Disclosure and Open Records Law**

  
The Lottery is required to maintain public records under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act for archival and historical purposes. When you provide personally identifiable information to the Lottery to receive requested services, such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to the Lottery, and subject to the laws, regulations, practices, and procedures of the Lottery.   To the extent that any information maintained by the Lottery is determined to be public record under the laws of Indiana, such personal information may be subject to disclosure to a third party under the Access to Public Records Act.

### **Security**

****  
The Lottery is committed to ensuring the integrity of the information and systems it maintains. As such, the Lottery has instituted security measures for all information systems under our control so that information will not be lost, misused, or altered. For site security purposes and to ensure that our Internet services remain available to all users, the Lottery uses software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

### **Changes to this Policy**

  
The Lottery may revise this policy from time to time. This is a statement of policy and should not be interpreted as a contract of any kind.
