This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms/default.aspx) Agreement. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by us via Hookit.com or Hookit.com-powered Community Sites and does not cover any such information collected by any other company or third party, unless specifically stated.

After you have registered at Hookit.com or your first Community Site, your Hookit.com membership makes joining other Community Sites easy. When logged in, Hookit.com recognizes you as a Hookit.com Member at all Hookit.com-powered Community Sites that you visit, so you need not login again. To join any additional Community Site that you visit, and gain access to your Hookit.com-powered Member features and services at that site, simply click the “Join Now” button. (Note that some Community Sites may set additional requirements for membership, such as geographic location or minimum age.

Third-party content providers and service providers also may use tracking technologies to determine how many times you have viewed their content or used their services. This information also helps advertising partners deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be most relevant to you. We do not have access to or control the use of tracking technologies by third parties, what information they collect or how they use it. Third parties’ use of tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies. Therefore, we encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of this Site.
