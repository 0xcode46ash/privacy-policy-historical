### Cookies

This site uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once a user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies, and other similar technology, can only record about a user what they have already chosen to tell us. Cookies cannot retrieve or transmit information you do not authorize.

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected.

## Cookies?

We use two cookies on our web site.  The **first cookie** is used for all visitors to our site, it is a string of letters and numbers unique to each visitor.  This cookie allows us to keep track of people coming to our site over multiple visits so that we can better understand how our site is used and how we can improve it. 

The **second cookie** we use is in our shopping section.  When you place an item in your **shopping cart** , we save the cart ID in a cookie.  This lets you leave the site without checking out and, if you return later, the contents of your cart will still be there, so you won't have to search for items again.
