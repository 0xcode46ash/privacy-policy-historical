  2. Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification.

We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity.



We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.

We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from their child.
