# Hoover's Online offers reliable up-to-date business information

Last Revised: March 2006

Hoover's, Inc., is serious about protecting your privacy -- whether you are a subscriber or a visitor. We use information collected about you only to process and bill orders and to make Hoover's a more useful and valuable service. Hoover's strives to respect the privacy of those who visit or become subscribers of the Hoover's Web site. The policy listed below is applicable to Hoover's and other sites on the World Wide Web that are maintained and operated by Hoover's, Inc. The terms outlined in this privacy policy may be updated over time. To keep up-to-date with Hoover's policies, please check this page frequently. Also, please remember that many services and transactions are performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our security or common practices do not necessarily apply to other companies.

## Your Information: What, How, and Why?

### Subscribers and Visitors

When you sign up to receive information from Hoover's, which means you register to receive a newsletter, have access to content, or request additional information, you are signing up to receive communications from Hoover's and/or its advertisers. Specifically, you agree to:

  * receive communication by e-mail (on behalf of Hoover's or our advertisers),
  * receive communication by postal mail (either from Hoover's or our advertisers),
  * receive communication by telephone (either from Hoover's or our advertisers),
  * receive communications with special messages, administrative messages, or announcements



Your information is maintained in a secure environment and is not shared with other partners except in those cases that are outlined in this statement. Hoover's employs a professional and secure e-mail hosting service to deliver e-mail newsletters and advertisements. A strict confidentiality agreement exists to protect your privacy.

You may choose to discontinue receiving any or all communications from Hoover's. For specific instructions on how to opt out of future communications, instructions are included in every e-mail, or continue reading below.

### What Information Is Collected?

  * Any information you provide during registration, including your full name, mailing address, e-mail address, company name, phone number, industry, and job title.
  * IP Addresses, which are automatically provided by your web browser to our log servers.
  * Information made available through the use of cookies or pixel tags (see below for more information about cookies and/or pixel tags). 



### How May the Information Be Used and/or Shared?

  * Demographic information is used in aggregate (i.e., non-individual-specific) form to attract more relevant advertisers to improve the customer experience.
  * Specific data points (e.g., job title, survey results) may be used to enable us to better serve our customers' needs through product enhancements and improved communication.
  * Information you provide may be shared with vendors specifically to provide a service (e.g.,newsletter delivery). The information is shared only to the extent necessary to complete the transaction you requested.



### Newsletters

As a subscriber or visitor to a Hoover's site, you may sign up for one of our free newsletters. When you sign up for one of the newsletters, we ask for contact information, such as your name and e-mail address, and job and job title information, which are used to help us understand our audience. This information is for Hoover's use only and is not disclosed to any other party except in aggregate form. Additionally, if you decide that you do not wish to receive a newsletter or update any longer, you may cancel it by opting out via the links at the bottom of e-mails you receive. 

### Surveys

Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our Hoover's visitors. From time to time, we request subscribers' or newsletter subscribers' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.

### How Do We Protect Subscriber Information Once We Have It?

All information is stored on a secure server. Hoover's uses Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server for our Web site. Browsers will encrypt the contents of the subscription form before sending it to our server.

## Cookies You Can't Eat

### What Is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. Hoover's uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits. Cookies allow Hoover's to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site is more personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at Hoover's.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to Hoover's and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that might be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

In order to make Hoover's a more valuable product for our subscribers and visitors, we also collect and analyze statistical information. From time to time, we share this information in aggregate with third parties. However, this data is reported only in aggregate and reveals no personal details about individual visitors to our site. This information is distributed only to help attract appropriate advertisers for the Hoover's site.

## Your Consent

By using our Web site and signing up for Hoover's services, you consent to the collection and use of the previously mentioned information by Hoover's. 

## Updating Your Information or Opting Out

You can edit or discontinue your newsletter/e-mail status at any time. *

* Hoover's periodically communicates information about a customer's account and or subscription service -- e-mails containing account set-up instructions, renewal notices, and information about product changes. For these types of communications, we must maintain an open channel to our customers to ensure the integrity of our service, and therefore cannot unsubscribe those individuals.
