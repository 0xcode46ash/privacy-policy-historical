# The Honolulu Advertiser

When you respond to a request at our site for personal information (for example, your name and email address), we reserve the right to use the information that you give us and to disclose it to third parties to provide you with information about products and services.

If the user does not wish to be included in such uses, the user must send an email or a letter requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or given or sold to third party vendors.

In addition to the uses noted above, visitors who supply us with personal information as part of an online survey or the community bulletin boards may receive a phone call from us for confirmation purposes or for an interview by a reporter.

Through HonluluAdvertiser.com, the user will be exposed to a variety of advertisements from third-party vendors. The privacy polices of these third parties are not under our control. The use of any information that you may provide to any third party will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site that you are visiting, which may differ from ours. As well, in some cases these third parties may share the information that they collect about you with HonoluluAdvertiser.com. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing, you should look for the privacy policy of the site that you are visiting via a link from that site’s home page or elsewhere. If you cannot find that site’s privacy policy, or if you are uncertain about the entity to whom you are providing your information, you should contact that site directly for more information.

HonoluluAdvertiser.com's Web servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the domain name (e.g., aol.com) of visitors, but not any information that personally identifies a visitor. This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. HonoluluAdvertiser.com is supported by advertisers, so having aggregate information about visitors helps us build a better site and attract advertisers, whose revenue allows us to keep the site free.
