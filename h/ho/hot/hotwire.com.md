# Privacy Policy - Hotwire Is a TRUSTe Privacy Program Licensee

**At Hotwire, we are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and purchases on our site.**

The TRUSTe "trustmark" confirms that Hotwire is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. To view Hotwire's TRUSTe validation, please click on the trustmark. 

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.hotwire.com](http://www.hotwire.com/index.jsp), including:

|  •  | What information we collect from you  
---|---  
 •  | How your information is used  
 •  | How your information is protected  
 •  | With whom your information may be shared  
 •  | Email communication you choose to receive from us  
 •  | How to access and control your account information  
  
We promise never to sell or rent any of your personal information without your prior permission. Your trust and confidence are our highest priority. For questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact Hotwire Customer Care (please see contact details below). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe. [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html) will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

  
What information we collect from you  
When you register with Hotwire, we ask for the basics -- including your name, email address and password. When you make a purchase, we will also need your billing and delivery information. 

To help us send more relevant communications to you (if you opt-in to receive any from us), we keep track of all site searches and purchases. For example, if you frequently travel between San Francisco and New York, we may send you special notices listing great recently booked fares for that route.

For all Hotwire visitors -- not just registered users -- we collect IP addresses, browser type, domain names, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new/repeat information, timestamp and exit page information. One of the uses for which this data is gathered is for statistical purposes so that we may analyze trends and performances over time.

How your information is used  
The data we gather is used to process your purchase, notify you of your booked travel itineraries, and contact you if problems arise (e.g., your flight is changed or cancelled by the airline). All data is saved in a secure environment. The information we collect helps us better serve you:   •  | We save all of your Hotwire searches, purchases and booked itineraries -- extremely helpful when you can't remember what time your flight leaves!  
---|---  
 •  | We process your purchases more quickly and efficiently using the data you provide. For example, if you opt to save your credit card number within your account, you won't have to enter it every single time you purchase on Hotwire.  
  
How your information is protected  
Hotwire maintains practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information. When you make a purchase on Hotwire, you are doing so in a safe and secure environment. Credit card information is transmitted online using industry standard security measures called SSL (secure socket layer encryption). Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. This means that information such as your credit card number is encrypted, sent through the Internet as a jumbled code, then decoded and passed on to Hotwire's secure systems. These safeguards are expressly implemented for the purpose of protecting your information. Hotwire also employs additional security measures for credit card usage. For example, when you make a purchase on our site, we require that you provide the credit card identification number -- a security code that helps validate purchases. Hotwire also offers programs such as Verified by Visa, which provides the added protection that only you can use your Visa card on the Hotwire site. Verified by Visa is available for eligible Visa cards from participating card issuers.With whom your information may be shared  
When you book on Hotwire, the personal information you provide will be shared with the appropriate third party in order to ensure the completion of your purchase. This includes the airline, hotel or car rental partner with whom your itinerary is booked, as well as any third parties responsible for facilitating the transaction (e.g., credit card authorization company). The personal information provided to the third parties will not be used for any purpose other than the purchase of your travel arrangements.

From time to time, we may share general statistical information about our Web site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services purchased, etc. -- with our advertisers and partners. However, we will never reveal your name, address or other personal data for anything other than the use it was originally intended.

Hotwire has partnered with reputable third parties to offer a wide range of products and services. Because our partners' privacy policies may differ from ours, we encourage you to review their policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.

Hotwire may be required by law to disclose information you have provided in obtaining our travel products or services. Hotwire may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to Hotwire's interests (e.g., customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. In addition, it may be necessary for Hotwire to provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.

How to access and control your account information  
Don't worry -- the information you save under "My Account" is securely stored and can only be accessed using your email login and password (both of which you choose when registering with our site).

Cookies  
A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your hard drive. This authenticated tag lets a server identify you. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a message such as, "Hi, Bob! Welcome back." At Hotwire, we use cookies to improve your shopping experience and reduce the time it takes for you to complete a purchase. Our cookies do not include any personal information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used. Please note that in order to use our site, your cookies must be turned on. However, be assured that Hotwire does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer that you did not knowingly and voluntarily provide to us.Third-party Advertising  
From time to time, Hotwire may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads on our behalf. Through the use of technology devices -- commonly referred to as cookies and action tags -- this third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of our ads. Hotwire does not have access to the third-party company's cookies, which are similar to our own cookies. The company employs an action tag -- also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel .gif file -- to set or read cookies. Any information that the company collects via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Hotwire's third-party ad server will also receive specific information about your order, such as the order number and product category. Rest assured that this shared information is completely anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. The company may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, they do not use names, addresses, email addresses or telephone numbers, and do not link online actions to an identifiable person. Sweepstakes  
Hotwire may occasionally offer site visitors an opportunity to participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes. Information collected by Hotwire for such a survey, contest or sweepstakes will be subject to the same protection as the information Hotwire collects from its users generally. Mergers/Acquisitions  
In the event that Hotwire or substantially all of Hotwire's assets are acquired, customer information may be transferred to Hotwire's successor company. In the event such a transfer occurs, the transferred information will be subject to the same protection as it was prior to the transfer.Recently Booked Deals  
Whenever Hotwire shows recently booked airfare, hotel or car rental deals, they are based on individual purchases that we aggregated (i.e., gathered up across all user accounts) during a specified time period. Deals are always accompanied by information on any necessary search parameters (e.g., purchase period, three-day advance purchase, Saturday night stay). However, no personally identifiably information is provided.Testimonials and Customer Feedback   
At Hotwire, we often receive testimonials and comments from customers who have had positive purchase and/or travel experiences with our site. We occasionally publish such content; in every case, the author has granted us written permission to use their submission. Testimonials never include the full name of the author -- just the first name, last initial and hometown.Children  
Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. Hotwire does not knowingly sell to anyone under the age of 18.Notification of Changes  
If we intend to use any personally identifiable information in a manner different than what is stated at the time of data collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your information. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site advising users of the change. In some cases, we may also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, informing them of the changes to our privacy practices. Contact Us
