# Privacy Policy - Hotwire Is a TRUSTe Privacy Program Licensee

This confirms that Hotwire is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.hotwire.com.

For questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact Hotwire Customer Care (please see contact details below). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. 

At Hotwire, we are committed to protecting your privacy and creating a safe and secure online environment for anyone who visits and purchases on our site. 

From time to time, we may share general statistical information about our Web site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services purchased, etc. -- with our advertisers and partners. However, we will never reveal your name, address or any other personal data for anything other than the use it was originally intended. An example of originally intended use would be providing your name to an airline partner for the purpose of ticketing. 

We promise never to sell, rent or give away any of your personal information without your prior permission. Your trust and confidence are our highest priority. If you have questions or concerns regarding your privacy or security on our site, feel free to contact us by email.

Data Gathering  
When you register with Hotwire, we ask for the basics -- including your name, email address, user name and password. When you make a purchase, we will also need your billing and delivery information. We gather all of this data (and save it in a secure environment) so that we can process your purchase, notify you of your booked travel itineraries, and contact you if problems arise (e.g., your flight is changed or cancelled by the airline). The information we collect helps us better serve you:  |  •  | We save all the searches you conduct on Hotwire for 48 hours, just in case you need to review them later.  
---|---  
 •  | We save all your Hotwire purchases and booked itineraries -- extremely helpful when you can't remember what time your flight leaves!  
 •  | We process your purchases more quickly and efficiently using the data you provide. For example, if you opt to save your credit card number within your account, you won't have to enter it every single time you purchase on Hotwire.  
  
In our log files, we collect IP addresses, browser type, domain names, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new/repeat information, timestamp and exit page information. All of this data is gathered for statistically purposes only - so that we may analyze trends and performance over time. None of this data is personally identifiable. 

If you choose to receive communications from us:  
 •  | We update you on any important functionality changes to our Web site via email.  
---|---  
 •  | We keep you informed about Hotwire deals, sweepstakes, programs, etc., that we think you will find valuable. For example, if you choose to provide us with information about your travel preferences -- such as which cities you most frequently travel between -- we can deliver highly relevant and customized email newsletters.  
 •  | From time to time, we may ask you to fill out optional personal profiles that will shape our future offers and promotions.  
  
Don't worry -- the information you save under "My Account" can only be accessed using your user name and password (both of which you choose when registering with our site). For more details on this subject, please refer to the [My Account,](https://web.archive.org/customer-care/my-account-faq/index.jsp) [Payment and Billing FAQs](https://web.archive.org/customer-care/online-payment-billing-faq/index.jsp) in our Customer Service section.

Please note that the Hotwire site may contain links that take you to other Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy practices may differ from ours. 

Cookies  
A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your hard drive. This authenticated tag lets a server identify you. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a message such as, "Hi, Billy Bob! Welcome back." 

At Hotwire, we use cookies to improve your shopping experience and reduce the time it takes for you to complete a purchase. Our cookies do not include any personal information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used. Please note that in order to use our site, your cookies must be turned on. However, be assured that Hotwire does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer that you did not knowingly and voluntarily provide to us.

Third-Party Advertising  
From time to time, Hotwire may use a third-party advertising company to serve ads on our behalf. Through the use of technology devices -- commonly referred to as cookies and action tags -- this third-party advertising company can measure the effectiveness of our ads. Hotwire does not have access to the third-party company's cookies, which are similar to our own cookies. The company employs an action tag -- also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel .gif file -- to set or read cookies. Any information that the company collects via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Hotwire's third-party advertiser will also receive specific information about your order, such as the order number and product category. Rest assured that this shared information is completely anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information. The company may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, they do not use names, addresses, email addresses or telephone numbers, and do not link online actions to an identifiable person. Any time Hotwire works with a third-party advertiser, our Privacy Policy will provide information about the opt-out process (in case, for example, you do not want your data to be used).  Security  
When you make a purchase on Hotwire, you are doing so on a safe and secure server. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. Hotwire uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you make a purchase. This means that information such as your credit card number is encrypted, sent through the Internet as a jumbled code, then decoded and stored on Hotwire's secure server. The information cannot be read while it is being transmitted. Email Communications  
With the exception of emails either confirming registration or relating directly to a purchase made on our site, Hotwire will not send you any postal mail or emails unless you elect to receive communications from us. If you are no longer interested in receiving communications from Hotwire, you have several choices for opting out of future mailings:   •  | In every email we send, we provide instructions on how to remove yourself from our email list.  
---|---  
 •  | Send an email to [TheHotwire@hotwire.com](mailto:TheHotwire@hotwire.com) and type "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.  
 •  | Call us at **1- 877-HOTWIRE (468-9473)**.

Notification of Changes  
If we intend to use any personally identifiable information in a manner different than what is stated at the time of data collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your information. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site advising users of the change. In some cases, we may also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, informing them of the changes to our privacy practices.  Contact Us
