# hotel.de | Data Protection Notice

### 1\. Anonymous use of the booking service and registration option

You can generally access our booking service without providing any personal information - it is possible to view the hotel offers anonymously. This means that you can obtain prices and view hotel descriptions without registering or logging in. However, to successfully complete a booking, your contact details are required. When you register, you will have the option to save your contact details; if you choose not to do so, your details must be re-entered for each new booking. Your contact and booking details can be viewed at any time, and you can manage your bookings, e.g. to make a cancellation. You may also amend or update your contact details at any time. Furthermore, you can store additional information, such as the invoicing address. It is still possible to make a booking without registering, but you will not be able to access the additional options described. 


### 2\. Data collection and use during the hotel search and booking process 

When a booking is made, the following information will be saved: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, booking details (hotel, location, arrival and departure dates) as well as any "additional information for the hotel" that is entered. When booking using a credit card, the credit card number, cardholder name and expiry date will also be saved. In addition, the time of booking and the IP address from which the booking was made will be recorded. 
Your details are used to coordinate, carry out and invoice a booking. On making the booking, a contract for the arrangement of the booking is made. The provider uses this information to execute the contract. 
When a booking has been made successfully, you will receive a booking confirmation e-mail from the provider. You will also always receive a confirmation e-mail from us if you make any changes to your booking or personal details. After your departure, you will receive an automated request to review the hotel you visited. 
If you give the names and contact details of other travellers, this data will be used in the same way. Please ensure that you have permission to use the contact details of other travellers for this purpose. 
We will also use your booking details (last name, first name, e-mail address and booking number) to send you an e-mail request to rate our website. You have the right to opt out of subsequent use of your data for this purpose at any time. 


### 3\. Additional data collection via app

When searching for hotels using the hotel.de mobile application (app for iPhone, Android, Windows Phone etc.), you can also request search results for your current location to be displayed. To do this, you must give the provider your current location. This is only transferred when the corresponding search function is used. The information is only used to determine the most appropriate search results. Location information is not stored by the provider or used in any other way. 


### 4\. Data collection and processing for applications via the application portal

When you apply online via the website’s application portal, various personal and contact details will be gathered. This includes your form of address, title, first name and last name, as well as your address, e-mail and telephone number and all attached application documents (uploads). 
This data is used solely for the purpose of processing applications within hotel.de. The persons responsible for the respective position and the relevant colleagues in the Human Resources department of hotel.de have access to the data. Data will not be forwarded to other persons or to third parties unless you have expressly agreed to your data being forwarded.
Data is transmitted via SSL (secure socket layer) and the data is saved on hotel.de systems with enhanced protection. 
If your application is successful, your data will be transferred to the personnel files. Otherwise, your data will be saved for six months after the rejection/end of the application period, unless you expressly agree to an extended retention period. Your contact details and the reason for rejection will be saved in the personnel department files and this information will be used in any future applications.


### 5\. Transfer of data to third parties

When a booking is made, your chosen hotel will be sent your contact details, booking information and, if appropriate, your credit card details (only for bookings made using a credit card), as well as any "additional information for the hotel" that you entered. 
Apart from the relevant hotel, no other third party receives any data, except in the event of a specific legal obligation. In the event of a criminal investigation, such as if it is suspected that a crime has been committed, all necessary data will be passed on to the authorities. 
hotel.de will not pass your details to other hotels and does not sell addresses. Respectful handling of your personal details is an integral part of the business philosophy of hotel.de. 
Service providers who process personal data on behalf of hotel.de are contractually obliged to observe the Federal Data Protection laws and are not considered third parties under data protection legislation. 


### 6\. Use of data in prize draws

To take part in hotel.de prize draws, e.g. to win a hotel stay, you must log in or register. The details stored are then used to inform you if you are a winner, and to ensure that each customer only can only enter the same competition once. Once the winner has been drawn, the prize draw partner is notified by e-mail. 
The details of the winner (name, address) are sent to the relevant hotel so that the winner can be authenticated. The hotel is instructed that this data is to be used only for the purposes of redeeming the voucher and that no further use is permitted. 
In individual cases we may, at the prize draw partner's request, ask whether you agree to your data being disclosed to the partner. In such cases, you have the option to consent to the disclosure of data by submitting a separate declaration. 


### 7\. Use of data for sending newsletters

If you have made a booking, the agent will use the email address you provided in this booking in order to inform you about special hotel offers, discounts or unique benefits from partner hotels in accordance with § 7 Para. 3 of the German Act against Unfair Competition (advertising own services by means of a newsletter). If you have not made a booking, you will receive this information if you have signed up with your email address to receive the newsletter.   
You can opt out at any time. To do so, simply send an email to [newsletter@hotel.de](mailto:newsletter@hotel.de)or follow the unsubscribe link in the newsletter. Your email address will then be removed from the list of recipients.


### 8\. Data use through integration of additional services

 **Cookies**  
The provider's website uses "cookies", which are small text files that are created on your computer and in which data is stored to enable recognition. Cookies are set during login/registration in order to authenticate the user during his active session. You can delete cookies from your computer at any time and can also use the website without them. 
**Plug-ins**  
The provider's website includes various add-ons (plug-ins, page content from other providers) for additional options. When web pages are accessed, a connection to the relevant provider is automatically established and this provider receives details of the user, such as domain name, access date, http response code, website requesting connection, data volumes and IP addresses or parts thereof. No personal data is accessed.   
The following plug-ins are included: 
AddThis (recommendation):   
AddThis (Clearspring Technologies, Inc., 8000 Westpark Drive, Suite 625 McLean, VA 22102, USA) uses data to allow you to recommend websites accessed (e.g. on Twitter) or to save bookmarks (e.g. with Google). When making recommendations or saving favourites, this information is saved and your recommendation/favourite is passed on to your chosen provider (e.g. Twitter, Delicious, MySpace) and saved there. Data transmitted by AddThis is processed further in accordance with the privacy policy of the company.   
[Further information on AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/privacy#publisher-visitors "AddThis - Privacy - Data Practices")


### 9\. Data use for website analysis (usage analysis)

The provider analyses visitors' user behaviour in pseudonymised form in order to determine demand for content and improve the range on offer. To do so, pseudonymous or anonymous details of users (including IP addresses) and user behaviour are recorded and used by the respective service provider. The provider uses the following methods: 
Google Analytics:   
Google Analytics, a website analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"), compiles anonymous statistics on the usage of the provider's website as well as anonymous reports on website activity, and analyses the type and extent of website usage. The IP address is transmitted in a shortened form so that this data also remains anonymous. The data is stored in the USA: Google observes the data protection provisions of the US Safe Harbor agreement and is registered with the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor programme.   
[Further information on Google website statistics](http://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html "Google website statistics")
Webtrekk:  
Webtrekk GmbH (Berlin) records pseudonymised and anonymised details about users such as browser type/version (e.g. Internet Explorer 7.0), browser language (e.g. German), operating system (e.g. Windows XP), internal resolution of the browser window, screen resolution, JavaScript activation, Java on/off, cookies on/off, colour depth, IP address and details of user behaviour such as clicks, time of access, duration, number and sequence of page views, referrer URL (the page visited previously) and options selected, as well as the fact that data was entered. From this information, Webtrekk creates anonymised and pseudonymised analyses of users and the page content used, as well as entered and cancelled search requests, exclusively for the provider. The data is stored at Webtrekk for six months. If you are logged in to the provider's site during page views, an anonymised customer number is also recorded so that the usage data can be linked to earlier use to create an overall usage profile. The usage data is then evaluated anonymously by the provider with other features (e.g. gender or location). 
Mouseflow:  
Mouseflow collects information about the browser (type, version, screen size, etc.), basic information about the user (IP address, language, time zone) and data containing mouse movements, clicks, scroll events and keystrokes are sent to Mouseflow. No personal data is sent, and no data is ever shared between websites. The script does not use third-party cookies. No data is shared with third parties, except for highly summarized data gathered across all Mouseflow accounts, e.g. usage share of browsers, average screen size, etc. Keystrokes from password fields and fields marked as “sensitive” are never recorded or sent over the network. hotel.de does not implement Mouseflow with non-public pages (ie. the booking process).


### 10\. Right to opt out of the use of data for website analysis (§ 15 Para. 3 of the German Teleservices Act [TMG]) 

You have the right to opt out of the use of your data for website analysis. 

With Google Analytics, you can deactivate data transfer to Google Analytics using an additional function for your browser (add-on). The deactivation add-on is available for download from Google.

### 11\. Protection of your data

The provider uses encryption to transfer your personal details securely. This applies to both your booking and your customer log in. The provider uses the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) coding system for this purpose. Your data cannot be read by anyone outside the company.
