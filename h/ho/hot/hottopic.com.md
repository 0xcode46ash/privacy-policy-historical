# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting [**hottopic.com**](http://www.hottopic.com/) (the "Site")

Respecting and protecting the privacy of users of [**hottopic.com**](http://www.hottopic.com/) (the "Site") is of great importance to us at Hot Topic. This notice describes our policies of information collection and our use practices with respect to the Site, and highlights choices you may have about the way we use and share such information. Please read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. Please be aware that if you use the Site, register in any fashion in connection with the Site, or participate in a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion available on the Site, you are agreeing to both the terms of our privacy policies and our Terms of Use set forth elsewhere on the Site, each as in effect from time to time. Please also be aware we reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time, and all such changes shall be immediately applicable. Please check this page periodically for changes. Our privacy policies and information collection and use practices in connection with the Site may vary from related policies and practices related to our offline activities such as our stores and our offline marketing activities. 

On the Site, you may be able to purchase merchandise, participate in our community features like chat rooms or bulletin boards, become a registered user, maintain a "wish list" or store other information on the Site, enter sweepstakes and contests, participate in surveys and polls, e-mail or instant message, subscribe to a service, or enroll to receive certain entertainment or information. We may need or request certain types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted, such as name, address, age, date of birth, sex, grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and credit card information) and collect it in connection with these various activities and offerings. We do not consider indications of your interests, likes and dislikes, or general characteristics such as clothing size or hair color, to be personally identifiable information unless it is somehow grouped with other information so as to permit identification of you specifically; but from time to time we collect such information also, in order to provide you better service or to get to know our user base and its general traits. 

Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address, should we be offering that service. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail address, sex and telephone number. 

The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among our transferred assets and the assets of any or all of our subsidiaries or affiliates if any of their assets is ever acquired by a third party. 

We use personally identifiable information for various purposes. For example, we may use information you provide to process your purchases of merchandise or to provide for merchandise delivery to your home. As a registered user, you provide us with information that we maintain and reference as part of our attempts to provide better and more personalized service to you. We might also use online registries or other databases to permit you to use and participate in certain portions in or features of our Site. We also use information users provide to conduct sweepstakes and contests, notify you if you win, and fulfill prizes or awards. In addition, unless you tell us not to, we like to provide you with certain information about our merchandise, sales or other offerings, and other marketing materials designed to help you use our Site and visit our stores with more information. We also use such information to make our online marketing and other communications with you more efficient. Similarly, we may use personally identifiable information in connection with certain of our activities with our partners, such as marketing efforts, co-sponsorships, and other initiatives. We also collect this information as may be reasonably necessary for tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state and local laws or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.

We may from time to time augment information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

We sometimes share personal information given to us with third parties. For instance, there may be third party service providers for our operations or business activities, with whom we have an agreement for services who transmit, store, analyze or otherwise use such information in connection with their services to us. We also occasionally share information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say hottopic.com's visitors are x percent females, and x percent males. 

We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies. 

We strive to make sure your preferences are respected. Therefore, you can tell us if you don't want us to share your personal information with third parties (other than in connection with administration of the Site or use over which we have no control, as described above) and we will do our best to respect that. In any event, when you receive e-mails or other communications from us our our partners, you should have the ability to "opt out" of receiving any further such communications, and we encourage you to exercise those rights should you see fit. Note that if you've signed up or provided information at different times for different purposes, you may have to opt out multiple times. If you don't want to reply to an e-mail you receive, or want a simpler way to opt out of receiving e-mails from us, you can just tell us what you want by contacting:

You should also know that, like many websites, our websites use "cookies," which are small amounts of data sent to your browser from a web server that is stored on your computer's hard drive.

We are committed to treating your personal information with high standards of information security. We work hard to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access.

By using the Site, you authorize the export of personal information to the United States and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us. This policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of the State of California and the United States, regardless of the location of any user.

You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from pages on the Site that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, or a link, the "click" takes you off the Site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policy of those sites. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware where you end up!

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect personal information provided to us and our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit online and you do so at your own risk.

Our policy does not extend to anything inherent in the operation of the Internet, and is therefore beyond our control. 

This Privacy Policy was last amended in April 2007.
