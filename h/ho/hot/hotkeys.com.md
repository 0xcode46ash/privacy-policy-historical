This Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our sites and our products and services offered through our sites. Hot Media is committed to industry self-regulation and strives to assure disclosure of our privacy practices to make our data practices transparent for our users.

##### PRIVACY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS

This section highlights the key takeaways from our Policy, but you should also read the full text of our Policy.

**Personal Information:** We use the term “personal information” to describe information that is associated with a specific person and is used to directly identify that person. We collect personal information about you when you voluntarily disclose or authorize the disclosure of such information to us (such as by registering an account or posting on our forums). Information Uses: We may use your personal information to communicate with you, run and improve our services and website, personalize content, and ensure compliance with the law.

**Uses:** We may use your personal information to communicate with you, run and improve our services and website, personalize content, and ensure compliance with the law.

**Information Sharing:** We do not knowingly disclose personal information that we collect from you to third parties other than our affiliated companies unless you consent to such transfer, or in the limited circumstances where such information is provided to a third party performing services for us under an obligation of confidentiality, in connection with a transfer of all or part of our business or assets, and for legal or regulatory compliance and safety purposes.

**Your Choices:** You can manage your privacy by editing your information on your account, opting out of emails and certain interest-based advertising, and turning off cookies in your browser.

Contact us by email at [privacy@demandmedia.com](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com).

##### PRIVACY POLICY

##### 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION

**Information You Provide To Us.**

We collect information you provide to us through the registration process on our website. We may also collect any information, including personal information, you post on any public areas of our website, like comments or forums, or that you may give us in any other way (such as through an email or survey) . Please note that we are not responsible for any personal information you post in public areas. Since information you post to public areas of our website is not considered private information, we may also feature your posted content, such as reviews or comments, on our website.

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any children under 13 or allow them to register on our website or use our services. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without her parent’s or guardian’s consent, please contact us at [privacy@demandmedia.com](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com).

**Other Information We Collect From You.**

In addition to the information you provide to us by registering an account or posting content on our website, we also collect information through the use of cookies and pixel tags. We also use cookies and other technologies to gather information about your use of our website so that we may give you a personalized experience of our website and help us understand how users are using our services.

**Cookies.**

When you visit our website, we may send one or more "cookies" – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the sites. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information, such as your preferences and login information. Our cookies do not collect personal information that you provide during the account registration process, but they do collect other information such as the following:

  * Your computer's IP address and information about its operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.), browser type, and browser language setting;
  * URL of the last webpage you visited before arriving at our website;
  * The date and time you access our website and pages you visit;
  * Demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you;
  * Your activity on our website (such as your clicks, pages viewed, comments, search results selected, etc.); and
  * Information to combat fraud or misuse.



For more information about cookies and how to manage them, please see the section below labeled Your Privacy Choices.

**Pixel Tags.**

Also known as a web beacon or clear GIF, a pixel tag is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email). We may use pixel tags to measure the number of clicks on certain pages or sections of our website.

**Information Collected by Third Parties.**

Our website and services includes links to websites and other content from third party businesses. We do not provide any personal information to these third-party websites, or other businesses.

If you click a link to visit another website or use the third-party referral service available on our websites or services, you will be subject to that website or provider’s privacy policy. This Policy only applies to information collected on website or through the Hotkeys service. You may also be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party in connection with promotions, sweepstakes or contests we host. If you are not willing to share the information with such third parties, do not participate in such promotions, sweepstakes or contests.

##### 2\. HOW WE USE, SHARE AND MAINTAIN YOUR INFORMATION

**Information Uses.**

We use your personal information to respond to your requests, personalize our service, administer our website, communicate with registered users, enforce our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigate and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and applicable law. We use non-personal information (such as demographic information, anonymous usage data, IP address, web browser information, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, etc.) to help us understand how our users are using our website or services and in turn make our website and more useful to you.

**Information Sharing.**

We share your personal information if authorized by you or in the following limited instances:

  * **Third Party Services.** We use outside vendors and services to help us better understand how users interact with our website, and to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. These third parties may have access to your personal information for use solely in connection with these authorized business activities.
  * **Business Transfer.** We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).
  * **Affiliates.** We may share personal information with our corporate affiliates (see www.demandmedia.com for our major affiliates). Any use of your information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates.
  * **Compliance and Safety.** We may disclose personal information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others. We may also disclose personal information in response to a civil or criminal subpoena or other legal process.



**Information Retention.**

We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information without notice, unless the law specifically requires otherwise. You must keep your own, separate back-up records. If you choose to permanently delete personal information from your account, back-up copies may exist for a short time in our databases.

**Information Security.**

On our side, we have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to help safeguard your information. However, neither people nor security systems, even encryption systems, are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If the law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, intentional misconduct will be the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty.

On your side, YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. You should protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer and sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer. We will not ask for passwords in an email, so if you get such a request, assume it is fraudulent. We also advise you not to disclose any information in public areas of our website that you do not wish to share, as it can be viewed and possibly used by others.

##### 3\. YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

We want to highlight the ways you can take control of your privacy at Hot Media. We urge you to explore these options and choose the level of privacy at which you are most comfortable.

**Account Preferences.**

As a registered user, you can edit your account settings and information at the point of sign-in for each respective website. You also can delete your account if you choose.

**Marketing Preferences.**

Users can also unsubscribe from our newsletters or opt out of receiving emails (such promotional emails) by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or newsletter. However, occasionally we may need to send you customary business communications such as website and administrative notices and confirmation emails, which you may not opt out of.

**Cookies.**

You can follow your browser’s instructions to remove cookies at any time. However, please be aware that if cookies are disabled or removed, our website may not function or appear as designed.

##### 4\. ADDITIONAL TERMS

**Identity Theft.**

If you believe that you are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from us, contact us at our Legal Notice address below and we will let you know what additional information you must provide to us.
