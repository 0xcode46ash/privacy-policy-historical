# Mattel, Inc. Website Policies

**A Special Note for Parents**

It is Mattel's intention, with each of its websites, to adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines, including its guidelines on Internet advertising. All Mattel marketing efforts, including this website, are closely scrutinized to conform to these guidelines. We encourage parents to monitor their children's online use, and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission. 

**Mattel Online Privacy Policy**

Mattel is very concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our website visitors. Although we track the total number of visitors to each of our sites in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our sites, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. Any "cookie" technology (where our servers deposit special codes on a visitor's computer) will only be used to track non-personal information such as type of browser, operating system, and domain names to improve our visitors' online experience. 

Mattel only collects personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor in one of our guestbooks, registries, or survey sections. We ask for age first so that we can provide our younger audience (under 18) with an appropriate questionnaire that does not ask any personal questions. In addition, we advise minors to get parental permission before filling out any online forms. Please see our Special Note for Parents (above). 

Mattel does not sell or release any information gathered on our websites to any third parties. All information gathered online will be used only by Mattel for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services and websites. 

In some instances, when an e-mail address has been provided by the visitor, and the visitor is 18 or older and has indicated that he/she would like to receive communications from us, we will send notices to visitors, usually in the form of an e-mail. These notices, sent periodically, will announce website upgrades, new product information and other similar updates. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy.
