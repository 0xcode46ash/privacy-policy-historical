**Security is a priority at Hotel Chocolat**

Security is a major issue for anyone purchasing on the Internet. You need to know that a website is legitimate, and transactions are secure before you buy. To address these issues, the Hotel Chocolat web site uses a Digital Certificate from BT TrustWise. 

Our secure server software uses the digital certificate to encrypt your credit card number. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code which are then securely transmitted over the Internet.
