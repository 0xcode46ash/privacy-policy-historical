EU General Data Protection Regulation "GDPR"

Lexyl shall Process Personal Data only on the written instruction of its group coordinators and in accordance with our Terms of Use and applicable laws (unless Lexyl is otherwise required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, in which case Lexyl shall inform its group coordinators of such legal requirement save where prohibited to do so by applicable law), and the group coordinator confirms that its documented instructions are for Lexyl to process the Personal Data as necessary for the purposes of our Terms of Use. Lexyl shall inform group coordinators if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes applicable EU data privacy and security laws;

Lexyl shall upon termination or expiry of the terms of use and upon the group coordinator's request, delete or return to all Personal Data save that, in the event that Lexyl is unable to destroy the Personal Data (due to backup or legal reasons), Lexyl shall continue to extend indefinitely the protections of these Requirements and immediately terminate any further Processing of the Personal Data without the group coordinator's express prior written consent, except where and to the extent required by applicable law. Lexyl's obligations under these Requirements to protect the security of Personal Data shall survive termination of our Terms of Use;

Lexyl shall ensure appropriate operational and technical measures are in place to safeguard the Personal Data against Data Security Breaches;

Lexyl shall notify group coordinators without undue delay if it becomes aware of any actual Data Security Breaches and shall provide reasonable information and cooperation to Group Coordinator so that Group Coordinator can fulfil any data breach reporting obligations it may have under (and in accordance with the timescales required by) applicable Data Protection Legislation;

(C) remains fully liable to group coordinator for any breaches of the Terms of Use that are caused by the acts, errors and omissions of its sub-processors;

If the group coordinator has reasonable data protection grounds to believe that a sub- processor appointed by Lexyl will render Lexyl unable to fulfil its data protection obligations under these Requirements, the group coordinator may, within 7 days of receipt of notice of their appointment, object to Lexyl's appointment of such sub-processor, in which case Lexyl will not allow that sub-processor to further access the Personal Data until the group coordinator has agreed to the appointment or replacement of the subcontractor or until group coordinator withdraws its objection;
