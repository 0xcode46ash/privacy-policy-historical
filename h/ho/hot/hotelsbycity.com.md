# HotelsByCity.com Privacy Policy

### When it may be necessary to share the information you provide:

HotelsByCity.com does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless it is related to fulfilling the services you've asked us to perform, or as is permitted by law. The information you provide us can only be shared under limited circumstances. These include:

### With service providers

In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product you order, to fulfill a service you request, or to market one of our products or services. While this may require us to share your information, these service providers are strictly prohibited from using your information other than to act on our behalf.

### For legal reasons

In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with the law, an investigation, or a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.

### In case of a sale of a business

Your information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Hotels By City, Inc., or its subsidiaries.

### Our Security Safeguards

We employ industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural security safeguards to protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web sites, we support encryption of your data as it is transmitted.

### Former Customers

We treat information concerning our former customers the same way we treat information about our current customers.
