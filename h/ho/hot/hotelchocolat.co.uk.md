To address these issues, the Hotel Chocolat website uses a Digital Certificate from Verisign. Our secure server software uses the digital certificate to encrypt your credit card number. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of code which are then securely transmitted over the internet. We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Hotel Chocolat cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.
