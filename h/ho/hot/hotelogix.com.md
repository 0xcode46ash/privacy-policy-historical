###### You control who has access to your data

The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the Users of an Organization is stored securely in a database and is only accessible to the approved Users of the Organization. The Administrator of the Organization (Administrator) will have full control over who is invited to be a User. A user name and password is required in order to access an Organization's information in HMS.

It is the User’s responsibility to keep their passwords safe. It is the Administrator’s responsibility to ensure that any Users that are invited to use the Organization’s account have permission to view the Organization’s information stored in the HMS account.

HMS, HMS’s staff and HMS’s partners do not have access to the User’s passwords and are therefore unable to access the Organization’s account or data without receiving an invitation from the Administrator.

###### HMS monitors system usage

HMS has access to and may use aggregate information such as number of associated Users, number of transactions and billing information for the purpose of billing and monitoring server and software performance as well as for other internal purposes of HMS.

HMS will never access the details of any financial transaction entered and stored in the HMS system. HMS will never access system usage history for a specific identifiable user, except where granted permission by the User to assist with resolution of a system issue or error.

HMS staff can access non-identifying and aggregated usage information and transaction volumes in order to better understand how our customers are using Hotelogix so we can improve the system design and where appropriate have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system. All aggregated usage information is stored in a secure HMS data warehouse facility.

###### Your data is sent securely across the internet

HMS Servers have Thawte issued security certificates so all data transferred between the Users of an Organization and the HMS Servers is encrypted. However, the internet is not in itself a secure environment. Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, data to the database within a secure environment. This means that the User’s browser must support the encryption security used in connection with the HMS Servers.

###### HMS does not store your credit card details

If you choose to pay for HMS by Credit Card, your credit card details are not stored by HMS and cannot be accessed by HMS staff. Your credit card details are encrypted and securely stored by Direct Payment Solution to enable HMS to automatically bill your credit card on a recurring basis. 

###### HMS will give you access to your data at any time

On request, HMS will provide the Administrator with a full export of the Organization’s data in a common file format determined by HMS. The Organization’s data may be permanently deleted by HMS 90 days after the Organization stops paying to use HMS, or at the Administrator’s request.
