# Hotel-Guides.us - Our Privacy Policy

* * *

We value our own privacy, and we genuinely respect yours. So here's what we do and don't do. 

  1. We do _not_ sell, loan, or give your email address to anyone. 
  2. We do _not_ share information about you with anyone other than a hotel where you plan to stay – and your credit card company – unless we are legally required to do so. 
  3. If we should sell Hotel-Guides.us (not in our plans), we will provide you ample opportunity to have your email address and other information removed from our records before we transfer them to the new owner. 
  4. We do use "cookies" – small bits of information that are saved by your web browser software on your computer's hard drive. One of the ways we use cookies is to store your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number when you make a reservation ... so you don't have to re-enter this information the next time you make a reservation. We do this only if you ask us to. If you do "opt in" to this convenience, the information will be stored in a cookie file on your computer for 180 days. We will never use a cookie to store your credit card or other financially sensitive information. 
  5. If you should ever have a concern about your privacy on Hotel-Guides.us, please write us at service@hotel-guides.us. 



Thanks for using Hotel-Guides.us ! 

We hope you enjoy your trip.
