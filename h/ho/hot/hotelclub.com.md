# Privacy Policy

**How we use the information**  
When you become a member of HotelClub or submit a booking request, we use the collected information in several ways: 

In addition, if you have opted to sign up for membership offered by our website, your email address will be used to send you an email message confirming your new member registration. As a member you, will occasionally receive updates from us about special rate offers, newsletters and any noteworthy changes to the website. However, you may always unsubscribe from receiving these email messages. Please see our Opting Out policy described below.

We disclose your information to third parties (such as our hotels) only for the purpose of completing your transaction with us, providing the above services to you and for the purposes of associated administration. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Your information will be provided to these organisations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to HotelClub, and under the instructions of HotelClub, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this policy. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside the EEA. We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Such situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our customers; to protect the rights or properties of HotelClub, our business affiliates, our customers, or others; or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

Like most web sites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, the browser you are using and your IP address. This data is utilised to improve the services of HotelClub and does not include any personally identifying information.

**How to access or correct your information**  
At any time, HotelClub members can view and/or update all the information in their member profile. To do so, login on the [Membership Homepage](https://web.archive.org/membership.asp) and click on "Update Profile" to view and/or make the required changes. Should you wish to cancel your membership with HotelClub, simply notify us by sending an email to [customer_service@HotelClub.com](mailto:customer_service@HotelClub.com?subject=Request%20to%20Cancel%20Membership). 

**Our commitment to data security**  
While being transmitted over the Internet, your credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Credit card details are only used to pay for accommodation booked through our service. These details are stored securely at all times, are not used for any other purpose and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties.

Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site.

**Opting out of promotional information**  
We at HotelClub work hard to provide our clients with the best possible rates in all our hotels. From time to time, we will send our members newsletters, updates and specials for hotels in certain areas. You will only receive this correspondence if you have chosen to do so and we hope that you will find these items informative and useful. However, should you choose to not receive them in the future, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from the mail database by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.

**How to contact us**
