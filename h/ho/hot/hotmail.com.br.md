_Privacy Principles_

Because your privacy is important to us, Hotmail operates by the following principles: 

**Principle 1.**   
Hotmail collects information during the registration process to operate the site ("Registration Information"). Hotmail explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). The Personal Information Hotmail collects includes first and last name. In addition to Personal Information collected, Hotmail also collects non-personally identifiable information (often referred to as demographic information) such as: country, region or state, zip or postal code, time zone, gender, birthdate and occupation. You may update your Registration Information at any time from within your Hotmail account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" icon. 

**Principle 2.**   
Your Registration Information is used only for demographic statistics and to display appropriate individualized advertisements. Hotmail keeps all of your Personal Information private and does not share it with any third parties, unless you choose, at the time of registration, to be listed in either the Hotmail Member Directory or the Internet White Pages directory. In the case of the Internet White Pages directory, we will share your registered name, location, and e-mail address with the Internet White Pages provider, InfoSpace, who may only use the Personal Information to provide their directory services. For more information about how to change your directory preferences, see the FAQ below. Hotmail will not disclose your Personal Information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft; (3) enforce the TERMS OF USE; or (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others. 

Your non-personally identifiable information from your Hotmail registration (such as zip code and gender) may be shared with other Microsoft websites to provide a more personalized advertising experience online. For example, you may see ads from a Microsoft bCentral/LinkExchange Banner Network member as you surf the Web but none of your Personal Information is shared with the third party websites. 

**Principle 3.**   
Hotmail will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, except as mentioned below. New users will receive a Hotmail welcome letter explaining the features provided by the service. Hotmail may also send periodic member letters to announce important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and news about other Microsoft products and services. Hotmail may also contact you to conduct research about your opinion of current and prospective services via e-mail surveys. Hotmail may from time to time contact you, on behalf of external business partners, about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. Hotmail will not share your e-mail address with these business partners. If you click on the link to the external partner's web site, be sure to review their privacy statement before sharing your personal information, as Microsoft is not responsible for their content. 

**Principle 4.**   
If at any time you believe that Hotmail has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at [Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com](mailto:Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem. 

If you have questions about this policy, please e-mail us at [Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com](mailto:Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com).
