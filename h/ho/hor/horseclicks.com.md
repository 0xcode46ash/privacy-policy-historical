# Equine Hits - Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

EquineHits.com ("EquineHits") respects and is committed to protecting your privacy. We have, therefore, established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit EquineHits's web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

EquineHits strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, EquineHits intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

**Information We Collect**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and/or a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any web page within EquineHits, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and/or IP address. The domain name and/or IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of EquineHits, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also "Disclosure to Third Parties" below. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals.

EquineHits may offer access to services that require registration. In that event, your registration and/or contact information may be used to send notification to you of EquineHits products and/or services by e-mail. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third party, without your consent or as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

When you use co-branded services or those provided by a third party within EquineHits, your Personal Information may be passed to that third party provider. Its use of your Personal Information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.

**Information We Do Not Collect**

When you visit our site, we do not collect your name, email address or any other Personal Information unless you provide it to us.

**Purchases**

If you are make a purchase from EquineHits, your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date are requested. This information allows your orders to be processed and fulfilled. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose.

Wherever EquineHits collects Personal Information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

**Security**

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within EquineHits or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

EquineHits may use a shopping cart feature that safeguards your Personal Information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate. SSL software encodes data transferred between you and the server. EquineHits is not responsible for any Personal Information you disclose to third party affiliates that do not use SSL software or do not offer a secure way to transfer information.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

**Third Parties**

Some pages on the EquineHits web site include links to third party web sites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and EquineHits is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices. Users submitting information to or through third party web sites should review the privacy statement of those sites before providing them with Personal Information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information online (e.g., through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere) that information can be collected and used by others.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

EquineHits will disclose Personal Information and/or an IP address when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  1. Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities and conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on EquineHits,
  2. Protect and defend the rights or property of EquineHits and related properties, or visitors to EquineHits and related properties,
  3. Identify persons who may be violating the law, the EquineHits legal notice, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing EquineHits or its related properties,
  4. Fulfill a user's order or request.



EquineHits uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. EquineHits reserves the right to transfer all such information in connection with the sale of all or part of EquineHits's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.

**Children**

Collection and use of information from children in the U.S. under the age of thirteen will be made in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998. Specifically, EquineHits will:

  1. provide parents or guardians with Notice of our information practices;
  2. obtain prior verifiable parental or guardian consent for the collection, use, and/or disclosure of Personally-Identifiable Information from children;
  3. provide a parent or guardian, upon request, with the means to review the Personally-Identifiable Information collected from his or her child;
  4. provide a parent or guardian with the opportunity to prevent the further use of Personally-Identifiable Information that has already been collected, or the future collection of Personally-Identifiable Information, from that child;
  5. limit collection of Personally-Identifiable Information for a child's online participation in a game, prize offer or other activities to Personally-Identifiable Information that is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity; and
  6. establish procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the Personally-Identifiable Information collected from children.



**Notification of Changes**

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the EquineHits service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you by e-mail with at least 30 days' notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your PayPal account, you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended Policy and your Personal Information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner).

We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the EquineHits web site at [www.equinehits.com](http://www.equinehits.com/) at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.

**Your Consent to This Agreement**

By using EquineHits, you consent to the collection and use of information by EquineHits as specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
