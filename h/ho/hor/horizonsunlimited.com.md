# Horizons Unlimited Global Enterprises Privacy Policy

We respect the privacy of our travellers: those who subscribe to the e-zine, those who e-mail us or contact us, those who use and provide information on the Horizons Unlimited Bulletin Board (HUBB), and those who post their travellers stories (blogs) on the site. 

#### What information do we collect and why

**It is our policy** to respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. 

The type of information we collect may include names, e-mail addresses, nationality and type of motorcycle ridden.

The purposes for which we collect information about individuals include the following: 

  * obtaining and responding to feedback from travellers


  * allowing people to share their experiences with fellow travellers on the HUBB, via forms (e.g. Shipping, Border Crossings) and in the e-zine


  * administering the HUBB to make it the best possible experience for the motorcycle travellers' community


  * contacting travellers about HUBB postings, shipping or border crossing experiences


  * sending our monthly newsletter to travellers who ask for it


  * organising Horizons Unlimited Travellers Meetings, including registering participants (for these events only, we request a mobile phone number for participants, to use in the unlikely situation that we have to contact them about changes or cancellations while they are on route to the event) 


  * preparing listings of businesses which we deem of interest to our readers for our Links or Shippers pages or in the newsletter 



#### Subscriptions

**It is our policy** to send the ezine only to those who request it (that is, opt-in). We remove names immediately upon request through convenient unsubscribe links in every mailing. Every issue of our ezine clearly explains how to unsubscribe.

#### Third Party Use

**It is our policy** to not sell, rent, or loan our subscriber lists to third parties for e-mail marketing. Who is a third party? Well, the first party is you, the second party is us, so it's basically anyone who's not you or us. 

While we sell advertising in our ezine and on the site to other companies, we never allow third parties any use of these subscriber lists.

#### Security and Disclosure on the Site

**It is our policy** to store subscriber and password files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files in areas not accessible to Web browsers, behind password protection, or off-line.

Spammers collect e-mail addresses from html web pages using robots (spambots). We use encoded e-mail addresses that a spambot can't read, but your browser can, throughout the site, and in forms where possible, to protect e-mail addresses from being 'harvested' in this manner.

##### Horizons Unlimited Bulletin Board (HUBB)

When you register for the HUBB, we require a valid e-mail address to confirm your registration and to keep spammers out! Your e-mail address is ONLY visible to the Administrators (Grant and Susan). You can optionally enter informaton, such as name, nationality, bike, etc. to be viewable by registered users. You can access and update your personal information in the 'User Options - Profile' section at any time. 

If someone needs to contact you we provide a Private Messaging system and email system via the HUBB to send you messages. You can choose, in your User Profile, to allow or disallow either.

We strongly recommend NOT putting your e-mail address in a posting. Why is this important? The HUBB pages are ordinary html web pages, like 99.99% of the web, which means that a spambot can read your e-mail address and "harvest" it, and add you to their list of people to send spam to. 

Submitting information on Forms

When you submit shipment information via the Shipping form, you must register and provide us with your e-mail address so we can contact you if necessary about your shipment details. We do not accept anonymous shipment postings (to prevent shipping companies or individuals from posting advertisements under the guise of shipment details), and your full name will be included in the shipment posting, but your e-mail address is not disclosed unless YOU put it into the details of the shipment. We recommend you NOT do this, for the reasons above.

This is for YOUR protection. Your security and privacy is important to us, and we do all we can to ensure it.
