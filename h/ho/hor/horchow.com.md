Secure Ordering  


Your online credit card transactions are secure with Horchow.com. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe Internet transmission of your personal information. When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give you a pop-up message that you're about to enter a secure area.

Making a credit card purchase is just as safe on our Web site as it is by telephone, but if you prefer the latter, you may purchase online merchandise by calling toll-free 1.877.944.9888 -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week. One of our customer service associates will gladly take your order.

Privacy Policy  


To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as from other parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner.

We have posted this privacy policy to let you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, what choices you have regarding our use of your information, and how you may access some of the information you provide to us.

As we continue to develop our Web site and take advantage of advances in technology, our privacy policy may change. Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.

If you have a Neiman Marcus credit card, a separate privacy policy describes collection, use, and protection of information about you and your account. To obtain a copy of our credit card privacy policy:

Neiman Marcus  
P.O. Box 720937  
Dallas, TX 75372-0937  The Information We Collect  


Whenever you shop with Horchow -- online, through our catalogs, or in our Horchow Finale stores -- we obtain from you the information we need to complete your transaction. This may include your name, address, telephone number, driver's license number, birth date, and e-mail address. If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, it will include your account number.

When you register with us as an online customer, we may ask for additional information, such as your preferences in decorating styles. 

If you use one of our services, or participate in one of our promotions or sweepstakes, we may ask for additional information, such as your age, interests or product preferences. 

From your purchases and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use.

To improve our Web site, we collect non-personal information about how users navigate through the site. This statistical information does not include individual names or personal data, so it does NOT identify you or any other customer. We may share this information with our affiliates or other outside companies. 

How We Use the Information We Collect  


We use the information we collect for various purposes, including: 

* to complete your purchase transactions;
* to provide the services you request;
* to send you our catalogs and other offerings by mail;
* to keep you informed about the status of your orders;
* to identify your product and service preferences, so we can notify you of new or additional 
* products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you;
* to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have 
* purchased; and
* to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall shopping experience.
Others With Whom We Share Your Information  


The Neiman Marcus Group: We may share the information we collect with our corporate affiliates, including the Neiman Marcus and Chef's catalogs and Web sites.

Service providers: We provide information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work with an outside company to manage a database of customer information or assist us in distributing e-mails.

Other companies: We may provide your information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.

Cookies and How We Use Them  


A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database.

We use cookies to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web site you visited immediately before clicking to Horchow.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.

Accepting cookies through your Web browser is your personal choice. You can still shop and purchase from Horchow.com even if you set your browser to disable cookies. 

Children's Privacy  


The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000. It imposes certain requirements on Web sites directed at children under 13 that collect information on those children, and on Web sites that knowingly collect information on children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 on our Web site, and our online sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old.

No one under the age of 15 should submit any personal information to this or any other Web site without the consent of a parent or guardian.

Links to Other Sites  


While visiting Horchow.com, you may link to Web sites operated by our business partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse these Web sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any Web site you may access through this Web site. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information or activities. You need to make your own independent decisions regarding your interactions or communications with any other Web site.

If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the Horchow privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information.

Online Account Registration  


To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with Horchow.com. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.

If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.

E-mails  


You will receive promotional e-mails from us only if you have asked to receive them. Each time you receive an e-mail from Horchow, you will be given the opportunity to "opt-out" or stop receiving them.

If you choose to "opt-out," we will stop sending you e-mails. Please note, however, that some e-mail promotions are prepared well in advance, so you may continue to receive offers after you have chosen to "opt-out." We appreciate your patience in giving us time to carry out your request.
