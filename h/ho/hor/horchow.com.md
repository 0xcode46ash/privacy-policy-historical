Security

 **The Neiman Marcus Group:** All of the above information that we collect, as described above, may be shared among all Neiman Marcus entities, including Horchow and Bergdorf Goodman.

**Service providers:** We also may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing e-mails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide us storage and analysis;(d) provide fraud prevention; and (e) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements. 

**Other companies:** We may provide information to carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you.

Your Choices Regarding Use of the Information We Collect

We provide you with a number of choices regarding our handling of your nonpublic personally identifiable information.

Direct Mail or Telephone Marketing: If you shop at the Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman stores and wish to be removed from the list of customers that receive direct mail or telemarketing calls, please either: 

  * call toll-free at 1.888-888-4757, or
  * write to:



Customer Relations  
P.O. Box 650589  
Dallas, TX 75265-0589 

If you choose to write to us, please include your name, address and credit card account number (if you have one), and state one of the following:

  * "NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by mail); 
  * "NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive offers by phone); or
  * "NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you don't want to receive either).



Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.

Please note that we do not offer an opt out from sharing nonpublic personally identifiable information about you among Neiman Marcus Group entities.

If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Neiman Marcus Customer Relations, P.O.Box 650589, Dallas, Texas 75265-0589. Please allow 30 days for a response.

Cookies, Web Beacons, and How We Use Them

A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. A "web beacon" or "pixel tag" or “clear gif” is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer to a website.

We use cookies and web beacons to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the Web Site as well as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web site you visited immediately before clicking to Horchow.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.

We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and web beacons and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners. However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services. If you would like to opt out of these services, please click here.

Children's Privacy

Protecting children's privacy is important to us. Our Web Site is a general audience site. We do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent's consent.

Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.

Links to Other Sites

While visiting Horchow.com, you may link to Web sites operated by our business partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse these Web sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any Web site you may access through this Web site. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information or activities.

In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other sites. If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the Neiman Marcus privacy policy. Make sure you understand any Web site's privacy policies before providing personal information.

Online Account Registration

To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with Horchow.com. As a registered customer, you only have to enter your shipping addresses and billing information once; they will be securely stored with us for your future use. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information.

If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.

E-mail

You will receive promotional e-mails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive email from Horchow or its affiliates you can click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us and then click the Unsubscribe button at the bottom of the page. Please allow us 3 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.

Protecting Yourself From Internet Scams

It should come as no surprise that one of our highest priorities at The Neiman Marcus Group is keeping your personal information secure and confidential. To that end, we would like to share some of the most common types of Internet scams and suggestions on how you can be aware of and help protect yourself against identity theft.

**Fictitious Job Offer Emails Alert**

Email campaigns offering fictitious job offers are a reality. The emails can be quite authentic looking. They often purport to have been sent directly from one of our executives or from our human resources department. Enclosures, such as company information sheets and detailed questionnaires, may display The Neiman Marcus Group logo or the logo of one of our divisions (Neiman Marcus, Horchow, Cusp, Last Call, or Bergdorf Goodman). The emails may include a request for payment of a processing fee of several hundred dollars, and/or they may offer reimbursement for certain job-application or relocation expenses.

These emails are fraudulent. The Neiman Marcus Group does not extend job offers via email to individuals with whom it has had no prior contact. We do not ask prospective employees to pay a fee to be considered for a position or to receive a job offer. We do not authorize recruiters or agents to do any of these things on our behalf. Fraudulent job offers are an unfortunate possibility. Please be aware, as we will not honor them in any way.

You should not respond to any of these job offers by revealing personal information, nor should you send any funds in response to them. If you receive one of these fraudulent offers, please report the matter to the U.S. Secret Service. You may also email our [security group](mailto:nmhc@neimanmarcus.com).

**Phishing And Spoofing Alert**

This is when a criminal sends you a phony message or a Website link that appears to be from a legitimate business. They will directly request that you provide personal financial information, such as:

  * Name and address
  * Social Security numbers
  * Credit card numbers/bank account numbers
  * Pin numbers/passwords



**Pop-Up Advertisements Alert**

Some advertisements "pop up" in a separate browser window advising that you have won a contest or request that you participate in a survey to collect a prize. They may then ask that you provide personal information in order to receive your gift. By clicking on the link it is possible that you are also downloading viruses designed to capture or destroy information on your computer.

**Check Scam Alert**

A similar but low-tech scam circulates occasionally, in the form of a check, purportedly from The Neiman Marcus Group or one of our divisions, and instructions to deposit it right away, usually in order to receive the balance of a larger sum you have "won" or that has otherwise come to you unexpectedly. You will be instructed to immediately send a payment, in the form of a second personal check, wire transfer, or similar, to some third party to cover taxes, processing fees, administrative costs, or some similarly vague expense. The check you receive in the mail likely would look quite authentic and probably would have our Neiman Marcus Group trademark on it. Do not deposit the check or follow the instructions you receive with it. The check you deposit will bounce; the check you write or funds you wire will clear, before you know about the bounce, and certainly before you can stop payment on your own check.

**Important Risk-Reducing Tips**

  * Never respond to emails that cannot be verified.
  * Never provide personal information via email.
  * Contact the business by using legitimate phone numbers to verify the request.
  * Enter Websites using your browser and not by clicking on provided links.
  * Be cautious of any solicitation requesting that you deposit a check or pay a fee to collect a prize, get a job, or cover vaguely described "costs".
  * Consider filing a report with the Federal Trade Commission and/or state attorney general’s consumer protection office, or the FBI. Online complaints may be filed with the FTC at [www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/), and white collar crimes may be reported to the FBI at [www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx](http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx).

Limited Warranty Questions and Answers

 **Question:** What is covered by the Horchow Furniture warranty?  
**Answer:** Every Furniture item Horchow sells is warranted against defects in material or workmanship. Furniture includes bedroom, upholstered and accent furniture, formal and casual dining, ready-to-assemble, and ready-to-finish. This warranty applies under condition of normal, indoor, household use and does not apply to damage resulting from misuse, accidents, or commercial usage.

**Question:** What is the length of time of the warranty?  
**Answer:** The warranty period is twelve (12) months from the date of delivery.

**Question:** To whom is the warranty extended?  
**Answer:** To the original purchaser or the person to whom original delivery was made by Horchow.

**Question:** What can I expect from Horchow?  
**Answer:** Horchow will determine whether the item under warranty should be repaired or replaced without charge. 

Horchow reserves the right to remove a defective item from your home for a reasonable period of time in order to make any necessary repairs either in our workshop or by return to the manufacturer.

In cases where Horchow determines a warranted item is defective and we can neither repair nor replace the item, our obligation will be limited to the return of the item for full refund, including delivery and processing.

**Question:** What about an item delivered damaged?  
**Answer:** The customer has the right to either refuse or to accept an item in damaged condition. A customer must report product delivered damaged to Horchow Customer Care at 1-877-944-9888 within five (5) business days of receipt. Customer will not be charged delivery and processing for items found to be damaged during delivery.

**Question:** Where will service be performed?  
**Answer:** If the item is determined to be repairable in-home, Horchow will make arrangements with you for this service. Otherwise, Horchow will arrange for pick-up at no charge to the customer. 

**Question:** What limitations and exclusions apply to the warranty?  
**Answer:** : This is your exclusive warranty, other than as provided by the manufacturer. Our products are not warranted against normal wear and tear, damage resulting from improper use, accidents, abuse, neglect, or damage or appearance changes resulting from improper care or storage. Our warranty does not cover product used in commercial non-residential settings. Minor variations in size, shape and color may occur from piece to piece. Our warranty does not cover such minor variations or differences between floor samples, swatches, or product images and your item(s). Any product modification other than by Horchow or the manufacturer voids this warranty. Horchow may change this warranty from time to time, so please review the warranty with each purchase.

Shipping Your Online Order

**Delivery & Processing Charges (D&P)**: D&P is the charge for catalog and internet order processing, item selection, packaging, processing, transport and handling. Special delivery requests, including specification of carrier and/or future delivery dates, may include additional charges. Delivery times are not guaranteed, notwithstanding additional charges, but are our best approximation and will vary with specific requests, such as gift packaging and monogramming. Shipments and deliveries occur only on weekdays. D&P is subject to change and will be determined at time of order and subject to the following:

_Standard Delivery_ \- Unless an expedited service is requested, your order should arrive in approximately 5-7 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST).

_Two-Day Delivery_ \- If requested, add $10.00 to standard D&P. Your order should arrive in 2 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST). Please note two-day orders placed after 12:00 noon (CST) Friday, or on Saturday or Sunday will be processed Monday and should arrive the next business days after shipping. Some heavy or bulky items may not qualify for this service. A signature may be required and additional charges may be assessed if more than one attempt is made for delivery. All zip codes are not available for this service.

_Overnight Delivery_ \- If requested, add $17.00 to standard D&P. Your order should arrive next business day after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST). Please note overnight orders placed after 12:00 noon (CST) Friday, or on Saturday or Sunday will be processed Monday and should arrive the next business day after shipping. Some heavy or bulky items may not qualify for this service. A signature may be required and additional charges may be assessed if more than one attempt is made for delivery. All zip codes are not available for this service.

_Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam Deliveries_ \- Add $5.00 to the applicable D&P charges. Your order should arrive in approximately 7 to 10 business days after shipping if ordered by 12:00 noon (CST).

_Furniture Delivery_ \- Most large pieces (determined by dimensions and weight), as well as certain items that require extensive assembly or setup, are delivered using our White Glove service. To find out if an item qualifies for this service, please call **1.877.944.9888**.

  * _What is White Glove service?_ The carrier brings the item into the room or area you specify (including up or down stairs), uncrates it, assembles it* (if necessary), positions it, and removes all shipping materials. 
  * _Is there a charge for White Glove service?_ The White Glove charge is included in the cost of additional shipping, specified with the item price on the website product page. 
  * _How is White Glove delivery scheduled?_ Our designated carrier for your area will contact you by telephone several days in advance to schedule a specific day and an estimated delivery time. White Glove delivery is not available on weekends or national holidays. 
  * _What is the process for returns?_ If the furniture arrives damaged or is damaged in the delivery/setup process, the carrier will re-crate and return it to Horchow at no charge to you. If it is returned for another reason, a pickup and/or restock fee may apply. 



_*Professional assembly is recommended for some of our merchandise and will be noted when you place your order. Assembly is included with delivery service only for items shipped to AZ, CA, CO, FL, GA, HI, IL, MA, MD, MI, MN, MO, NC, NJ, NV, NY, PA, TX, VA, WA, and the District of Columbia. For items shipped to states not listed here, assembly arrangements and expenses are the responsibility of the customer._

_International Deliveries_ \- At this time, it is not possible to specify international destinations and U.S. territories when placing an order online. However, you may have your Horchow.com purchase shipped to an international address by calling 1.972.556.6076. Duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the recipient. 

_Additional Address_ \- Please add $8.00 to the applicable D&P charges for each additional delivery address.

  * Items ordered together may be delivered separately, and the D&P will be allocated over shipments but not necessarily evenly. Some orders may require more than one package to ship; for these shipments the additional charge for two-day and overnight deliveries would be a per package charge.
  * Returns may affect final D&P charges. D&P charges are not refundable unless merchandise is damaged or defective. Returns for reasons due to Horchow will receive D&P credit as D&P was allocated, which may result in a final D&P charge after return that differs from quoted rates.
  * Orders of multiple items from different catalogs will result in D&P from the table in the most current catalog, as D&P tables may vary from catalog to catalog.
  * D&P may vary between catalog orders and internet orders.
  * D&P in parentheses by an item are in addition to standard D&P unless otherwise indicated.
  * Certain consumer commodities are considered hazardous materials, such as aerosols, nail polish, fragrances and other alcohol based products. Our policy is to ship these items as standard D&P to U.S. locations and to prohibit the shipping to international locations, including APO/FPO addresses, Puerto Rico and Guam.
  * If you request to change the destination address of a shipment en route, an additional charge may be assessed.

Payment Options

 **Gift Cards:** Horchow.com accepts both Horchow and Neiman Marcus Gift Cards - in both traditional and virtual forms - for online purchases.

  * If you are paying with more than one Gift Card, you cannot choose the amount to be deducted from each card. The balance due is deducted first from the card with the lowest available dollar value and then from remaining cards in ascending order of dollar value.
  * If your order total exceeds the value of your Gift Card(s), the balance remaining must be charged to a credit card (see below). Your credit card information can be entered on the Payment screen.
  * If your order total is less than the value of your Gift Card(s), the unused value will remain on the card for a future purchase.
  * If you cancel your order after it has been shipped, or if you return the merchandise, a refund check will be mailed to you.
