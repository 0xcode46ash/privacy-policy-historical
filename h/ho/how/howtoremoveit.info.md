## Website logs

All requests to the Ad-blocker.org website are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address, the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page. This data is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics remain. 

## Uninstallation page feedback

After uninstalling Ad-blocker, you may be directed to a webpage that asks for your feedback. The webpage stores some application and platform related data anonymously. If you decide to submit feedback, we will also store it anonymously. 

## Stored IP addresses

Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the ad-blocker.org domain. The data transmitted includes the Ad-Blocker version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to the usual ad-blocker.org privacy policy. 

## Issue reporter

Ad-blocker allows you to send issue reports that will be temporarily stored on the Ad-blocker.org domain. These reports contain information required to investigate the issue including the Ad-blocker version, browser version, address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page, matching filters and active subscriptions. Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information. It is also possible to provide additional information, which may be privacy-sensitive: 

  * A website screenshot provides a scaled-down and color-reduced version of the page viewed. It is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before the report is sent.

  * The email address is only used to request more information or to update the user on the issue.

  * A list of installed extensions is necessary for the investigation of conflicts with other extensions.




The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique address. These addresses are only shared with the maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in the report and are unlikely to be found by others unless a link is provided. All reports and their associated data are automatically removed after 30 days.
