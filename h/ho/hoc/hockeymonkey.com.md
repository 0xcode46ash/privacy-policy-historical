**The Yahoo! Shopping Merchant Rating system:**  
  
What is the Yahoo! Merchant rating system? The rating system guarantees that the merchants you deal with provide superior customer service. Anyone that does not provide consistently good customer service is not allowed to be a Yahoo! Shopping store. Yahoo! Shopping takes this rating system very seriously. 

The "Top Service" 5-Star logo next to a store's name is a sign of superlative quality.It means that the store is participating in our Customer Rating Program, and that customers who have ordered from that store have given it the highest ratings. Nearly all Yahoo! stores have good customer satisfaction ratings, but those with 5 stars are the best of the best, with at least 95% positive ratings.

**Hockey Monkey is proud to be a 5 star "Top Service" merchant. Our customer satisfaction is consistently above the average for all of Yahoo! Shopping.**  
  
**How are merchants rated?**  
---  
The Merchant Rating System is an integral part of Yahoo!'s program to guarantee a positive, high-quality online shopping experience. The rating system gathers feedback from shoppers about Yahoo! Shopping merchants and then uses the feedback to determine an overall rating for that merchant. The system is weighted so that the merchant's overall rating reflects the majority of customer ratings. If most customers rate the store positively, the rating will reflect this. The overall rating is displayed next to the store name whenever it appears in the Yahoo! Shopping pages.

**Be a smart Yahoo! Shopper...**  
Use merchant ratings to make more informed purchasing decisions. And, after you place an order, contribute your feedback by filling out a merchant evaluation form.

 ** The Hockey Monkey mission:** **  
Provide superior customer service, unparalleled selection, at unbeatable prices!!**  
The superior customer service of Hockey Monkey and the peace of mind offered by Yahoo! Shopping is your guarantee that your online shopping experience with Hockey Monkey will be a safe, secure, and pleasant one!
