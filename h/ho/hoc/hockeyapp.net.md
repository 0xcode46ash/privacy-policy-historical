# HockeyApp - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Bit Stadium we have a few fundamental principles: 

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.
  * We don’t share your data with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * We utilizes SSL throughout the entire domain [rink.hockeyapp.net](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/). Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology encrypts all data transferred between your computer and our servers. Your data is for your eyes only.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact our [support@hockeyapp.net](mailto:support@hockeyapp.net).

Bit Stadium GmbH, (" _Bit Stadium_ ") operates several websites including [rink.hockeyapp.net](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/) and [www.hockeyapp.net](http://www.hockeyapp.net/). It is Bit Stadium's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Bit Stadium collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bit Stadium’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bit Stadium’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Bit Stadium may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Bit Stadium’s websites choose to interact with Bit Stadium in ways that require Bit Stadium to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Bit Stadium gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to [HockeyApp](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/) to provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Bit Stadium – by purchasing access to the paid plans, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Bit Stadium collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Bit Stadium. Bit Stadium does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### User and Device Statistics

Bit Stadium may display the following information to logged-in users, if they are owner, developer or team member of an app: 

  * First name and last name of all team members
  * UDID, device type, version and language of all devices in the provisioning profile or of all team members
  * UDID, device type, version and language of all devices which have installed the app
  * Numbers of downloads and installations of the app or version
  * Usage time of the app or version
  * Crash logs



All client SDKs are open-source and can be modified by the developer of an app to control which data is sent to HockeyApp.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Bit Stadium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Bit Stadium’s behalf or to provide services available at Bit Stadium’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Bit Stadium’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Bit Stadium will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Bit Stadium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Bit Stadium believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Bit Stadium, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Bit Stadium website and have supplied your email address, Bit Stadium may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Bit Stadium and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Bit Stadium takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Bit Stadium uses cookies to help Bit Stadium identify and track visitors, their usage of Bit Stadium website, and their website access preferences. Bit Stadium visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Bit Stadium’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Bit Stadium’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Bit Stadium may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Bit Stadium’s sole discretion. Bit Stadium will notify all registered users by email on a privacy policy change.
