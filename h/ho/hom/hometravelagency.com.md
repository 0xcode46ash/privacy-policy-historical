We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use email addresses collected when you subscribe to our newsletter to send the newsletter to you. We use email addresses collected when you request information via an autoresponder (such as our "Mini-Course for Home-Based Travel Agents") to send the requested information.  


We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. 

We reserve the right to use such addresses to provide you with occasional notices of new products and special offers. You may elect not to receive additional emails of this nature at any time by requesting that your email addresses be removed from our records.

Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.   


We reserve the right to use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.
