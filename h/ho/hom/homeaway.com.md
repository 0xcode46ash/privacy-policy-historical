# Vacation Rentals, Vacation Accommodations, Condo Rentals

HomeAway.com is serious about protecting the privacy of our owners and our renting visitors. We use information collected about you only to process and bill orders and to make our website a more useful and valuable service. We respect the privacy of those who visit or become advertisers. Our privacy policy is listed below, but please be aware that should you follow a link on our website to another website, you no longer are covered by this policy. Itâ€™s a good idea to understand the privacy policy of any website before sharing personal information with it.   
**  
Your Information: What, How, and Why?**

**Property Owners/Advertisers and Vacation Planning Visitors**

In order to process a request you may have of us we need to know contact information that could include all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of an advertising listing, a method of payment. HomeAway will use this information to contact you from time to time with critical customer updates and information, or to send you information about new services or opportunities. You will be able to "opt out" and not receive marketing information, but we must always be able to email you critical information about your account and our mutual business relationship. 

Your information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in the case of special promotions by HomeAway, or one of its partners, about which you've requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs services on behalf of HomeAway and has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the conduct of an online survey for example); and 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple HomeAway advertisers and visitors where individual personal information is not disclosed. HomeAway shares Website usage information about advertisers and visitors with a third-party tracking company for the purpose of reporting statistics. For this purpose, some of the pages you visit on our Website use pixel tags (also called clear gifs). HomeAway also uses your information to market its services and to gain feedback on potential new services. 

**Newsletters**  
As an advertiser or visitor to HomeAway, you will receive either or both of our Owner or Traveler newsletters. You may cancel your subscription to these newsletters at any time. 

**Surveys**  
Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our visitors. From time to time, we request lister or newsletter subscribers' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service. 

**Inquiries**  
Site visitors may send inquiries to our property owners/advertisers via clickable links on HomeAway listings. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your email address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the owner of the property you inquired about so that they might reply directly to you. Do not share information in the email that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are sent to both the individual owner/advertiser you selected and retained by HomeAway.com. The resulting inquiry is available for review only by the owner/advertiser to whom they were initially addressed and to HomeAway customer service employees, who may be asked by advertisers for their past inquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, HomeAway may, from time to time, use third party email servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry emails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage via these third party tracking systems.

All inquiries sent through HomeAway are accepted and are governed by our Terms and Conditions of Service and our Privacy Policy.

**How Do We Protect Subscriber Information Once We Have It?**  
All personal information is stored on a secure server; however, we do not store credit card numbers or identifying information on an HomeAway.com server. All such information is stored by Paradata, our credit card processing partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its proprietary methods.

Please remember that many services and transactions are performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our security or common practices do not apply to other companies. 

**What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. HomeAway.com may uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits. Cookies allow us to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site can be more personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Websites in much the same way we use them here at HomeAway.com. 

We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your Website visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of serving our pages, these third parties may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to HomeAway.com and other Websites in order to help us understand how to serve you better. 

By using our Website and signing up for HomeAway.com services, you consent to the collection and use of the previously mentioned information by HomeAway.com and our affiliates. This policy is subject to change without notice. Privacy issues represent a growing concern for all Web users. To keep up-to-date with our policies, please check this page frequently. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. 

**What information do we share with Rentors.org?**  
HomeAway is a founding member of Rentors.org. Many of our subscribers have pre-existing relationships with Rentors.org, which provides services to property owners including but not limited to the universal calendar and guestbook. 

If you wish to use our calendar, you must be a member of 

Rentors.org. In order to make this easy for you, we share information, such as your name and your property ID with Rentors.org so that updates you make to your calendar while on HomeAway will update the calendar you have on Rentors.org or on the other websites where you have posted your Rentors.org calendar. You do not need to register with Rentors.org, because we pass only the information Rentors.org requires through to them so that they can properly update calendars and guest books as they change from time to time.
