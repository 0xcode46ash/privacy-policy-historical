We use your contact information and preferences to keep you up to date on product announcements, offers, science teaching tips, company news, and other information we think you'd like to learn about. When you request information about a product, a customer service representative will contact you to follow-up on your inquiry. We may also use your personal information to contact you about participating in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.

**How we collect personal information**  
We might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register on our web site, request a product catalog, ask a question of our Frequently Asked Question database, or participate in an online survey. When you ask to be included in an email mailing list, such as subscribing to our company newsletter, we also collect your personal information.

To save you time and make our web services easier to use, we may make your personal information accessible to multiple web sites operated by Home SCience Tools. That means that if you register with one web site, you can sign-in to all web sites operated by Home Science Tools. Changes made to your contact information or personal preferences from any of our sites will result in a change being made to our centralized, secure, customer database.

**When we disclose personal information**  
Your personal information may be shared within the Home Science Tools organization, including with our customer service representatives. These customer service representatives will protect your personal information in accordance with this Home Science Tools Customer Privacy Policy.

With your permission, we may refer you to other independent organizations that can provide you a complementary or superior product or service.

Home Science Tools works with other companies that help us provide you with products and services. We may provide your contact information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only.

**Home Science Tools will not share your contact information nor personal preferences with organizations outside of our company for the purpose of soliciting you for promotional reasons.**

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information.

**How we protect your personal information**  
Home Science Tools safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and internal management procedures.

Home Science Tools does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.

The Home Science Tools Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
