HometownQuotes Privacy Policy  
  
At HometownQuotes.com, we value your privacy. You trust us and our members to serve your insurance needs and we take this responsibility very seriously. Our privacy policy is simple: HometownQuotes.com and its affiliates respect your right to confidentiality and do not share your personally identifiable information unless it is at your request to carry out a transaction or provide a service, with your authorization, or as permitted by law. Even in that case, when you submit information to HometownQuotes.com, you authorize us to share this information only with the qualified network of HometownQuotes.com agents to provide you with your quotes. Accordingly, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private.

By submitting the information you are asked for, you are authorizing the recipients of your information (the agents) to use it in a manner deemed necessary to provide you with an accurate quote on your insurance. 

By submitting a form with your telephone number you are consenting for HometownQuotes.com and all authorized agents to contact you even if your name is on a Federal or State "Do Not Call List".

You agree and acknowledge that HometownQuotes.com is in the business of matching people with insurance quotes and that by submitting your personal information to HometownQuotes.com, you are requesting an insurance quote.  In order to provide you with insurance quotes, you authorize HometownQuotes.com to provide your information to local and national insurance agents and to third party agent networks. Therefore, you authorize those insurance agents to contact you by phone and email, and expressly authorize those insurance agents to contact you by phone even if your name appears on the National Do Not Call Registry or any State “Do Not Call” registries.  

HometownQuotes.com may notify you of special promotions offered by the insurance agents and underwriters in our network or related service providers. No personal information about you will be supplied to the promotion sponsors unless you express an interest in the offer by e-mail or by phone. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed from e-mail promotion lists at any time.

**Confidentiality and Security**

Since specific information is required in order to utilize HometownQuotes.com's search capabilities, securing your privacy is our first priority. That's why HometownQuotes.com is designed with the most advanced technology and security measures. HometownQuotes.com has established safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information. Furthermore, we will honor this commitment with respect to information we have in our possession even after you have been placed in contact with a member of our network.

Data transmitted through HometownQuotes.com – including all personal information you submit - is protected using 1024-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to make your connection to our server completely confidential.

SSL technology ensures that only you, HometownQuotes.com and our insurance agents and underwriters - upon your authorization - can access the information you submit. The data you provide is immediately translated into code, and can only be decoded by HometownQuotes.com. SSL confirms the identity of the originating computer terminal and the recipient terminal, preventing unauthorized interception.
