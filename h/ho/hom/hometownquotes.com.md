HometownQuotes Privacy Policy  
  
At HometownQuotes.Com, we value your privacy. You trust us and our members to serve your insurance needs and we take this responsibility very seriously. Our privacy policy is simple: HometownQuotes.Com and its affiliates respect your right to confidentiality and do not share your personally identifiable information unless it is at your request to carry out a transaction or provide a service, with your authorization, or as permitted by law. Even in that case, when you submit information to HometownQuotes.Com, you authorize us to share this information only with the qualified network of HometownQuotes.Com agents to provide you with your quotes. Accordingly, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private.

By submitting the information you are asked for, you are authorizing the recipients of your information (the agents) to use it in a manner deemed necessary to provide you with an accurate quote on your insurance. 

By submitting a form with your telephone number you are consenting for HometownQuotes.Com and all authorized agents to contact you even if your name is on a Federal or State "Do not call List".

HometownQuotes.Com may notify you of special promotions offered by the insurance agents and underwriters in our network or related service providers. No personal information about you will be supplied to the promotion sponsors unless you express an interest in the offer by e-mail or by phone. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed from e-mail promotion lists at any time.

**Confidentiality and Security**  
Since specific information is required in order to utilize HometownQuotes.Com's search capabilities, securing your privacy is our first priority. That's why HometownQuotes.Com is designed with the most advanced technology and security measures. HometownQuotes.Com has established safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information. Furthermore, we will honor this commitment with respect to information we have in our possession even after you have been placed in contact with a member of our network.

Data transmitted through HometownQuotes.Com - including all personal information you submit - is protected using 1024-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to make your connection to our server completely confidential.

SSL technology ensures that only you, HometownQuotes.Com and our insurance agents and underwriters - upon your authorization - can access the information you submit. The data you provide is immediately translated into code, and can only be decoded by HometownQuotes.Com. SSL confirms the identity of the originating computer terminal and the recipient terminal, preventing unauthorized interception.

**HometownQuotes.Com's Commitment to Fair Information Practices**

We are committed to fair information practices in e-commerce. We freely disclose our privacy policies to every HometownQuotes.Com user and our participating agents and underwriters, and continually evaluate our practices and the latest technologies to ensure our users and network the highest level of security and protection of privacy.

**Terms and Conditions**

By submitting a quote request, you authorize HometownQuotes to provide your information to insurance agents, both local and national. You also authorize HometownQuotes to provide your information to one of our third party agent networks in the event that our primary agent network has few or no agents in your zip code. You authorize these agent networks to share your information with their vendors, suppliers, and insurance carriers in order to generate information for your quotes. By submitting a quote request, you acknowledge that HometownQuotes’ service requires you to agree that our partner companies may obtain a consumer report or credit score from a consumer reporting agency (also known as a credit bureau) and that these partner companies do not have the right to obtain a consumer report or credit score without your written instruction which you are granting by clicking the submit button. Accordingly, by submitting a quote request you instruct consumer reporting agencies to provide a consumer report or credit score on you to these partner companies if requested within a reasonable date from the time you submit information to HometownQuotes. In the event that one of our partner companies obtains this credit information that partner company will not share this information with any other party, including insurance carriers, but insurance carriers may elect to obtain credit information on their own in connection with the quoting and underwriting of the requested insurance. Where permitted by law, some insurance companies or their agents may confirm your information, through the use of consumer reports, which may include credit score and driving record.

By clicking submit and seeking a quote request I authorize and agree that up to eight insurance companies or their agents and partners companies may contact me using this information or to obtain additional information needed to provide quotes where permitted by law. Insurance companies or their agents that receive a quote request from this website or its partner companies may confirm my information through the use of a consumer report, which may include my credit score and driving record. I authorize and instruct this website and its partner companies to obtain a consumer report. I acknowledge that I have read and understand all of the Terms and Conditions of this website and agree to be bound by them
