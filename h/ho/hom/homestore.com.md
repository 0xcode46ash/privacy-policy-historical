# Homestore: Privacy Policy

    |  **Privacy Policy**   
Last updated 10-5-2000

HOMESTORE.COM™ TAKES YOUR PRIVACY SERIOUSLY. Please read the following to learn more  about our privacy policy. This privacy policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back  frequently. 

[Click here](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html) for information on Internet safety and security from the Federal Trade Commission. 

The Homestore.com family of sites, including but not limited to Homestore.com, REALTOR.com®,  HomeBuilder.com™, Homestore.com™ apartments & rentals, Remodel.com™, CommercialSource.com™, and  HomeFair.com™, is committed to your privacy and security and wants to provide you with the best  possible online experience. To that end, we want you to understand what kinds of information we gather  from you, how this information is used and safeguarded, and how you can control its use. 

**  
What information is collected from me?**

The kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending on how you use our Web sites. It’s  possible to browse our sites without submitting any personally identifiable information (“personal  information”) at all, but if you choose to take advantage of some of our products and services, you may  be asked to provide information such as a user name and password, your real name, e-mail address,  phone number, address, or—for certain financial products or services—your Social Security number  and banking information, and—for certain e-commerce transactions—your credit card information.  Whenever we ask for this kind of information, we strive to provide a link to this Privacy Policy to help  you understand how your personal information will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. 

In addition to the information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain  anonymous data to help us better understand how our sites are being used and how we can improve  them. This automatically gathered data includes your computer’s IP or “Internet Protocol” address,  statistics about how visitors navigate through our sites, and information provided through the use of  “cookies” (which are described in more detail below). 

Finally, as you visit our sites, be aware that third parties may at times be able to gather information  from you. For example, third-party ad servers and companies that place ads on our sites may use their own cookies, and companies offering products or services through a Homestore.com Web site may  use their own cookies and may collect and use the information you submit. In these cases, the third  parties would use your information according to their own policies which may differ from this Privacy  Policy. 

**How is my information used?**

The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected. Therefore, pay special  attention to the categories below that relate to the features of our sites that you wish to utilize. Also be  aware that Homestore.com may at times be legally compelled to disclose certain information, by  means such as subpoenas or court orders. 

**Cookies:** These are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we may recognize it  as a unique machine the next time you visit our sites. Our cookies are used for three reasons: (1) to   keep track of your information for your own convenience; (2) to help us optimize your online  experience by altering our content depending on your particular needs or browsing patterns, and to provide you with advertisements, products, and services of interest to you; and (3) to help us  understand the size of our audience and their traffic patterns within our network. Some of our  advertisers and third-party ad servers may also utilize their own cookies. Also, companies offering  products or services through a Homestore.com Web site may use their own cookies. 

**Registration:** The information you provide when you become a registered user of one of our sites is  used primarily to help us customize your online experience. This information may also be shared  among the various Web sites in the Homestore.com family to make your use of each site more  convenient without having to register more often than necessary. Your e-mail address serves as a  unique identifier in our record system, and it is used together with your password to prevent  unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on our sites. The data you give us about  your personal preferences and demographics (such as age, ZIP code, occupation, or other data) may be  used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that are most likely to appeal to  you. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their ads more effectively. Please note that we do not  accept or store registration for anyone under the age of 13 under any circumstances. 

  * Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the e-mail address you  provide at registration to contact you for promotional, administrative, or other reasons. You may  have these communications terminated at any time. If you indicate that you’re interested in  hearing from other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose. 



**Tools:** Our sites allow you to use many helpful tools, such as financial and home improvement  calculators, real estate search tools, and others, without disclosing any personal information. These  tools are for your benefit, and the information you submit when you use them (typically impersonal  data) is not disclosed to anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide you with the service  you’re seeking. 

**User-Requested Services:** You may choose to request products or services of a more substantial or  personal nature when using our Web sites. For example, you may apply for a loan, request our help in  locating a remodeling contractor, store your preferences for convenience in using our sites, or make an  online purchase. The information you provide when seeking these services may be used in the  following ways: 

  * For services provided by a Homestore.com Web site, the information you submit is used by us to  provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share this information with subcontractors, but  only to the extent necessary to fulfill your request. In addition, we may use the contact  information and nonfinancial order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address, as  set out in the Registration section, above. For tools on HomeFair, we may, with your permission,  contact you by phone to request additional information to help you find useful services. You are  not required to cooperate with any telephone requests by HomeFair. If the service you request requires submission of financial information, such as a credit card number for an online purchase,  rest assured that this financial information is used only for processing your payment, and is not  retained after completion of your order. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order  information for accounting purposes and to help us understand your preferences better, so we can  offer you future products or services that you may find useful. 
  * For products and services offered to you jointly by Homestore.com and a third party, your  information may be shared with or independently gathered by the third party. In these situations,  Homestore.com will only use your personal information as it would as if offering the product or  service by itself, but the third party may use the information in different ways. You can tell when  a product or service is offered by a third party, because that page of our Web site will be  “cobranded,” displaying the third party’s logo or name along with our own, or you will be linked  to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do  business with has its own policies regarding the use and protection of your information which may  differ from those outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal  information might be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you to become familiar  with that company’s privacy policy before using the service or requesting the product, or to not request the particular product or service. 
  * From time to time, we may wish to use personal information you provide when requesting a  product or service for purposes beyond those listed above. If this is the case, you will always be  notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the personal information, and you’ll be  given a chance to "opt out" of that use or to not complete the request for the particular product or  service. 



**Solicited Information:** You may occasionally see contests, surveys, and other features of our Web  sites that ask you to provide us with information. When you choose to respond to these requests, the  information you offer may be used for several reasons. These include the uses set out in the  Registration section, above. They also include providing information to third parties as necessary for  prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering. If we are going to use your  personal information for any other purposes, we will notify you of that purpose and give you a chance  to opt out before responding to our survey, contest form, or other request, or to not respond to or participate in the survey, contest or other request. 

**User-Initiated Communication:** Our Web sites enable you to send e-mail to us or to third parties, and  to participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. Whenever you choose to initiate these  kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may expect to be contacted in return. Also  remember that our bulletin boards and discussion groups are open to the public—what you post there can be seen by anyone and is not protected by Homestore.com. Please use your own discretion when  deciding what to post publicly and whom to contact. 

**Referrals:** If you participate in any referral service we may offer, we will use the information you  submit to determine which of our participating professionals may be able to serve your needs. We may  then forward your name, contact information, and other responses to our sign-up form to the selected  professional(s), who may then contact you using that information. Any information that you provide may also be used by us in accordance with the uses set out in the Registration section, above. 

**Automatically Gathered Data:** The information gathered automatically by our system—such as your  computer’s IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, and a record of your navigation through our  site—may be used by Homestore.com so we can understand how to make our sites convenient and  useful to our audience. This information may also be shared among the various Web sites in the  Homestore.com family and used for similar purposes. In addition, we may share this information, in  aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their ads  more effectively. 

**Collected Data:** We may link information collected from you through various means, including  information collected automatically and through the use of cookies and registration information, or other personal information you provide to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services  that are most likely to appeal to you, and this information may also be shared among the various Web sites in the Homestore.com family. In addition, we may share this information, in  aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their ads  more effectively. If you have indicated that you want to be contacted by third parties, we may use  this information to select which names to provide to a particular third party in order to present you with  products and services that are most likely to appeal to you, but we will not disclose this type of  information, other than your contact information, to any such third party. 

**What choices do I have regarding the use of my information?**

  * Reading this Privacy Policy should help you understand how any information you share with us might  be used. If you feel concerned about any of these uses, you might elect not to participate in certain  services, features, or products that we offer. We will never collect personal information about you  without your knowledge, so the decision whether or not to share this information is completely up to  you. 



**How do I "opt-out"?**

  * You also have the ability to terminate e-mail correspondence from us at any time. You will either be  given the chance to opt out of direct mailings when you disclose your e-mail address to us, you can  simply reply to our e-mail, typing “Unsubscribe” in the subject line or e-mail the appropriate Web  master below with your request, and we will promptly remove your address from that e-mail service:  [Privacy@Homestore.com](mailto:Webmaster@Homestore.com). 
  * If you feel concerned about the cookies that are sent between our computers and yours, you may, through your Web browser, either choose to reject them automatically, or have your computer prompt  you before accepting them. Generally this is done by selecting the appropriate cookies setting on your  Web browser, usually found in “Internet Options” or “Preferences.” Please note, however, that some  of our features and services depend on the use of cookies. Therefore, you will be unable to take  advantage of those features if you choose not to accept cookies. 



**How can I access and change my information?**

  * To view, edit, or delete the personal information you submitted at one of our sites during registration  or elsewhere as described above, follow the instructions found in the “My Profile” or “Edit Your  Profile” area of the site where you registered. If you would like us to delete the personal information  we may gather from you in the other areas described above, please send a request to  [Privacy@Homestore.com.](mailto:Privacy@Homestore.com)



**How is my information protected?**

  * Whenever personal information about you is stored on our computers, that information is password-protected from unauthorized access or use. In addition, this information is kept only on servers that are  located behind a “firewall,” which makes their contents inaccessible to outside users. 
  * Since your Social Security and financial information is especially sensitive, we take special care to  keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask for this information over secure Internet connections,  using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption—the currently accepted standard for online security—and security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third parties you’ve authorized to receive this information. Finally, your Social Security number, credit card number, and  financial information are never stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this  information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra effort. 
  * Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and others’ privacy. We  hope you’ll use common sense whenever you disclose personal information over the Internet. Just as  importantly, we encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that the information you  share with us is being used in any way contrary to this Privacy Policy. To contact us, send e-mail to  [Webmaster@Homestore.com](mailto:Webmaster@homestore.com.). 



**Scope of This Privacy Policy: Outside Links**

  * This Privacy Policy only applies to Web sites owned or operated by Homestore.com. Our pages  contain links to sites outside our control. Please be aware that these sites may collect information  about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices which may differ from this Privacy  Policy. Remember that once you’re outside our family of Web sites, any information you submit is  outside of our control.
