### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed on the hard drive of a visitor's computer. We use cookies for several purposes, such as: 

  * to provide better service and a more effective Web site, 
  * to facilitate interaction with visitors' browsers, 
  * to collect non-personally identifiable data, 
  * to recognize visitors when they return to fanniemae.com or eFannieMae.com, and, 
  * to enable visitors to save data to view later. To view stored data at a later time, however, visitors must generally access fanniemae.com or eFannieMae.com from the same personal computer that they used to provide the data. 



Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies to store information.

### Advertising

Fannie Mae may use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files may be provided by a contractor, such as an advertiser or agency, or service provider working with us. These files enable us to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements visitors to our Web site see. The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.

### Security

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of visitors' personally identifiable information.
