When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, a password that you select, and optionally, your interests. Your registration information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.

#### Personal Information Disclosure:

The Home Depot will not trade, rent or sell your personal information, without your prior consent, except as otherwise set out herein.

We encourage you to review each Service Provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for such services.

#### Companies that Work with or on Behalf of The Home Depot:

Some of our operations, such as our call centres and the employment application section of any of our Sites, may be managed by our Canadian, US and foreign Service Providers. Also, if you purchase installation services from The Home Depot, these services may not be provided by The Home Depot Associates, but rather by reputable local or national Service Providers with which we contract to provide such services. These Service Providers may have access to your personal information on a confidential basis to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will these companies have the right to use your personal information for any reason other than to provide you with those specific services, except as may be permitted by law. Information provided by you will be used by The Home Depot and its Service Providers to learn about the experiences of our customers so that we may enhance our programs and improve our level of service. For further information on the manner in which our service providers process your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer as set out under the "How to Contact Us" section below.

If your purchases are being shipped to you, we will share your shipping information on a confidential basis with our delivery Service Providers (U.S. Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select). Our delivery Service Providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than making the delivery.

#### Sale of Business:

#### Legal:

Please note that The Home Depot and our Service Providers must provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by law.

Your personal information may be maintained and processed on our behalf by Home Depot US and our Service Providers who may be required to disclose information in accordance with applicable US or other foreign laws.

### Additional Information about our Sites

#### Visiting our Sites:

In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.

#### Cookies:

Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.

#### Tracer Tags:

Our Sites may also use a technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our Sites. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other future website visitors.

#### Third Party Links:

Our Sites may include links to the websites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your prior consent. 

The Home Depot provides links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. The inclusion of any link does not imply Home Depot's endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information.

### Security of Personal Information

We will maintain the confidentiality of all personal information collected in our Stores, our Call Centres, our Sites and from our Service Providers and will only transfer such information to employees of The Home Depot, The Home Depot US, and our Canadian, US and other foreign Service Providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control. We maintain your personal information for as long as required for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

### Security Measures on our Sites

#### Secure Shopping:

When you place orders on our Sites, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Sites from capturing and viewing your personal information. 

The Home Depot also takes the following measures to protect your personal information online:

#### Passwords:

To provide you with an increased level of security, online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. The Home Depot will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (including unsolicited correspondence such as letters, phone calls or email messages).

#### Order Information:

Since any order information you provide to us on our Sites will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Sites. The most recent versions of Netscape NavigatorTM and Microsoft Internet Explorer® can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Netscape and Microsoft website respectively.

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, The Home Depot cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites. 

### Who We Are

The Home Depot is comprised of a family of companies and divisions brought together to provide you with a full suite of home or office improvement products and services.
