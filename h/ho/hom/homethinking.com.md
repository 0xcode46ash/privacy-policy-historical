##### Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve the overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.

We may also use an ad network provider or providers to help present advertisements on this and other web sites. The ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.

Such aggregate information is not linked to any personally identifiable information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

##### Disclosure

To the extent that you provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not provide or sell your Information to any other company or organization. We may transfer your Information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Homethinking LLC participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Homethinking LLC assets.
