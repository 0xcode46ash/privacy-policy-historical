## Buchanan Group Privacy Policy

**Buchanan Advertising (Australia) Pty Ltd.** ( **Buchanan** or **We/we** or **Our/our** or **Us/us** ) is committed to respecting the privacy of your personal information.  
This Privacy Policy explains our policy for dealing with personal information that we collect through our website www.brandpower.com , any related **Buchanan** **w** ebsite, social media page, internal website, intranet and any **Buchanan** mobile applications (each, a “ **Website** ”) and the privacy of individuals who provide personal information by any other means to **Buchanan** , including either physically or electronically including via completion of surveys (together, the “ **Collection Channels** ”).  
You may contact us with any queries you may have in respect of this Privacy Policy or your personal information by contacting **Buchanan’s privacy officer** via email: [privacy@buchanangroup.com](mailto:privacy@buchanangroup.com) or telephone: +61 (0)3 9644 0000. 

**Personal information is important to Buchanan**

  1. **Buchanan** is committed to safeguarding personal privacy. It recognises that you have a right to control how your personal information is collected and used. Providing personal information is an act of trust and it is taken seriously. Unless given consent to do otherwise, **Buchanan** will only collect and use personal information as set out below. 
  2. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we refer to your 'personal information', which means information which identifies you as an individual or which renders you reasonably identifiable. Your full name, gender, date of birth, home address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, email address and workplace contact details are examples of information which may constitute personal information. Personal information may also include information we may collect about your individual preferences.
  3. **Buchanan** has developed and implemented its Privacy Policy with respect to personal information to reflect world best practice on privacy policies. These principles meet and exceed the requirements of the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) (as amended) and the 13 Australian Privacy Principles.
  4. In order to keep up with changing legislation and best practice, we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Websites, so we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy from time to time.
  5. In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, there may also be specific and additional privacy and consent provisions that apply to certain Collection Channels. Because those specific and additional provisions also relate to your privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail. 



**Anonymity and pseudonymity**

  6. Where practicable, we will allow you to deal with us on an anonymous or pseudonymous basis. If this is practicable, our Collection Channels will only seek information in this way. However, where it is not practicable for the purposes for which information is collected, we will seek the information identified below.



**Kinds of Personal Information that Buchanan Collects and Holds**

  7. Personal information that may be requested includes:


    1. contact information such as your full name, date of birth, telephone number, mobile telephone number, current and valid email address, residential address and postcode; 
    2. more detailed contact preferences, information regarding your interests and information about your experience with our products or services or third party products or services listed on a Website. This information is requested in order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services; 
    3. the contact details of third parties. If you are asked to provide details about other people, please ensure that these individuals are happy for their details to be given to **Buchanan** and used for the purposes set out in this policy. Buchanan will not use the contact details of third parties for marketing purposes without their consent..



**How Buchanan Collects and Holds Personal Information**

  8. **Buchanan** **will only collect or monitor any personal information about you with your consent including as provided in this Privacy Policy or if it is otherwise lawful to do so. The only personal information collected by us is what has been provided to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy or has been provided to us lawfully by third parties.**



**Active Information Collection**

  9. Personal information may be collected (and combined) via our Collection Channels if you:
    1. have previously provided us with personal information prior to this Privacy Policy coming into effect, either directly from you personally or via a third party;
    2. sign-up and/or register to become a member of any Collection Channel;
    3. purchase a product or make a booking via a Collection Channel;

    9. interact with a Website for a specific purpose; or
    10. interact with or browse a Website generally. 
  10. Personal information is requested in order to facilitate or provide you with certain content, products or services, and information about such content, products or services (including the uploading, access to, and receipt of content on a Website, targeted product trials and purchase transactions undertaken on a Website), marketing materials, newsletters, electronic newsletters (e-newsletters), news and media releases / launch information, and also to advise you of other **Buchanan or third party products,** services, offers, competitions or events which may be of interest. No one is obligated to provide personal information. However, failure to do so may result in **Buchanan** being unable to facilitate or provide you with certain content, products or services, products or services information, upcoming promotion, competition, offer or event information or accept competition entries (where applicable). 
  11. We may also obtain your personal information from legitimate third party sources including list brokers and other data providers or organisations that share data in circumstances where it is lawful and/or you have given permission for them to do so. 



**Children**

  12. **Buchanan** is neither intended for, nor directed to, persons who are under the age of fifteen (15) years old . Personal information will not be collected by any person who is known by Buch **anan** to be under the age of fifteen (15) without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Persons under age fifteen (15) may only use **our Websites** with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. 



**Passive Information Collection**

  13. As with many commercial websites, we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to our Websites. For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of a Website are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where a Website is accessed via links in an email we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user accessing a Website. By accessing a Website via links in an email we have sent and/or by accessing a Website generally, you consent to the collection of such information where it is personal information. 
  14. As you navigate through our Websites, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as Unique Device Identifiers ( **UDI** ), cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). In certain circumstances, this information may be considered anonymous information, or personal information under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth). This is dependent on the device used and the method by which an individual connects to the Internet. Your Internet browser automatically transmits to the Website you are browsing some of this anonymous information or personal information, such as the URL of the website you just came from, the Internet Protocol ( **IP** ) address, the UDI (if applicable) and the browser version your device is currently using. Our Websites may also collect anonymous information or personal information from your device through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of a Website might not work without cookies and this may limit the services provided by a Website. Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf. 
  15. Our Websites may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information or personal information from various third party sources, including as described in paragraph 14, to provide better service to Website visitors and users, customise a Website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve a Website for your use. We may combine your visitor session information or other information collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable information from time to time in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest to you. By accessing a Website, you consent to information about you being collected, compiled and used in this way.
  16. “Cookies” are pieces of information that a Website transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. **Buchanan** may use cookies to make use of a Website and services as convenient as possible. Cookies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. Cookies allow **Buchanan** to monitor the items you may want to access as you move through a Website, and record how many people are using the different parts of a Website.
  17. "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (a Website "remembers" previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on a Website. They are erased once you exit your web browser or otherwise turn off your computer. 
  18. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as passwords), helping to determine what areas of a Website visitors find most valuable, and customising a Website based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by a Website on your computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only if you have registered or have otherwise consented to the retention of personally identifiable information you have provided to the Website. Otherwise, a Website's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the Website. 
  19. You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser. 
  20. A Website may use IP addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a Website, and administer and improve the Website.
  21. "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell a Website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to a Website and on different pages of a Website. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.
  22. "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of a Website and the user experience, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
  23. We may also use these technologies in HTML emails that we send to our visitors for a number of purposes including: to determine whether our visitors have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails; to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a visitor has closed an email; and to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular email. 



**Purposes for which Buchanan collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information**

  24. Personal information collected will be used for the following primary purposes: 
    1. For the purposes for which it was collected (as advised in this Privacy Policy).

    3. To maintain the functionality of a Website, including the provision of information to you relating to the content available on the Website and e-commerce transactions conducted via the Website.

    7. To maintain our relationship with you.
    8. To provide you with targeted product trials.

Failure to provide personal information may result in Buchanan being unable to provide you with certain content, information, upcoming promotion, event or product information and/or accept promotion entries (where applicable).
  26. In order to operate a Website or deliver a service (including for example, processing of product trial registration), personal information may also be shared with Buchanan group companies, selected service providers and/or other trusted third parties either in Australia or overseas countries which may include but are not limited to Indonesia, Canada and the United States of America. Buchanan group companies, selected service providers and/or other trusted third parties may be engaged by Buchanan to perform a variety of functions, such as data storage, fulfilling orders, conducting market research, , assisting with promotions and providing technical services for our Websites. These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions.
  27. **Buchanan** recognises the trust with which you provide personal information, and except as stated in this Privacy Policy, such information will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes without consent. However, Buchanan reserves the right to use or disclose any information, including personal information, as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the rights or property of Buchanan, any member of the Buchanan group, or any member of the public, to protect the integrity of a Website, to fulfil your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.
