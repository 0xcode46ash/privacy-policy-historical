When you are on a secure web page, the lock icon at the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked when you are just 'surfing' in an unsecured mode.

If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, We will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00.

You can view products stored in your Wish List, delete them, move them to your shopping cart, or email some or all of the products to a friend.

If you have an account, you will be taken to the Wish List options page. You will be able to: 

**Create a Wish List** :
