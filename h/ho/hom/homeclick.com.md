This ensures your information is encrypted and cannot be read by any other Internet users. The secure mode begins upon ordering. To check to make sure that information is encrypted, a tiny padlock icon will appear at the bottom of your browser, letting you know information is being sent over a secured connection 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
