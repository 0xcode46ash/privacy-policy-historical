# FAQ: Privacy & Security

**Our Security Policy**

We go to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected â€” so you can buy online with confidence. 

**Your financial information is safe**  
We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard, in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. In addition, we employ an outside company to "audit" our security and make sure it is trustworthy. 

**Your transactions are secure**  
When you've finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or a closed lock will appear on the lower status bar of your browser to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. (If you do not see the lock in Internet Explorer, click View/Status Bar.) 

To ensure our customer security and site performance, our web servers are hosted off-site. 

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call 1-800-860-6272. Our fax number for orders is 1-888-860-2344. Or, send your order to :
