Protecting your privacy is important to Home ScienceTools. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Why we collect personal information**  
Home Science Tools collects and uses your personal information to serve you before and after your purchase. We use your contact information and preferences to keep you up to date on product announcements, offers, science teaching tips, company news, and other information we think you'd like to learn about. When you request information about a product, a customer service representative will contact you to follow-up on your inquiry. We may also use your personal information to contact you about participating in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

**How we collect personal information**  
We might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register on our web site, request a product catalog, ask a question of our Frequently Asked Question database, or participate in an online survey. When you ask to be included in an email mailing list, such as subscribing to our company newsletter, we also collect your personal information. 

To save you time and make our web services easier to use, we may make your personal information accessible to multiple web sites operated by Home Training Tools. That means that if you register with one web site, you can sign-in to all web sites operated by Home Training Tools. Changes made to your contact information or personal preferences from any of our sites will result in a change being made to our centralized, secure, customer database. 

**When we disclose personal information**  
Your personal information may be shared within the Home Training Tools organization, including with our customer service representatives. These customer service representatives will protect your personal information in accordance with this Home Training Tools Customer Privacy Policy. 

With your permission, we may refer you to other independent organizations that can provide you a complementary or superior product or service. 

Home Science Tools works with other companies that help us provide you with products and services. We may provide your contact information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only. 

**Home Science Tools will not share your contact information nor personal preferences with organizations outside of our company for the purpose of soliciting you for promotional reasons.**

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. 

**How we protect your personal information**  
Home Science Tools safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and internal management procedures. 

**Access to your personal information**  
You have access to the contact information we have about you.

If you would like to review other personal information that Home Science Tools may have about you, email us at [service@hometrainingtools.com](mailto:service@hometrainingtools.com). 

**Collecting other information**  
When you browse the Home Science Tools website, you are able to do so anonymously. However, your browser does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using. 

Home Science Tools's website uses cookies. Specifically, the website will set a temporary "session cookie" that lasts the length of your visit to the site, and allows us to collect information on what you view on the site. However, this information is not in any way identified with you personally, unless you choose to browse the site while signed in. We study usage patterns so we can improve our site's convenience and ease of use. 

Emails we send you may contain hypertext links back to our web site. We track click-throughs to these links to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. 

**Our companywide commitment to privacy**  
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Home Science Tools employee. 

Home Science Tools does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. 

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner. 

The Home Science Tools Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. 

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or any business practices of Home Science Tools, please contact us at 1-800-860-6272 or e-mail us at [service@hometrainingtools.com](mailto:service@hometrainingtools.com).
