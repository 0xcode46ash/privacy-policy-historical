Homescape.com respects the privacy of its users. In this document we explain how we use information you supply us via the Homescape.com web site. This privacy policy may be modified in the future. If it is, a new policy will be posted on our web sites.

Homescape.com is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of any web sites to which it may link.

**What personal information do we collect?**

**Registration:** When you sign up to use one of our services, request a price quote or enter a contest, we may specifically ask for information about you, including name, age, address, phone number, and demographic information. Registrants must be 18 years of age and agree to the terms and conditions of the web site.

**Premium Services:** Some parts of our web site may use an order form for you to request optional services. We collect a visitor's credit card information to bill the user for these optional services. All other areas of our web site are free.

**Cookies:** Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by our computers (or servers) to identify your computer. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them there and are unable to execute any code or virus. We use cookies to recognize you when you visit our site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you have entered your ZIP code on one of our forms, it is stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again. Cookies can also tell us which advertising you have seen on our site, allowing us to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information. Cookies may also compile data (which is not identifiable to any specific individual) about our visitors and may be shared with other companies such as an outside advertising company.

**IP Addresses:** Homescape.com also compiles IP addresses, the location of your computer on the Internet, for administrative purposes

**How do we use the information we collect?**

Homescape.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site, for development purposes, and to inform advertisers and partners about consumers clicking on their advertising or other messages. In these analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.

**E-mail:** Using the e-mail addresses provided by registrants, Homescape.com, its advertisers, affiliates, partners, or third parties may periodically send promotional e-mail. In any case where we might use an email address for this purpose, you will be able to indicate at registration that you do not wish to receive such promotional e-mails from Homescape.com, its advertisers, affiliates, partners or third parties. However, by registering, you agree that Homescape.com may contact you by e-mail regarding account status, changes to the registrant agreement, and to confirm registration. In addition, if you provide your email address or other contact data in connection with a request for product information, Homescape.com, an advertiser, affiliate, partner or third parties, as applicable, will use that information to contact you.

**Data Security:** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate procedures to protect the information we collect online, including reasonable and appropriate security for credit card submissions.

**What is Homescape.com's relationship with affiliates and business partners?**

We have close relationships with affiliated newspapers and other business partners. Certain of those affiliates and partners have web pages that are branded both with our trademarks and the trademarks of our business partners. You may visit us through a co-branded page that is, for example, a Homescape.com page that is co-branded with XYZ Newspaper's web site.

**With whom do we share the information we collect?**

In the future, Homescape.com may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, but only if you have authorized Homescape.com to do so. At the present time, Homescape.com will only share personally identifiable information with third parties as is necessary for those third parties to provide information or perform services specifically requested by you. Additionally, if you entered the Homescape.com web site through a site maintained by one of our affiliates or business partners, then your personally identifiable information may be shared with that affiliate or business partner, provided that use of the information does not violate this privacy policy.

**Message Boards:** Homescape.com may offer message boards, or forums, on some of its web sites. Any information you disclose when posting a message in these forums becomes public. Moreover, registrants who post a message in our forums make their e-mail addresses available to others through a feature of our software, which could result in unsolicited e-mail from third parties.

**Children's Guidelines:** We believe that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online. Note: we define "children" as minors younger than 13. We do not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children. We do not knowingly allow children to register with us, or to participate in any of our promotions or contests. We encourage parents to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. You should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address, or other information on any web site, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages.

**Does this privacy statement extend to links to other sites?**

This site contains links to other sites. While we encourage our business partners to adopt privacy policies that build users' trust and confidence in the Internet, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of web sites linked to any of our sites. We may allow third parties to sponsor promotions and sweepstakes through our site. Use of any personal information provided to such a third party will be governed by that party's privacy policy.

**Collection of certain information by Homescape.com and third parties**

Homescape.com, newspaper affiliates, business partners and other third parties may collect information about you when using the site through the use of cookies and web beacons. For example, Homescape.com uses third-party companies to serve advertisements when you visit the site and to collect statistical information regarding site usage. Third-party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, Homescape.com may share statistical and behavioral data about visitors to this site with these third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on this site and on other websites. These third-party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit on the site through the use of web beacons. In the course of serving advertisements to you, these third-party advertising companies may also place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer to allow them to recognize web beacons and otherwise improve advertising effectiveness.
