We do not access information about your identity while you browse our website. You remain anonymous to us. While you view our site, our system tracks the pages you visit, the pages you download, the site you came from, and notes your IP address (but not your identity). We may also place a "cookie" on your computer that tracks your use of our website. A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your hard drive. It takes up very little room on your system and helps us estimate the number of persons that use our site and determine the areas of our site that are the most popular. The cookie does not provide us with specific, personally-identifying information about you, such as your name, address, tax identification number, social security number, email address, or phone number. You can remain anonymous while you are browsing our website, but once you complete an application for a loan, we will use the information stated therein to determine if you are eligible for the loan you requested. We may retain all of the information you provide to us in that application process, including personally-identifying information such as your name, income, assets, liabilities, age, social security number, and employment.
