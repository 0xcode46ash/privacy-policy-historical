  1. **What is Homestead?**   
Homestead is a Web publishing service that allows anyone to build sophisticated Web pages quickly and easily. Your Web site and any files associated with it are stored at www.homestead.com, allowing you to have universal access through any Web browser and any compatible computer. Only you (and anyone you invite to join your Homestead) will have access to your files. Your unique Homestead member name and password gives only you access to your files.
  2. **What information does Homestead gather and track?**   

    * When you sign up for a Homestead account, we ask that you give us your name, e-mail address, and month and year of birth. We also ask that you tell us how you heard about Homestead and whether you have built a Web page before. You have the option of providing us with additional demographic information (such as your interests and computer experience). 
    * When you connect to our Web site, we will detect your IP address and store a cookie on your computer. An explanation of cookies can be found in #11. 
    * When you fill out a form on our site requesting technical support, information, or free services, we ask you for your contact information and other information relevant to that particular service. 
    * When you fill out a form on our site requesting a paid service, we ask you for relevant financial information (such as a credit card number or bank account number). 
    * We occasionally ask users to fill out optional online surveys. These optional surveys ask for demographic information and other information about computer use. 
  3. **How does Homestead use my information?**   

    * Your contact information from the sign-up form is used to send you information about our company and products. We also use this information to contact you when necessary. You may choose not to receive messages from us by following the opt-out instructions listed in #8. Any optional demographic information you provide us is used only in broad aggregate form. We do not sell any user information to any outside source. 
    * Your unique IP address is used only when we need to diagnose technical problems with our site. We use cookies to correctly deliver account information to you. To find out more about cookies, please see #11. 
    * Any information you provide to us through a form requesting technical support, information, or free services is used in for that specific situation only. The information you submit is not saved or used for any other purpose. 
    * Any information you provide to us through a form requesting a paid service is used to administer the service and to bill the user for products and services. Occasionally we partner with other companies that can help us better provide paid services to our customers. In these cases, we will explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. 
    * Any information you submit in an online survey is only used in broad aggregate form. 
  4. **How private is my account information?**   

    * Homestead ensures the confidentiality of all information you provide about yourself. We will not share your information with any third party without your express permission. 
    * You have exclusive access to your account information when you login to www.homestead.com. Our Technical Support staff has access to your account information, which we view only when technical support or maintenance requires it. 
    * When you invite other users to join your Homestead (or Homestead mailing list), or if you join a Homestead (or Homestead mailing list), your member name, first and last names, e-mail address, and date of last login become visible to the other members of that Homestead (or Homestead mailing list). 
    * We participate in several types of partnerships. We do not sell your information to our partners. 
    * Homestead makes chat rooms, guest books, and other means of online communication available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in a public forum such as a chat room or guest book. 
  5. **How secure is my account information?**   
Homestead has security measures in place that filter and block known offenders and methods of intrusion into our system. These measures protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
  6. **Does Homestead sell user account information?**   
No. Homestead does not sell or otherwise distribute your information to any third parties without your specific consent. We are a free service that sells selected advertising space, so we do reserve the right to distribute information about our user base in broad aggregate form. Your specific and personal account information, however, is kept completely confidential. 
  7. **Does Homestead condone spam?**   
No. We encourage our users to publicize their Web sites, but sending spam or unsolicited e-mail to publicize a Homestead Web site is strictly prohibited. It is prohibited to send unsolicited commercial e-mail that advertises or mentions a Homestead Web site over our (or any) network. It is also inappropriate to widely publicize your password if you have placed your content behind password protection. If we receive reports that a Homestead page has appeared in an unsolicited e-mail or other spam, or if a password to a protected page has been inappropriately publicized, we will remove the site from our servers. If the site's content is in violation of our Terms of Service, we will remove the site immediately. 
  8. **How do I opt out of receiving messages from Homestead?**   
If you do not want to receive messages from Homestead about service improvements, new features, and other product information and promotions, login to your Homestead account and visit the Personal Profile section under My Account. Check the box that says you would like to stop receiving messages from Homestead. If you would ever like to start receiving messages, you can always update your Personal Profile accordingly.
  9. **How do I update my account information?**   
You can control and update your contact information when you login by visiting the Personal Profile section under My Account. 
  10. **How do I delete or deactivate my account information from Homestead's database?**   
If you wish to remove your membership, please contact support@homestead.com with a request to do so. Your account will be permanently removed from our database and no record of it will remain.
  11. **How does Homestead use cookies?**   
When you visit www.homestead.com, we automatically store a cookie on your hard drive that identifies you to our site each time you visit. To ensure that someone else who uses your machine after you will not automatically be able to login as you, close your Web browser every time you are done using Homestead. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site saves on an individual's computer for site administration and record-keeping. Cookies enhance your computer's performance when surfing the Web by storing passwords, preferences, and other functional information. The use of cookies is an industry standard and most major Web sites, including Microsoft and Netscape, use them to improve their services.
