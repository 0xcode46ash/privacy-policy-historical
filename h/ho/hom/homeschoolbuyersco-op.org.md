**Group Purchases**  
If you have elected to receive special offers from Co-op suppliers, you may receive special time-limited offers to participate in group purchases. Other members will simultaneously receive the same time-limited offer so that, by purchasing as a group, the participatng members may receive volume discounts that are not avialable to members purchasing individually and separately.
