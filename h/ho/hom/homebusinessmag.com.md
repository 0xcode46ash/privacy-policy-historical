**_Privacy Statement_**

**Information Collection and Use**

Home Business Magazine and Home Business Magazine Online are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Home Business Magazine collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Order**

We request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Cookies **

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on our site, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. This anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Home Business Magazine Online or its analytic vendors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Home Business Magazine and Home Business Magazine Online are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Banner and Other Delivery**

Home Business Magazine Online may have certain companies help us deliver our banner ads and other online communications. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. The information they collect is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual. 

**Newsletters**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our ezine newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. We only send the newsletter to subscribers who opt-in to receive the newsletter after an invitation and/or sample issue. While we do utilize direct email to advise home-based business owners and telecommuters about offers and features of the website, we do so with full disclosure of the return website email and URL addresses. 

**Mailing Lists**

HBM Online provides lists of subscribers to list brokers for the purposes of direct mail, but honors all requests to have name and address removed from such lists upon request. 

Home Business Magazine (print edition) also provides lists of subscribers to list brokers for the purposes of direct mail, but honors all requests to have name and address removed from such lists upon request. 

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Home Business Magazine Online will automatically send the friends email inviting them to visit the site. The friend may contact Home Business Magazine Online at [admin@homebusinessmag.com](mailto:admin@homebusinessmag.com) to request the removal of this information from the database. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 

All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to _[admin@homebusinessmag.com](mailto:admin@homebusinessmag.com)_

**Special Offers**

We send new and established users of Home Business Magazine and Home Business Magazine Online occasional information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address or zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 

**Opt-out**

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at _[admin@homebusinessmag.com](mailto:admin@homebusinessmag.com)_

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
