Agents or contractors of Horizons Unlimited Group who have access to your personal information and prospect information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Horizons Unlimited Group. Horizons Unlimited Group may enhance or merge your information collected at its site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. 

**You can opt-out of receiving further marketing from Horizons Unlimited Group at any time**  
We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only Horizons Unlimited Group (or agents working on behalf of Horizons Unlimited Group and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from Horizons Unlimited Group by changing that option on your personal profile, or by emailing webmaster@huginc.com.

**Internet Commerce**  
The online stores on Horizons Unlimited Group sites are designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. Horizons Unlimited Group is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our sites. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may place an order without credit card information and a representative will contact you. Alternatively, you may always contact a sales representative over the telephone. Simply call 1-888-985-8585. It has always been a Horizons Unlimited Group practice to contact customers in the event of a potential problem with your purchase or any normal business communication regarding your purchase. 

**Customized Experience**  
New technologies are emerging on the Internet that help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At Horizons Unlimited Group, we primarily use "cookies" to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to your machine and to maintain your shopping experience in our online stores. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using, but beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience. Horizons Unlimited Group has no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Third party Internet sites and services accessible through Horizons Unlimited Group.com have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Horizons Unlimited Group has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your personal information, Horizons Unlimited Group cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
