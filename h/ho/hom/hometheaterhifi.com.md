Privacy Policy  |  [ ](http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=emailform&id=182&itemid=97 "E-mail")  
  
SDI uses reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of its Website visitors, users and registrants (for purposes of the Privacy Policy, "users") and their respective information pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy which applies solely to information collected by this Website. If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, please contact us.

**1\. Information Collection**  
SDI collects information from our users who voluntarily elect to provide such information. SDI is the sole owner of the information collected on our Website and we do not sell, share or rent this information to others except as disclosed herein. SDI may store information itself or arrange for storage in databases maintained by SDI's affiliates, agents or service providers. SDI retains its rights to these databases and the information contained therein.

Users in the European Union and other countries fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of their personal information in the United States of America.

**2\. Tracking Information**  
SDI may track certain user information solely to administer our Website, track users' respective logins and movements, including the domains from which people visit the Website, and analyze this data for trends and statistics on an aggregated basis only. This aggregated information is not linked in any way to user-identifiable information.   
We may share aggregated information solely with our service providers which have agreed to be bound by this Privacy Policy. SDI will also disclose data to the extent required by law and reserves the right to transfer users' data to a third party in the course of a sale or reorganization of SDI'S business or assets.

If, at any point, we decide to use any of our users' personally-identifiable information in a manner other than that stated at the time of collection, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide each user with the opportunity to opt out of SDI's modified use of his/her information at that time.

Children under the age of eighteen should not provide any personal information on this Website. Under applicable law, which provides additional privacy protections for children who use the Internet, we will not retain any information provided by a user whom we know to be under 18.

If a user's personally-identifiable information changes or if a user desires to terminate his/her registration, he/she can correct, update or remove all data provided to us via the registration information page or by e-mailing the editor. 

**3\. Surveys**  
From time to time, our Website may request contact and/or demographic information (i.e., zip code, gender, birth date or age) from its users through surveys. Participation in any such survey is completely voluntary and the user is under no obligation to participate or to disclose any information. This information will be used to monitor and/or improve the use and functionality of our Website.  
**  
4\. Security**  
Subject to the following paragraphs, SDI takes all reasonably diligent precautions to protect each user's information, both online and off-line. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free and, as set forth in the Terms of Use, SDI makes no warranty and assumes no liability for any such transmission or any damages incurred in connection therewith. If you have any questions about our Website security, please contact the editor.

SDI cannot and does not guarantee or warrant the security and privacy of information provided by users on or through the Website. Each user discloses personal information on or through our Website wholly at his/her own risk and each acknowledges that he/she is aware of the security and privacy risks involved, including but expressly not limited to limitations of the security, privacy and authentication measures in the Website, threats of external interference such as eavesdropping, breaking passwords and hacking, and contamination by viruses. 

In accordance with Section 2 of the Terms of Use, each user, on behalf of himself/herself and his/her heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, assigns and other successors in interest, hereby releases and discharges SDI from any and all liability or responsibility for any Damages suffered by that user arising out of or in connection with any disclosure of his/her personally-identifiable information other than as a result of SDI'S willful misconduct.
