**Wall2Wall Media Personal Information Privacy Policy**

Accountability

Wall2Wall Media and its subsidiaries (collectively “Wall2Wall Media”, “we”, “us”) has a firm commitment to protecting the personal information of the individuals we deal with. Information, which can identify an individual (“personal information”), is often required to provide contact information for advertisers in our electronic and print photo classified publications, for business transactions and for customer relationship management purposes. This Policy applies to the personal information we collect about our customers, advertisers and suppliers in Canada and describes how we use and share this information. It also describes how we maintain and secure personal information and how the individual concerned may request access to it. This Policy does not apply to Wall2Wall Media employee personal information or to information that does not qualify as “personal information” under applicable legislation in Canada.

**Information Collection**

Wall2Wall Media collects personal information that may include:

·          contact information, which typically includes such information as an individual’s name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and fax number. In some circumstances, some of this information may be business information which is not covered by this Policy;

·          business information, which typically includes business contact information (such as name, telephone number, address). To the extent that this information is personal information under applicable legislation, it is governed by this Policy;

·          financial information, which includes information such as account payment history and status and credit information; and

·          other information provided by our individual customers or suppliers, including such information as an individual provides to participate in a contest offered by us, in response to a survey we may conduct, in subscribing to receive information from a Web site operated by us or in contacting us to obtain information on our services.

We collect personal information primarily from the individual concerned; however, we also collect contact information from our affiliates and from third parties, such credit bureaux and reporting agencies (who provide us with business and credit-related information). ****

**Use and Disclosure of Information**

Wall2Wall Media will generally collect and use personal information for the following purposes: 

·        To evaluate and fulfil a request for our products, programs and services; 

·        For publication purposes or for posting on the Websites operated by Wall2Wall Media, such as employmentnews.com and hometrader.ca (the “Wall2Wall Media Websites”);

·        For sales and lead potential and for marketing purposes, for customer relationship management purposes;

·        To administer participation in contests;

·        To evaluate responses to surveys;

·        To respond to inquiries for information about Wall2Wall Media and its services;

·        To ascertain and verify creditworthiness and share credit information with credit rating agencies;

·        To administer, service and collect on accounts;

·        In certain circumstances, to grant access to its customers to information on their own accounts;

·        To process requests for the removal or correction of information from our files;

·        To meet legal, regulatory, security and processing requirements; and 

·        To contact customers with marketing or promotional materials regarding Wall2Wall Media products, programs and services or to assist its front-line staff in providing tailored sales offers to customers.

Wall2Wall Media may exchange or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes. **** If an individual does not want us to use his/her contact information for marketing purposes, this person should exercise his/her option to opt out of this use by indicating his/her wishes by contacting [privacy@wall2wallmedia.com](mailto:privacy@wall2wallmedia.com).

Personal information may be shared from the Wall2Wall Media Websites  to third parties in the form of sales leads – which is a core service provided by Wall2Wall Media through its websites. The info is entered into the online form and then emailed to the auto dealer or real estate agent. Furthermore, Wall2Wall Media discloses information to Mosaic Sales Solutions Canada Operating Company for the purposes of ROI analysis and for consumer and advertiser research and strategy development.  Our written agreements with such agents and contractors ensure that personal information can only be used for the purposes for which it was shared with the agents and contractors, and that the agents and contractors handle the personal information in accordance with this Policy. 

In a context where all or part of Wall2Wall Media’s assets or business are or may be sold, financed, insured, securitized, assigned or otherwise disposed of, we may also disclose personal information to the companies involved in such a transaction, for the purposes of allowing those companies to decide whether to proceed with the transaction and, where applicable, to provide the products, programs and services that Wall2Wall Media would otherwise provide and generally to carry on the Wall2Wall Media business. 

As part of our commitment to enhance our business services, Wall2Wall Media may identify other uses and disclosures for personal information in the future. In that event, we will seek the consent of the individuals concerned where required.

**Collection of Information Online**

Some Wall2Wall Media Websites registration forms require users to provide Wall2Wall Media contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that is used by Wall2Wall Media to provide services. Wall2Wall Media uses the customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Wall2Wall Media Websites or regarding services offered by Wall2Wall Media. 

Some Wall2Wall Media Websites use an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Wall2Wall Media Websites is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. Wall2Wall Media has no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. Wall2Wall Media collects customers’ financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retains this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law. 

Demographic and profile data is also collected on the Wall2Wall Media Websites. Wall2Wall Media uses this data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Wall2Wall Media Websites, showing the user content that Wall2Wall Media thinks he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the user’s preferences. 

Wall2Wall Media’s online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level). Wall2Wall Media uses contact data from its surveys to send users information about our products and services. The Wall2Wall Media Websites provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Wall2Wall Media at the point where contact information is requested.  Individuals also have the ongoing option of removing their contact information from our database so that they will not receive future communications or no longer receive service offered through the Wall2Wall Media Websites. 

If an individual decides not to provide us with personal information online, no material consequences will result, although this individual may be unable to participate in certain promotions, receive product information, or use portions of the Wall2Wall Media Websites that require personalized information or applications.
