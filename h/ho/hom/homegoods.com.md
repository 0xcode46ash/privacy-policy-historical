# Privacy & Security

Welcome to homegoods.com (the "Web site"), the Web site for HomeGoods, a division of The TJX Companies, Inc. ("TJX"). HomeGoods, TJX and its affiliates are the "TJX Businesses."

This Privacy and Security Policy is a part of the Web site which is also governed by the Web site's Terms of Use. By using the Web site you signify your assent to the conditions stated in the Privacy and Security Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy and Security Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/custserv/custserv.jsp?contentId=8) , please do not use our Web site.

HomeGoods wants to make your experience online convenient and safe. We want you to know what information we collect, how we may use that information, how we protect that information, and how we share that information.

**What Information We Collect**

We collect information that you provide when using our Web site. For example, when you shop online we obtain from you the information related to your purchase transaction, including your name, billing address, email address, telephone number, credit or debit card number and the name and address of gift recipients. All of this information is personal information. Also, when you participate in our surveys, enter sweepstakes or contests, sign up for e mail, send us feedback or submissions, you are providing us your personal information. (When we run a contest or sweepstakes, the rules will specify any additional ways in which the entry information from you will be used and shared.) 

In addition, each time you visit our Web site, our servers will automatically collect certain information describing your visit, including your IP address and browser information. This automatically collected information provides us with data regarding the use of the Web site.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

When we do collect information from you, we may use it for a number of purposes, including to:

  * Complete your purchase transactions and keep you informed about the status of your orders or purchases;
  *  Identify your product and service preferences, so that we can notify you of new or additional products, services and promotions that might be of interest to you;
  * Improve merchandise selections and customer service;
  * Notify you about new services, features, promotions and special offers relating to the TJX Businesses we think you will find valuable;
  * Respond to your inquiries;
  * Administer your participation in promotions, contests and sweepstakes in which you have chosen to participate; and
  *  Understand and improve your use and experience on our Web site.



On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to deter fraud and credit risk, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce our Web site Terms of Use.

**Those With Whom We Share Your Information**

We may share your personal information among the TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including Marshalls, TJ Maxx, AJ Wright, Bob's Stores, Winners, HomeSense, and TK Maxx). They may use this information to offer products and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this statement. Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as a part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of the TJX Businesses or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control. 

We also share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Policy. For example, we may use third parties to host our Web site, operate certain of its features, send emails, print or send mailings, authorize and process your payments, analyze data and assist in fulfilling your orders. These third party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose.

**Policies for Children**

We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.

**Links to Other Sites**

When you use our Web site, you may discover that it contains links to other sites that are not owned or operated by the TJX Businesses. These links are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of the linked sites and the TJX Businesses are providing them only as a convenience. As such, the TJX Businesses do not warrant, represent or assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy, completeness or operation of any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site), or the practices or privacy and other policies contained in any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site). You should familiarize yourself, therefore, with the specific legal, privacy and security information contained in any such linked sites.

Our Web site also contains links to other sites operated by the TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from Web site to Web site.

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file which is stored on a computer's hard drive which allows us to recognize and track users on our Web site and assists us in providing our customers with a productive shopping experience. We and some of our third-party service providers use cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and can be reset by using the "Help" portion of the toolbar to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Should you choose to disable any cookies associated with the Web site, you will not be able to take full advantage of all the Web site's features, but you should be able to navigate the Web site without difficulty.

**Other Types of Data Collection**

We use a third party service provider to help us gather information about the areas that you visit on the Web site in order to evaluate and improve the customer experience and the convenience of the Web site. To find out more about our service provider's privacy policy, or if you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your browsing through the use of this service, please [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html).

**How We Protect Your Information**

We employ various security measures designed to help protect the personal information that we collect about you. We have instituted software firewalls to protect our servers and network. When your credit card information is collected through our Web site, it is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. We also use VeriSign technology to help us protect against fraud.  Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and therefore we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information.
