# HomeFinder.ca - Our Privacy and Security Policy

HomeFinder.ca respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our Web sites. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in the submission form where information is collected, any personal information you provide to HomeFinder.ca will be known only to two parties: you and HomeFinder.ca. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Home Listings Section  
**HomeFinder.ca does not monitor or control any of the email links found in the Home Listing sections of this site. This section is offered by HomeFinder.ca as a free service for realtors to advertise property for sale. The information in the Home Listings sections of this site are entered by the sales agent who is listing the property. HomeFinder.ca does not review these for accuracy or authenticity.

**Traffic Data  
**Each time a visitor comes to a HomeFinder.ca Web site, our server, like most on the Web, collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from WebTV.net or home.com) referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a HomeFinder.ca Web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., Internet Explorer browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the HomeFinder.ca sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Use of HomeFinder.ca Cookies  
**A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to help record traffic data through our banners, to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. This is the only place HomeFinder.ca uses cookies. Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. **

Realtor Membership

** HomeFinder.ca collects personal information from Realtors who sign up to submit listings, including first and last names, e-mail address, street address and phone numbers. We do not share this information with other companies and will not do so (except in aggregate form, which does not reveal members' identities) without first obtaining a member's consent.

**Promotion  
**From time to time, HomeFinder.ca may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and province of residence) to be used for the event. HomeFinder.ca may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to third-party or non-participating organizations without the user's consent, and HomeFinder.ca will request that co-sponsors of such events uphold the privacy of the registrants' information.

**Surveys  
**HomeFinder.ca will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Other disclosure of personal information  
**HomeFinder.ca will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you send via an email link to a realtor in the Home Listing sections of this site.

**Hyperlinks are Not Endorsements  
**HomeFinder.ca makes no representations about any other web site which you may access through this one. A link to a non-HomeFinder.ca web site does not mean that HomeFinder.ca endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such web site. It is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for use is free of such items as viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?  
**If you have any further questions or concerns about HomeFinder.ca's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to
