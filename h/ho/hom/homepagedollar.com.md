# Privacy Policy - Home Page Dollar

COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At HomePageDollar.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

**INFORMATION WE GATHER AND TRACK**

We gather two types of information about users:   
Information that users provide through voluntary submissions ie name, address, email address, telephone number, etc. Information we gather through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because we derive our revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances do we divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

WE TRACK INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:

**User supplied**

Information provided voluntarily by our users, ie their personal details, email addresses, preferences, etc

**Usage tracking**

HomePageDollar.com tracks individual user stats throughout our site. This is to ensure that we continually improve our service to you in getting the best advertising exposure your site needs. We sometimes track and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. 

**Cookies**

As is standard safe practice with most websites on the internet (like banks, etc), we may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Our cookies are primarily used to identify you when you login, bring up your account page, ad stats and pass you from page to page without logging you out unnecessarily. You must have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enjoy the free advertising benefits our site has to offer you. 

SHARING OF THE INFORMATION

Your email address and other personal details will never be hired, sold, lent or given to any third party. We will use your email address to communicate with you and to send you updates, enhancements, news and promotions relating to our service. We may be obliged to pass any user's details to any law enforcement agency or court of law if the user is being investigated for or suspected of any crime. 

CHILDREN 

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.
