# Privacy Policy

We use your personal information to fulfill your requests and tailor offerings for you. If you tell us that you prefer a certain style of home design products, we may emphasize that style in our presentation to you.

When you become a member of HomePortfolio, we also use your personal information to contact you with home design tips or special members-only offers. Occasionally, we may let you know about other companies whose products or services might be of interest. We may also share your personal information if you link to one of our partner sites, so that our partner site can serve you seamlessly.

HomePortfolio will also require a screen name and password if you choose to participate in Talk About, HomePortfolio's online community discussion boards. The screen name you select will be used to identify your online presence in Talk About.

Please be aware that the discussion boards are public venues. If you choose to include personal information in a message or in your author profile, that information will be available to any person viewing or participating in that discussion board. Posting information on public boards may result in unsolicited messages to you and/or the use of such information in a way that is not intended by you. HomePortfolio's ability to delete or modify information which you provide may be limited by technology or its internal procedures/policies and as such HomePortfolio may not be able to mitigate the consequences of your posting such information in a public forum.

In addition, HomePortfolio may occasionally use portions of a discussion in reference to Talk About for publications and promotions. See
