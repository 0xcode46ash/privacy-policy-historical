# About HomePortfolio: Privacy

Privacy refers to the ways HomePortfolio collects and uses personal information, as well as to the safeguards we put in place to make sure our practices are fair and adequate. 

**What do you do with my personal information?** We use your personal information to fulfill your requests and tailor offerings for you. If you tell us that you prefer a certain style of home design products, we may emphasize that style in our presentation to you.

When you become a member of HomePortfolio, we also use your personal information to contact you with home design tips or special members-only offers. Occasionally, we may let you know about other companies whose products or services might be of interest. We may also share your personal information if you link to one of our partner sites, so that our partner site can serve you seamlessly. 

HomePortfolio will also require a screen name and password if you choose to participate in Talk About, HomePortfolio's online community discussion boards. The screen name you select will be used to identify your online presence in Talk About. 

Please be aware that the discussion boards are public venues. If you choose to include personal information in a message or in your author profile, that information will be available to any person viewing or participating in that discussion board. Posting information on public boards may result in unsolicited messages to you and/or the use of such information in a way that is not intended by you. HomePortfolio's ability to delete or modify information which you provide may be limited by technology or its internal procedures/policies and as such HomePortfolio may not be able to mitigate the consequences of your posting such information in a public forum. 

In addition, HomePortfolio may occasionally use portions of a discussion in reference to Talk About for publications and promotions. See 

Your HomePortfolio registration will pre-register you with our Portfolio Partner sites. Learn about your Home Design Portfolio and how to use it at other sites. Portfolio Partners are clients whose Web sites are powered by HomePortfolio.

The Personal HomeStyle newsletter is jointly administered by HomePortfolio and Better Homes and Gardens.com (BHG.com). If you choose to subscribe to this newsletter, the registration information you provide is subject to joint use by both HomePortfolio and BHG.com. 

In any case where your personal information is shared outside of HomePortfolio, our goal is to have business partners adhere to the same rigorous privacy practices that we do.

As HomePortfolio develops its business, it might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information may be one of the transferred business assets. In the event that HomePortfolio Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired or merged with another entity, user information is likely to be one of the transferred assets. 

**Do you use cookies?** HomePortfolio does use cookies to identify our registered users. This allows us to recognize you when you enter our site, without asking you to log in every time. A cookie is simply a text file on your hard drive, containing a unique string of characters. The HomePortfolio server recognizes your unique string of characters when you visit our site, and is then able to associate your computer with your personal data file on our host computer. That's why we can greet you by name when you visit us again, for example. 

If you choose not to use cookies, you can set your browser to refuse them. In that case, we will have to ask you to log in every time you make use of personalized features such as your Portfolio or Retailer Locator. 

Sometimes we contract with an outside agency to serve banner ads for HomePortfolio. People who click through the ads to visit HomePortfolio may receive cookies. In this case, the cookies are used only to gather aggregate data on advertising effectiveness. 

  


**How do you keep my personal information secure?** HomePortfolio takes many steps to make sure your information is safe on our site. Our mission is to make your experience as hassle-free and secure as possible. 

HomePortfolio guarantees the security of your data. If your personal information stored on HomePortfolio is ever used to make an unauthorized purchase, we will refund the portion not covered by your credit card agreement. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, HomePortfolio will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at HomePortfolio while using the secure server. In the unlikely event this happens, you must also notify your credit card provider. 

Rest assured, in the entire history of our site, we have never experienced an unauthorized purchase. Please refer to the Security section for more details on how we keep your information safe once we have collected it.
