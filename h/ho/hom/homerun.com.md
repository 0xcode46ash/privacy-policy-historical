### Required Disclosures

We may also share you information (i) if we are required to do so or believe to be required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent or defend against misuse of Rearden Commerce services, violation of our intellectual property rights, breach of any of your or our business customers' obligations to Rearden Commerce, physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.

## Your Choices

We offer you certain choices about what information we collect from you, how we use and disclose the information, and how we communicate with you. Here are the choices we offer.

### Use of Rearden Commerce Products and Services

Many of the Rearden Commerce products and services are designed to facilitate and enhance consumers' ability to interact with and obtain products and services from third parties. This business model requires Rearden Commerce to share information about you with various merchants (such as airlines, hotels, restaurants, car services and reservation aggregators) and other third parties. For example, we may share your information and your purchasing preferences with merchants who request information on individuals who purchased the merchant’s products or services. A merchant may use this information to fulfill its obligations in connection with the transaction and to communicate with you should it choose to do so. Please note that these merchants and other third parties are not our service providers or agents; they may process the personal information we provide to them in accordance with their own privacy practices and privacy notices. You may choose not to provide your personal information to Rearden Commerce or such third parties by refraining from using our products or services. To deactivate your account, you may email us at privacy@reardencommerce.com.

## Access and Correction

You may obtain a copy of certain personal information we maintain about you or update or correct inaccuracies in that information by logging into the online account you may establish on our websites.

Subject to applicable law, you may have certain additional rights to request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal data, and have the information blocked or deleted, as appropriate.

## Public Sites

We may provide areas on our sites where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others, or can review products or services, and submit media content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a merchant review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users or businesses may do with the information you voluntarily post.

## Data Transfers

When we obtain personal information about you, we may process the information outside of the country in which you are located, including in the United States.

## How We Endeavor to Protect Personal Information

We use commercially reasonable efforts designed to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including the use of encryption, firewalls and Secure Socket Layers in certain circumstances. To help safeguard personal information against loss and unauthorized access, we employ many different security techniques, including, for example, regulating the physical and virtual access to our databases, servers, back-ups, encryption keys or other network and security-related infrastructure components. In addition, we encrypt certain information, such as password and credit card numbers, in storage.

Please note that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. We make no guarantee of confidentially or privacy of any communication or information transmitted to or from Rearden Commerce sites.

## Data Retention

In the ordinary course of business, we retain information about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement as long as you maintain an account. We also may retain in our system certain personal information associated with an account that you request to have deactivated for an additional period or to comply with technical, legal, data integrity, fraud prevention and financial reporting requirements. We may retain aggregated information about demographics and online activity of groups of visitors to our websites beyond this retention period.
