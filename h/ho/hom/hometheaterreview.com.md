We recommend that if you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public (e.g., a University or library, etc.), remember to close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

**Third Party Links  
**  
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, HomeTheaterReview.com may choose various third party Web sites to link to from our site.
