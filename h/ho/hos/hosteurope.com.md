Google+ stores the information that you have given a certain content a +1 as well as information about the site that was visited during this action. Your +1 can be shown as notifications together with your profile name and your photo in Google-services, for example search results or in your Google-profile or on other places on websites and online-ads. Google+ collects data of your +1-activity to improve Google-services for users and others. In order to use the Google +1 button, a worldwide, public Google-profile is required, which has to at least contain the name chosen for the profile. This name is used in all Google-services. In some cases this name can substitute another name you have used when sharing information over your Google-account.
