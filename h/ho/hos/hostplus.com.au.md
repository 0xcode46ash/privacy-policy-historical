# HOSTPLUS - Our Privacy Policy

## At HOST **PLUS**  we understand that protecting your privacy is important.

The Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) as amended regulations, through a set of principles known as the National Privacy Principles, describe the how we use, disclose and store information collected from you1.

This webpage explains our policies and practices with respect to our management of your personal information.

### What information do we collect?

We ask you (or in the case of employer sponsored members, your employer) to provide personal information such as your name and address, date of birth, Tax File Number (TFN), contact details, occupation and employer.

There are also specific circumstances where we will ask for additional information such as:

  * personal health and income information (if you are applying for additional insurance protection or salary continuance), or
  

  * your bank account details (if you are requesting a direct debit to your superannuation account, or payment of pension into your nominated account), or
  

  * your dependants (for the purposes of paying benefits in the event of your death),
  

  * we and/or our insurer may also need to collect additional information from medical practitioners or from your employer for the purposes of assessing your eligibility for the insurance cover you have applied for or the assessment of a claim.
  



We will always seek your express consent before collecting this kind of sensitive information. We are also required to ask for certain information as by law. Wherever there is a legal requirement for us to ask for information about you, we will inform you of the obligation and the consequences of not giving us the requested information.

For example, we are required to ask for your [TFN](https://web.archive.org/super/get-your-super-sorted/provide-your-tfn) when you become a member of HOST **PLUS**. If you choose not to give us your TFN you may be subjected to additional tax on your contributions, not being able to make [personal contribution](https://web.archive.org/super/add-extra-to-your-super) and will not qualify for the [government co-contributions](https://web.archive.org/super/add-extra-to-your-super/co-contributions) if eligible.

Where you provide your TFN to us upon our request, please note that from 1 July 2012, we are able to utilise your TFN as a primary identifier. Your TFN will be used to identify any multiple accounts you may have within the superannuation fund and consolidating these into just one account. It may also be utilised to assist in locating “lost” superannuation money that may have been collected by the ATO see note below.

### How do we use the information that we collect from you?

We collect personal information from you so that we are able to:

  * establish and manage your superannuation account,
  

  * implement your investment choices,
  

  * establish and maintain your additional insurance protection,
  

  * process contributions, transfer monies or pay benefits,
  

  * report the investment performance of your account to you,
  

  * keep you up to date on other products and services available to you as a HOST **PLUS**  member, and


  * in the case of your TFN, access the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) SuperMatch system to inform you about your superannuation interests, assist you to manage your superannuation interests as reported to the ATO and reunite you with lost super or monies held on your behalf by the ATO.



Your personal information will not be used or disclosed for any other purpose, without your consent, except where permitted or required by law.

### What if you don't give us the information we request?

You are not required to give us the information that we request. However, if you do not give us the information that we ask for, or the information you give is not complete or accurate, this may:

  * prevent or delay the processing of your application or any claim,
  

  * affect your eligibility for specified insurance cover, or
  

  * prevent us from contacting you.



### Your access to the information we collect

You may request access to the personal information we hold about you. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover any costs incurred.

There may be circumstances where we are unable to give you access to the information that you have requested. If this is the case we will let you know and explain the reasons. You have a right to ask us to correct any information we hold about you if you believe it is not accurate, complete or up to date. If we do not agree with the corrections you have supplied, we are not required to alter the information.

If you have a concern about this, or anything else about the privacy of your information, you may lodge a complaint with us: In writing to -  **Privacy Officer,**  HOST **PLUS** **, Locked Bag3, Carlton South Vic 3053**. If our Privacy Officer is unable to resolve your complaint, you may lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner by contacting the Hotline on  **1300 363 992** , or visit their website on [www.oaic.gov.au/index.html](http://www.oaic.gov.au/index.html)
