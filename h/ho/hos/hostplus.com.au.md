# Privacy

### The Hostplus Privacy Policy – our commitment to you.

At Hostplus we’re run to benefit our members, which means we’re committed to acting in your best interests at all times.  We’re also committed to making life as easy as possible for you.  And because we’re a super fund, there is a certain amount of personal information we need to collect from you in order to provide you with the services and support you need. 

We often say that in the superannuation business we sell trust. The nature of our product means our members need to trust us to look after their money for many years, decades in fact.  And your personal information is no different.

This policy briefly explains the main ways we protect your privacy, the reasons why we collect your personal information, and how we comply with the Australian Privacy Principles. 

### What is personal information? 

Personal information means information we hold about you from which your identity can reasonably be determined. 

### So why does Hostplus collect your personal and information? 

In many cases, the law requires us to collect your personal information, for example, in order to identify you.  It also allows us to set up your super account, to keep it running smoothly and to respond to any queries or requests you may have regarding your account.  These might include: 

  * implementing your investment choices, 
  * establishing and maintaining your insurance arrangements, 
  * processing super contributions, 
  * transferring monies or paying benefits, 
  * reporting the investment performance of your account to you
  * the provison of financial product advice,
  * market research and product and service improvement, and
  * keeping you up to date on other products and services available to you as a Hostplus member (which may include sending you some marketing communications).



Certain information such as your Tax File Number (TFN) is required for taxation and superannuation purposes and is authorised to be collected under the _Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993_. Your TFN also allows us **** to look for other super accounts you may have lost track of or super money that has been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 

So that we can better tailor our information and products to your needs, we also use technology known as “cookies” to collect statistical information on website activity, such as the number of people using our website and how they navigate through it.

At times we may need to collect sensitive information from you such as medical information and family relationship details in order to process insurance applications and benefit claims.   This information is used by Hostplus and our relevant insurers to assess your eligibility for an insured benefit.  We will always seek your express consent before we collect any sensitive information from you, and we will ensure that the collection of this information is absolutely necessary.

### What personal information do we ask for? 

We collect information that’s relevant to our relationship with you, as your super fund.  This includes:

  * Name
  * Date of birth
  * Address
  * Tax File Number (TFN)
  * Insurance cover
  * Australian Business Number
  * Salary
  * Occupation
  * Phone number
  * Financial details

  * Medical information
  * Affiliations with industry groups
  * Family and/or personal relationship details



### How do we collect and hold your personal information? 

Where possible, we will collect information from you directly. Sometimes we collect personal information from a Third Party you would reasonably expect us to collect from, such as an alliance partner for market research and to improve our product and services.

Personal information may be collected through the following channels:
