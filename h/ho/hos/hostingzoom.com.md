When you provide personally identifiable information to Hosting Zoom through one of our Web sites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. However, Hosting Zoom reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Hosting Zoom services. 

Hosting Zoom currently only sends service communication e-mails through www.hostingzoom.com, and does not send marketing e-mails or newsletters through www.hostingzoom.com. The service communication e-mails are essential to our registering you for service and to our continuing provision of services to you. Therefore, you may not opt out of receiving these e-mail messages.

Hosting Zoom will not, however, sell, trade, or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to any person. On those Hosting Zoom sites where you may provide Hosting Zoom with credit card, electronic payment service, or other ordering information via the Web, Hosting Zoom protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary Web-based security and encryption protocols, an example of which is the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, Hosting Zoom will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and non-proprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, Hosting Zoom assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

**3\. Non-Personally Identifiable (Generic) Information.**

In general, Hosting Zoom gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the Hosting Zoom sites visited. Hosting Zoom gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and Web site needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including “cookies” (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about Hosting Zoom services). Hosting Zoom does not combine information collected in this way with any personally identifiable information. You can set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it. However, refusing some cookies may make it impossible to use or navigate the Hosting Zoom Web site properly. 

**4\. Your Hosting Zoom-Hosted Web Site, Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Third Party Sites.**

Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any bulletin board, chat room, or Web site that Hosting Zoom may host for you as part of your Hosting Zoom services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. Hosting Zoom cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally, Hosting Zoom Web sites may contain links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to Hosting Zoom. Hosting Zoom cannot protect any information you may disclose at these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit. 

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
