#### Privacy Policy

Questions? Contact us. 

Customer privacy is important to us. We take measures to ensure that customer information is kept secure. To help you protect your privacy, we provide a short notice on what information we collect and what information we use. 

#### Information We Collect

We collect certain information to help us contact you about your services. This information includes:

  * Full Name
  * Email address
  * Home/office address
  * Phone number
  * IP Address



We do not collect credit or debit card information, as payments are processed off-site by PayPal.

#### How We Use Information

We use the information that you have provided to complete your order(s). We do not share your information with outside parties unless it has been authorized by you.

We never share or sell personally identifiable information with other parties.

We always provide the option to opt-out of emails from HostMyBytes using the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom.

#### Data Security Measures

We secure data in three parts. We secure our servers physically, their connections, and the software storing their data. Servers are secured physically by mantraps, 24/7 security, and CCTV monitoring. We use encrypted connections to secure their connections through SSL. We secure the data by hardening our servers and performing periodic security checks.
