###  How Do We Use a Customer’s Information? 

If you have provided us with your contact information as a Hostway customer, we use that information to establish our services for you, such as creating and maintaining your customer account and your choice of services. We use payment information for payment processing purposes only. We may also create and maintain customer logs in the normal course of providing service. 

Our trusted affiliates are responsible for processing or handling some of the information we receive, such as order fulfillment for phone services. Those affiliates are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us including marketing and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.
