This Policy describes Hostway’s general principles for the collection and use of information from customers and visitors to our Website. We want to ensure that you understand how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us. For visitors, we've structured our Website so that, in general, you can visit us without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. For prospective and existing customers and partners, once you choose to provide us with personal information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with Hostway.

### What type of information does Hostway collect?

When you visit our Website, our Web server collects basic user information about you that includes your ISP's domain, the time you accessed our Website, and the pages from within our Website that you visit, and this basic information is not personal information except as needed to prevent fraud or abuse of the system.

When you sign up for Hostway's services, you provide us with both contact and payment information. Contact information typically includes your name, address, and phone number. Payment information typically includes your credit card number. While you are a Hostway customer, we manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and customer logs. In addition, we may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.

### How Do We Use a Customer’s Information?

If you have provided us with your contact information as a Hostway customer, we use that information to establish our services for you, such as creating and maintaining your customer account and your choice of services. We use payment information for payment processing purposes only. We may also create and maintain customer logs in the normal course of providing service.

Our trusted affiliates are responsible for processing or handling some of the information we receive, such as order fulfillment for phone services. Those affiliates are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us including marketing and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.

We will not disclose customer personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Hostway, our customers, or others. We may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable laws, respond to legal process, or where Hostway has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

Hostway also will not disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Hostway stores or transmits for its customers except where: (a) it is a matter or public safety or policy; (b) it is in connection with the transfer of other business assets; (c) it is required to cooperate with orders, warrants, or other legal process that Hostway determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and (d) it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Hostway and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime. If Hostway is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, and it results in a change of the ownership or use of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, then you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website. 

Hostway disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. Hostway will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm Hostway, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which Hostway may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of the TOU.

Hostway may use the information collected from you to direct service notices as well as provide you with other general information that may be of interest to you and information about our services or product offerings that you have opted to receive.

### Customer Interactions
