**Hostels.com Privacy Policy**

Hostels.com, and its advertisers and affiliates are absolutely committed to protecting the privacy of our readers. Below is information outlining our privacy policy and the responsible management of consumer information.

**Visiting Hostels.com**

Whenever you visit the Hostels.com web site, we do not proactively collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Hostels.com does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This information collected by Hostels.com is only aggregate statistical information used for the purpose of improving our readers experience and for targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.

If you would like additional information about the types of non-personally identifiable information that is collected by Hostels.com please click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603081359id_/http://www.hostels.com/privacy/privacy2.html).

**Hostels.com Mailing List**

If you choose, you may voluntarily provide us with your email address. If you do, Hostels.com will send you our monthly email newsletter. This newsletter will let you know about new articles and features on our web site that month. Once you subscribe to this newsletter you can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of the newsletter.

We will never share your email address with any third parties. Never. We won't share it, sell it, rent it, or leave it laying around where someone can see it. We hate SPAM as much as you do and we will always do our part to prevent your email address from getting into other peoples hands.

**Hostels.com Survey**

Occasionally, we may ask you to voluntarily participate in a survey. These surveys help us find out more about our readers and improve our web site. Again, no information collected in our surveys will personally identify you. It is only used for aggregate statistical purposes. We may share the information you provide in these voluntary surveys to our advertisers so that the advertising you see on Hostels.com is better suited for our readers.

**Cookies**

At this time, Hostels.com does not use "cookies". If Hostels.com later decides to use cookies, they will not and can not be used to personally identify you in any way.

**Virtual Bulletin Board**

In order to post to the Virtual Bulletin Board we ask that our readers submit a verifible email address. We have found that this procedure greatly reduces the amount of SPAM and stupid messages on the board. If you register and post messages to the Virtual Bulletin Board your email address will be publicly available to anyone reading the Hostels.com site. If you are concerned about this, we suggest that you either get an anonymous email address (i.e. from anonymous email sites like hotmail.com or yahoo.com) or you do not use this feature of the Hostels.com web site. This is the only place that your email address might be revealed, but only if you use this feature.
