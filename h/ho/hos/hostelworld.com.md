# Hostelworld.com - Secure Online Bookings at Hostels Worldwide

Hostelworld.com realises some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites over the Internet. Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy. Hostelworld.com and its associated companies respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with this website. Any information which is provided by you to Hostelworld.com via this website or otherwise will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and/or such amending or replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time. 

###### INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING

> For us to process a booking for you, we require some information from you. This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and email address. Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the site, we require your credit or debit card details so we can guarantee your beds when you pay your deposit.

###### WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION

> We are required to send your information to the travel services provider with which you booked travel services so that the travel service provider knows who you are and when you will use its travel services. We give your name, your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your credit card details and of course, the details of your booking. The travel service provider requires this information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All travel service providers on whose behalf we facilitate bookings have agreed to the Hostelworld.com terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.
