# Host4ASP.NET Privacy policy - Host4ASP.NET

Host4ASP.NET declares great importance to customer’s privacy protection. This privacy policy shows how we collect and use customers’ personal information. Customers who access the Sites or Services consent to our privacy policy by default.  
 

**Information Disclosure**  
 

Host4ASP.NET promises not to disclose or share customers’ personal information with the third party vendors without permission, except for special conditions when we need to provide necessary information to resolve a service request, to comply with federal or state law or subpoenas, or to comply with liquidation or mergers and acquisition-related activities.  
 

**Aggregate Statistics**  
 

In special circumstances, such as doing a survey, Host4ASP.NET may share aggregate statistics, but not personally identifiable information, with partners or other third parties.   
 

**Personal Information**  
 

Host4ASP.NET provides online purchasing service. As long as customers complete the online order forms, they can experience our hosting services. Customers need to record all their personal contact and account information when filling out our forms. Host4ASP.NET promises that we only use customers’ contact and account information to provide hosting services.  
 

**Security**  
 

Host4ASP.NET takes Customer’s information security seriously by utilizing standard security measures to prevent Customer Data from unauthorized access. These measures (including policies, employee training, physical access and system protocols and mechanisms) contribute to the secure exchange and transmission of sensitive data. In particular, sensitive information, such as credit card numbers collected for financial transactions, is encrypted before the transmission.   
 

Host4ASP.NET has to declare that we cannot predict the unexpected cases, such as loss, misuse, and alteration of the data or whatever. But we still try our best to protect the security of customer’s information. In case of an accident, Host4ASP.NET will inform the affected customer of transgression by email, fax, or, if necessary, U.S. Mail. Generally speaking, Host4ASP.NET will send the notification promptly, unless some unexpected case happens, for example, the notification stands to impede a criminal investigation. Under such circumstances, Host4ASP.NET may have to wait until such a notification no longer compromises the investigation.  
 

**Service Announcement**  
 

In case that customer service may be affected by scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, we may need to send out a strictly service-related announcement. These emails are not optional and are more likely to act as a professional notification rather than promotion.  
 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
 

Host4ASP.NET is dedicated to maintaining the integrity of our Customer’s privacy. But in some special conditions, such as suspended or reported fraudulent and/or illegal behaviors which may result in or probable to result in a subpoena, court order, or another applicable legal process, we may disclose the needed personal information. 

This Privacy Policy is only to be applied to Customer data collected by Host4ASP.NET. The websites linked to by Host4ASP.NET are not, nor should they ever be assumed, associated with or regulated under this Privacy Policy. And we encourage your further inspection of the Privacy Policy of any website that collects your personal information.  
 

**Customer Responsibility**  
 

It’s important to note that Customers should take the responsibility to safely store their login information, like user names and passwords, or any other information necessary to access private information maintained within the Host4ASP.NET systems.

We have to note that there are some programs, such as key-loggers and viruses that can intercept the information from the computers used to enter your Host4ASP.NET account. So Customers should be cautious when using computers other than your own one, especially on those public computers used by different people.

**Safe Harbor**  
 

Host4ASP.NET complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which are put forward by the U.S. Department of Commerce, concerning the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries or Switzerland. Host4ASP.NET has certified that it complies with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. We are dedicated to resolving any complaints about the privacy, collection, or use of your personal information. Customers who have inquiries or complaints about this privacy policy should first contact Host4ASP.NET at support@Host4ASP.NET.com.

Host4ASP.NET has been further devoted to referring unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU and Switzerland Safe Harbor Program, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you don’t receive prompt acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not resolved satisfactorily by Host4ASP.NET, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR website at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.

**Policy Changes**  
 

Host4ASP.NET may upgrade this privacy policy at any time. Once upgraded, we will renew the "Last update" date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of this website and hosting service indicates that you understand and agree to this privacy policy as well as its updates.

Lastly, if there’s any question about this policy and its implementation, please send an email to **support@host4asp.net**. Our sales team is willing to help you out.
