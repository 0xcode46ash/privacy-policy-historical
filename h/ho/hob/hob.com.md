**Do I have to provide personal information?**  
You can visit HOB.com as a guest while remaining anonymous by not providing any personal information to us. Although, without this information, you will not be able to fully access all of the features and functionality of the site. However, our servers automatically collect _some_ limited information about your visit that is _not_ personally identifiable to you. Some of this information includes your IP address (so that we may diagnose problems with our servers, better administer our website, help us identify your website visit with us, and to gather broad demographic information which is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis), Internet browser type, computer operating system, and the domain name of your ISP. Additionally, our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart (if applicable) and to make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes related to providing you with relevant information.

These forms require users to give us contact information (like name and email address), demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level), and other applicable information (e.g., credit card information in the case of online store purchases). This information is used to send out prizes to contest winners and merchandise for online store purchases, to contact the visitor when necessary, and to send out information about our company or promotional material from some of our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the instructions outlined in "Correct/Update & Choice/Opt-out" section below.
