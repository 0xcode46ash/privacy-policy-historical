# Privacy Policy

I will never sell or give away your email address, or any other personal information, for any reason whatsoever. 

The Hoax-Slayer Newsletter email notification service uses a double opt-in subscription system that ensures that you really did want to subscribe. The email address that you provide when subscribing is used solely for delivering the monthly notification email and administrative emails such as subscription and unsubscription notices. The subscription process is outlined below: 

  1. Access the simple online subscription form available on the [Subscription Options](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/subscription-options.shtml) page and in the left column of most other pages on the site (including this one).
  2. Enter your email address, and click the button. All being well, you will receive a confirmation email.
  3. Finalize the subscription by using the link provided in the confirmation email. When you follow this link, by clicking it or copying and pasting it into your browser address bar, your email address will be immediately added to the list of subscribers and you will receive a "Welcome" email confirming your subscription.



If you decide that you no longer wish to receive Hoax-Slayer Newsletter notification emails, unsubscribing is a simple process. There are two ways to unsubscribe:

  1. Click the link at the bottom of every notification email and enter your email address into the form provided. Once you have submitted your email address via the unsubscribe form, your address will be immediately removed from the list of subscribers.
  2. Visit the alternative [Unsubscribe Page](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/unsub.html) and follow the instructions. A direct link to the Unsubscribe Page is also included in notification emails.



Once the unsubscription process is completed, your email address will no longer be listed in the subscriber database. You should receive a final email confirming your unsubscription. If a newsletter notifications mail-out is in progress at the time your unsubscribe, you may also receive one final notification email. However, you will not receive subsequent newsletter notifications or any other emails from me unless I am replying to a personal email you have sent.

Hoax-Slayer is totally anti-spam. I will never send unsolicited advertising email. In fact, I have a personal policy of NEVER buying a product or service as a result of spam email, regardless of its intrinsic worth.

In order to use some services provided on the Hoax-Slayer site it might be necessary to provide information such as your name and email address. These services include the newsletter subscription form, contact form, and the Hoax-Slayer Forums. None of the information you provide will be used for any purpose other than that for which it was originally intended. 

Like many other webmasters, I use a service that records raw statistical information such as the number of visitors to the Hoax-Slayer site, what pages are the most popular and system information such as the operating system and browser used by visitors. The stats service I use on this site is provided by [StatCounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com/). In order to gather this information, StatCounter may send a cookie to your computer. I also use the RSS management service [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/ "FeedBurner") to manage Hoax-Slayer RSS feeds. FeedBurner collects statistical information such as the number of subscribers to a given feed and what feed readers are being used. Any information collected is solely for statistical purposes and is not used to identify individuals in any way.

The Hoax-Slayer website uses advertising to generate revenue. I would never knowingly include advertisements that promote fraudulent products or companies. However, it should be understood that I am in no way responsible for the conduct or reliability of advertisers.

I also participate in a limited number of affiliate marketing programs. The site may include reviews or recommendations for carefully chosen affiliate products. For more details, view the [Hoax-Slayer Affiliate Marketing Policy](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/affiliate-marketing-policy.html).

As an Internet user, online privacy is an important issue for me, in respect to both my privacy and yours. If you have any concerns, comments, or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please email me via the [Hoax-Slayer Contact Form](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/submit-material.html).
