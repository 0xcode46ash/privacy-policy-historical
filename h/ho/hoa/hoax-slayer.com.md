# Privacy Policy

I will never sell or give away your email address, or any other personal information, for any reason whatsoever.

The Hoax-Slayer Newsletter email notification service uses a double opt-in subscription system that ensures that you really did want to subscribe. The email address that you provide when subscribing is used solely for delivering the monthly notification email and administrative emails such as subscription and unsubscription notices. The subscription process is outlined below: 

  1. Access the simple online subscription form available on the [Subscription Options](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/subscription-options.shtml) page.
  2. Enter your email address, and click the button. All being well, you will receive a confirmation email.
  3. Finalize the subscription by using the link provided in the confirmation email. When you follow this link, by clicking it or copying and pasting it into your browser address bar, your email address will be immediately added to the list of subscribers and you will receive a "Welcome" email confirming your subscription.



If you decide that you no longer wish to receive Hoax-Slayer Newsletter notification emails, unsubscribing is a simple process. There are two ways to unsubscribe:

  1. Click the "Change address / Leave mailing list" link at the bottom of every notification email and enter your email address into the form provided. Once you have submitted your email address via the unsubscribe form, your address will be immediately removed from the list of subscribers.
  2. Visit the alternative [Unsubscribe Page](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/unsub.shtml) and follow the instructions.



Once the unsubscription process is completed, your email address will no longer be listed in the subscriber database. You should receive a final email confirming your unsubscription. If a newsletter notifications mail-out is in progress at the time your unsubscribe, you may also receive one final notification email. However, you will not receive subsequent newsletter notifications or any other emails from me unless I am replying to a personal email you have sent. To deliver notification emails to subscribers, I use the service provided by [YourMailingListProvider.com](http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/).

Hoax-Slayer is totally anti-spam. I will never send unsolicited advertising email. In fact, I have a personal policy of NEVER buying a product or service as a result of spam email, regardless of its intrinsic worth.
