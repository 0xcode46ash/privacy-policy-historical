# Privacy Policy

[ ](http://www.cauce.org/index.phtml)

  


Rest assured that any personal information that you submit on this site is safe with me.

I will never sell or give away your email address, or any other personal information, for any reason what so ever. The email address that you provide is used solely for delivering the weekly newsletter and administrative emails such as subscription and unsubscription notices.

The Hoax-Slayer Newsletter uses a double opt-in subscription system that ensures that you really did want to subscribe. This double opt-in process is as follows: 

  1. Access the simple online subscription form available on the home page and several other pages of the site (including this one).
  2. Choose the "Subscribe" radio button, enter your email address, and click the "Submit" button. All being well, you will receive a confirmation email.
  3. Finalize the subscription by using the link provided in the confirmation email. Accessing this link, by clicking or copying and pasting the URL into your browser, will automatically add your email address to the list.



If you decide that you no longer wish to receive Hoax-Slayer, unsubscribing is a simple process. There are two ways to unsubscribe from Hoax-Slayer:

  1. Follow the link provided in the footer of every issue of the ezine. Accessing this link, by clicking or copying and pasting the URL into your browser, will automatically remove your email address from the list.
  2. Re-visit this site and choose the "Unsubscribe" option in the form you used to subscribe in the first place.



Once the unsubscription process is completed, I will never darken your inbox again (grin)! Unless you decide to re-subscribe, of course!

All scripts found on the site that allow you to provide information, such as subscription forms, contact forms and message boards are exclusively hosted on my server. Thus, none of the information you submit is passed through any third party websites or organizations and this enhances your privacy

Hoax-Slayer is totally anti-spam. I will never, ever send unsolicited advertising email! In fact, I have a personal policy of NEVER buying a product or service as a result of spam email, regardless of its intrinsic worth. Furthermore, I will never knowingly recommend or promote a company that employs tactics such as spamming, spyware or false or misleading advertising.

As an Internet user, online privacy is an important issue for me, in respect to both my privacy and yours. If you have any concerns, comments, or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact me using the form below:
