# HM Revenue & Customs: Privacy Policy

## General

Our Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that you may provide via the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) website. Whenever you use this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

##  Ways that we collect information

Some areas of the site require you to actively submit information in order for you to benefit from specific features (such as our range of online services). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.

Some of this information may be personal (information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, email address, phone number etc).

We only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.

Information is also gathered without you actively providing it, through the use of various technologies and methods such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and cookies. These methods do not collect or store personal information.

An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. It is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).

We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, and determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and to administer and improve the site.

##  Cookies

Cookies are small files that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in the cookie directory of your computer. A cookie often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies do not damage your computer. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You do not have to accept cookies. You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Switching off cookies will still allow you to view the majority of information available on our website, however, you will not be able to make full use of our online services.

We use cookies to track usersâ€™ progress through the site, allowing us to make improvements based on usage data. The information in a cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information you submit to our site.

There are two types of cookie. Persistent cookies remain on your computer for a specified time. Our persistent cookies will remain on your computer for 5 years. 

We use persistent cookies to:

  * identify that a user has returned
  * collect information about how the website is used that allows us to make improvements to it



Session-specific cookies are deleted when you leave the website. We use session-specific cookies to:

  * hold the information given while using some of our online services and tools
  * hold your login details when you are logged into our online services

##  Page tagging

We use JavaScript page tags to aggregate and analyse customer usage patterns on our website. This provides us with data on your site usage and behaviour. We use this information to make changes to the layout of the website and to the information in it. This process does not collect any personal or identifiable information about users. You can disable JavaScript on your computer however, disabling JavaScript may affect your ability to access some of our online tools and services.

Sometimes we tag pages on the site when we are promoting various campaigns. These tags are provided by our advertising management partners, DoubleClick and Atlas. These tags enable DoubleClick and Atlas to recognise a unique cookie on your browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our web site. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick and Atlas. With this technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. There is more information about DoubleClick and Atlas - including information about how to opt out of these technologies - on their websites.
