# Privacy Policy - HistoryInOrbit.com

**Introduction**  
This Privacy Policy describes how HistoryInOrbit.com is doing business as HistoryInOrbit.com. HistoryInOrbit.com collects and uses non-personally identifying information from users of the HistoryInOrbit.com website at http://www.HistoryInOrbit.com along with all subdomains, collectively, the Site.

We never knowingly collect or maintain information at or on our Site from those we actually know are under 18 years old, and no part of our Site is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 18 years old. Visitors younger than 18 years of age may NOT use the Site and must LEAVE immediately.

**How we Collect and Use Non-Personally Identifying Information**  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather Web server log file information automatically such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We use this information to administer our Site, understand how visitors navigate through our Site and to enhance your experience while using our Site.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Cookies and web beacons are very small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. HistoryInOrbit.com collects information through cookies and web beacons about your web browsing activities such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referrer page you previously visited, the time you are viewing the page, your browsing environment and your display settings. We use cookies and web beacons on our Site to:

Understand traffic patterns and the number of visitors to the Site and other non-HistoryInOrbit.com websites that we partner with;  
Understand how you use and interact with the Site;  
Improve the HistoryInOrbit.com products and services;  
Optimize your experience on our Site;  
Provide anonymous individual or aggregate auditing, research, modeling and reporting for our advertisers and other partners (no personally identifiable information about you is shared with our advertisers and other partners as part of these activities);  
Provide you relevant advertising and content; and  
Properly manage our Site.

Please note that some cookies may be placed by a third party service provider who performs some of these functions for us. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

If you are concerned about cookies, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. A user refusing cookies can still fully navigate our Site.

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
This Site may contain links to other sites owned by third parties. Your use of each of those sites is at your own risk and is subject to the terms of those sites. HistoryInOrbit.com has no control over sites that are not ours, and HistoryInOrbit.com is not responsible for any changes to or content on them. HistoryInOrbit.com assumes no responsibility for the content of or services offered by linked third-party sites, and makes no representations regarding the accuracy of materials on third-party Web sites. Statements made on third-party Web sites linked to or from this Site reflect only the views of their authors and not of HistoryInOrbit.com. HistoryInOrbit.com’s inclusion on the Site of any third-party content or a link to a third-party site is not an endorsement of that content or third-party site.

**Advertising**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
