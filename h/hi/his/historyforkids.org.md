# Privacy policy - History for Kids!

> ## Historyforkids! is very conscious of the need for extra privacy precautions in a site where many children visit. We therefore do not collect any personal information about anyone who visits the site. Our site statistics software does tell us where people found our site from (mainly Google or Yahooligans!), and which pages were most popular ([Alexander](https://web.archive.org/web/20050519073347id_/http%3A//www.historyforkids.org/learn/greeks/history/hellenistic.htm) and [Egypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20050519073347id_/http%3A//www.historyforkids.org/learn/egypt/index.htm) are always near the top, also [Socrates](https://web.archive.org/web/20050519073347id_/http%3A//www.historyforkids.org/learn/greeks/philosophy/socrates.htm)), and what kind of browser you used (mainly Explorer, which I personally find inexplicable, but there you are). This helps us to design a better site. But we don't know your name or where you live or how old you are, and we don't want to know. Our estimates of who visits Â the site are based on the (extensive) fan mail we have received over the years, and on the survey, which is limited to people over 13 years old, and also doesn't collect names or addresses.
