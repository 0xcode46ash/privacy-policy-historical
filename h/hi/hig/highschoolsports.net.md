Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 10/15/2009
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of this website (the “Site”).
Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while
you are using the Site, and the ways in which we use and share this information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or
that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live
event, via telephone, or through the mail).
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you
agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over our online privacy practices,
is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Because the Web is
an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in
the future, in which case we'll post the revised Privacy Policy on this website and
update the “Last Updated” date to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing
to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as
modified.

How We Collect and Use Information
We may collect and store information, including personally-identifiable
information (such as your name, postal address or email address) or other
information, that you voluntarily supply to us while on our Site. Some examples


of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when
you contact us with questions, information that you post on blogs, discussion
forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, and
information that you electronically submit when you complete an online
registration form to access and use certain features of our Site. We also may
ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial
information) from those users who make purchases or have payment
transactions on our Site.
We collect and may display team rosters and student athlete statistical
information at www.HighSchoolSports.net. This type of data is the same
information that public media suppliers deliver when reporting on athletic
contests. No student data is stored at www.HighSchoolSports.net and no
information other than rosters and student athlete statistical information is
displayed at www.HighSchoolSports.net. Schedule Star Application user
administrators control the display of team rosters and student athlete statistical
information submitted by the user administrator. Our affiliates or we control the
display of team rosters and student athlete statistical information submitted by
our affiliates..
Photographs and Videos can be uploaded to www.HighSchoolSports.net in a
section referred to as The Bleachers. A specific athletic event for a specific team
must be chosen for upload. Captions or other comments are not accepted with
uploads by the general public. Student names are generally not used or
associated with photographs or videos acquired through the upload feature in
The Bleachers for display at www.HighSchoolSports.net. Display of photographs
and video is within our sole discretion.
We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is
generated automatically as you navigate through the Site. For example, we may
collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows
us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to
measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser
software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are
small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping
purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us
deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user
trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your
preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference
information before. This Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic
files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users
who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.
The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected
by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider,
on our behalf.
We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a
variety of ways, including, for example, to process your registration request,


provide you with services and communications that you have requested, send
you email updates and other communications, customize features and
advertising that appear on the Site, deliver our Site content to you, measure Site
traffic, measure user interests and traffic patterns, and improve the Site and the
services and features offered via the Site.
In addition, we may use any information submitted by or collected from you via
the Site for any purpose related to the Site, including to contact you for customer
service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Site or
the services offered over our Site, and to send you administrative notices and
any other communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
We also may provide your information to our affiliates or to third parties, including
our third party service providers, contractors and advertisers, for purposes
related to Site administration and operation. For example, if you use a credit or
debit card to complete a transaction on our Site, we may share your personal
information and credit card number with a credit card processing and/or a
fulfillment company in order to complete your transaction, or such service
provider(s) may collect that information from you directly, on our behalf.
We also reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the
information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way
and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with
information about products and services that may be of interest to you. In some
cases we will use and/or share only non-personally identifiable information, but in
other cases we may use and share personally identifiable information. If you do
not wish your personally identifiable information to be used for these purposes,
you must send a letter to the Privacy Policy whose address is listed at the end of
this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of personally identifiable
information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to
third parties.
Our Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products
and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control.
When you access another website or purchase products or services from a third-
party, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the
operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.
We also make some content, products and services available through our Site
through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of
our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products
and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you
provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made
available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider
partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy
policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your
information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If
you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider
partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information.


We are an affiliate of the Topix online news service, which enables us to provide
you with access to Topix products and services through a co-branded Topix site.
When you provide information through the co-branded Topix site, we may use
the information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and Topix may use the
information consistent with its own privacy policy (available at www.topix.com).
Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors
if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is
reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our Terms
of Service; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us,
our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors,
other users, and/or the public.
Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.
In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or our Site is acquired
by another company, information about our Site users may be among the
transferred assets.
Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting
We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and/or a third-party
ad serving software, to collect non-personally identifiable information about site
users and site activity, and we may use this information to, among other things,
serve targeted advertsements on this site. The information collected allows us to
analyze how users use the site and to track user interests, trends and patterns,
thus allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements to users.
We also may use third-party service providers to target and serve some of the
advertisements you see on the pages of our Site, and these providers likewise
may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-
personally identifable information from our Site. These service providers may use
that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar non-personally identifable
information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements on this
Site, and on other websites that participate in our service providers’ advertising
networks, that are tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers. This
information also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s
effectiveness, or for other purposes.
The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting on our Site
does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email
address or telephone number, but it may include the IP address of your
computer.
The use and collection of information by third-party advertising service providers
is governed by the relevant third party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our
privacy policy. If you would like more information about the information collection
practices of a particular service provider, or if you would like more information on
how to opt out of a service provider’s information collection practices, please click

Information You Post to Blogs, Discussion Forums and Other
Community Posting or Social Networking Areas
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal
information or other private information available for viewing by third parties
online - for example on blogs, discussion forums, or other community posting or
social networking areas of our Site - that information can be seen, collected and
used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-
party use of such information.
Children's Privacy Statement
This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online
collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen,
and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with
respect to such information.
We adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the
guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus, Inc with respect to each of our websites directed at
children. Parents should monitor their children’s online use and instruct their
children never to provide personal information on the Site or on any other site
without their parent’s permission.
If you are under 18, please be sure to read this Privacy Policy with your parents
or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand.
Children under 13 must get their parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before
giving out their email address or any personal information to us or to anyone else
on the Internet.
We do not collect personal information online from children under 13 without
consent of a parent or legal guardian except in special, limited circumstances as
permitted by law. If a child is under 13 and wants to use the Site to access
special features, we might ask that child to “register.” They can often do so
anonymously by just providing a user name and password, but sometimes we
need a child’s first name and email address. When we ask for a child’s first
name, that child is encouraged to use a “screen name” (not their real name) that
only they know. Sometimes we will ask a child to make up a special password so
that only they can see their customized areas on the Site. We may collect
personal information from a child such as a last name, address or email address
when the information is necessary for a particular activity, and only with the
verifiable consent of that child’s parent. If we need more than just a child’s first
name (or screen name) and email address for that child to participate in a
particular online activity, we will ask that child for their parent’s email or mailing
address so that we can notify the parent of their child’s request and get the
parent’s permission. When we ask for the parent’s permission, we will tell the
parent what we will do with the information the parent or the child provides us,
and we will tell the parent how they can review their child’s information and ask


us to delete the information. We do not keep a child’s email address unless the
parent tells us it is okay.
We might collect an email address and first name (or screen name) from a child
under 13 without their parent’s consent, but only in the following special cases:
          •      If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep the child’s email
          address for long enough to respond to them. We delete this information
          from our system after we answer the child’s question.
          •      If a child under 13 signs up for an email newsletter, or other activity
          that requires multiple online contact with the child, we also ask the child
          for a parent’s or legal guardian’s email address so we can notify the
          child’s parent and give the parent an opportunity to opt out.
          •      Occasionally, we have special site activities or promotions like
          sweepstakes or contests that are open to children even if they are under
          13. If a child under 13 signs up for such an activity or promotion, we also
          ask the child for a parent’s or legal guardian’s email address so we can
          notify the child’s parent and give the parent an opportunity to opt out.
If we need more than an email address and first name (or screen name) to enter
a child under 13 in a promotion or allow the child to participate in an activity on
the Site, we will notify that child’s parents, explain what information we need and
why, and generally ask that parent (not the child) to provide it. For instance, we
might ask a parent for their mailing address so that we can send to that parent,
for their child, any prizes their child wins, or for a parent’s telephone number so
that we can tell that parent when their child has won. Any information a parent or
a child gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our
database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any
legally required period for keeping such information is complete.
We do not require a child under 13 to disclose more information than is
reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, game or other activity as a
condition of participation. If a parent no longer wishes their child who is under 13
to participate in an email newsletter, that parent can simply click on the link that
is provided for removal or contact us at:
Online Privacy Coordinator
7950 Jones Branch Drive
McLean, VA 22107
Upon proper identification, parents or legal guardians may review the personal
information we have collected about their child who is under 13, request deletion,
or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information. Click here to print a
copy of our Personal Information Review Access Request, fill it out completely
and mail it to:
Online Privacy Coordinator
7950 Jones Branch Drive
McLean, VA 22107


However, if a parent asks us to delete the information for their child who is under
13, we may have to ask that child not to participate in our activities.
