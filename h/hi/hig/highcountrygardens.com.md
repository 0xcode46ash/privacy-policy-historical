# Customer Service - High Country Gardens

Your Privacy 

At High Country Gardens, we respect your privacy. The information we collect from you allows us to process orders, provide subscriptions to our online newsletter and to make shopping with us easier when you re-visit our site. 

To Help Us Serve You  
To process your merchandise order we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. To send a print catalog, we need to know your name, e-mail address and mailing address. To subscribe to our E-Zine (newsletter) we need only your e-mail address. 

To Continue Shopping with Us  
You may choose to have your own computer browser store information that will allow our website to remember you and your ordering and shipping information. This option is available to you on our shopping cart. 

Postal Addresses  
Sometimes we share our customer postal mailing list with carefully screened companies that offer products and services we believe you may enjoy. If you do not wish to be included, please indicate this in our shopping cart when checking out. You may also e-mail us at privacy@highcountrygardens.com (please include your full name and complete address). 

E-mail addresses  
The e-mail addresses you provide us for your plant order, catalog requests and E-Zine subscriptions will not be rented or shared with any other Internet company. If in the future we choose to rent or share our customer e-mail addresses, we would include your e-mail address only with your permission. 

Third party cookies and tags  
In order to better serve you, our site uses third party cookies and tags that help us keep track of how we are doing, and how well our site meets the needs of our customers. No personal information about you is shared with these third parties. 

We respect your privacy. Our company conducts business with integrity and good intentions to provide you with the highest quality products and services. You can trust us to honor you as a valued customer.
