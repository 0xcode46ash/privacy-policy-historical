**Information We Collect About Visitors to Our Web Site**  
When visitors enter our Web site, our Web server recognizes the domain name of their ISP (Internet Service Provider) and the type of computer and browser they have. We cannot recognize individual users, but we do know if visitors are connecting to our Web site from popular ISPs like AOL, Earthlink, and MSN, or if they are connecting from a private company network. 

On an aggregated basis, we track various tallies of Web site traffic. For example, we track referring pages. This is where visitors come from before they reach the HighlightsKids Web site, for instance, many select our Web site from a listing in a search engine. We also track the number of visitors to our site every month. We keep a record of which pages visitors see most often. We cannot, however, trace this information to individual visitors. We use the aggregate information we collect to improve the content, navigation, and performance of our Web site. We use information about individual computers and browsers to provide an optimal experience for our users. We do not share this information with third parties.

Your browser allows you to reject cookies, and software is available from third parties that will allow you to visit our Web site anonymously, although certain site functionalities may be impacted. 

**The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act**  
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), effective as of April 2000, was established by Congress to protect children’s online privacy. COPPA requires that children’s Web site operators adhere to specific guidelines regarding the collection and handling of personally identifiable information about children. For more information about COPPA and your child’s rights to online privacy, visit the FTC’s Kids Privacy Web site for parents at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/adults.htm.

**COPPA Compliance by _Highlights for Children_**  
_Highlights for Children_ has always protected the privacy of children. We do not advertise to children or solicit children for any marketing information. We never knowingly release the names of subscribing children to third parties. This policy applies to our off-line and online business practices.

In regard to COPPA, HighlightsKids.com does not collect any personally identifiable information from children. We do not knowingly provide any information about children to third parties.

There are certain features, such as Giggles Galore that ask users to submit their first name, last initial, age, and state. All information provided by users is screened before posting to ensure that users are not giving personally identifiable information. 

We will only send e-mail when the child writes to us through Contact Us or E-mail the Editors, to reply to a child’s question. Any personally identifiable information submitted by the child will be deleted from our files. 

All information posted by users of HighlightsKids.com is moderated. This means that we read all messages before public posting. Any personally identifiable information will be deleted before posting. We may decide not to post a message we deem inappropriate for any reason.
