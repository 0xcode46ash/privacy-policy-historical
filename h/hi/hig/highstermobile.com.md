# Privacy Policy - Highster Mobile

**Highster Mobile Respects Your Privacy**

**Data Protection**

Your data from your mobile device is protected by the most secure Premium SSL Certificate available. All data and information that is transmitted is done only through Premium SSL Certificate.

The primary reason why SSL is used is to keep sensitive information sent across the Internet encrypted so that only the intended recipient can understand it. This is important because the information you send on the Internet is passed from computer to computer to get to the destination server. Any computer in between you and the server can see your credit card numbers, usernames and passwords, and other sensitive information if it is not encrypted with an SSL certificate. When an SSL certificate is used, the information becomes unreadable to everyone except for the server you are sending the information to. This protects it from hackers and identity thieves.

**Credit card details**

www.highstermobile.com will not share any information regarding personal credit card information.

**External Sites**

www.highstermobile.com is not responsible for the content of external internet sites. You are advised to read the privacy policy of external sites before disclosing any personal information.

**Cookies**

**Remember The Risks Whenever You Use The Internet**
