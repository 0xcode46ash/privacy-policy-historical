**Information Collected and How it is Used**

**Information collected if you only browse this site.**   
If you do nothing during your visit to our Web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

  1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (for example, _xcompany.com_ or _yourschool.edu_ ); 
  2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
  3. The date and time you visited this site; 
  4. The Web pages or services you accessed at this site; and 
  5. The Web site you visited prior to coming to this Web site. 



The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by Highline Community College only to improve the content of our Web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. Highline Community College analyzes the Web site logs to determine how our Web site is being used, so that we may continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

**What we collect if you volunteer information.  
** If during your visit to our Web site you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following additional information will be collected:

  * The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail. 
  * Information volunteered in response to a survey. 
  * Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose. 



The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our Web site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action.

The use of survey information will be described as part of that survey. Information from other on-line forms is used for access to on-line student services, participation in instructional activities (such as on-line quizzes or on-line discussions), searches of library and other databases, and other activities as described in the specific application.

**Personal Information and Choice**

You may choose whether to provide personal information online.

Personal information is information about a person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. 

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse the Highline Community College Web site and read or download most information provided on the site.

Choosing not to participate in these activities may impair your ability to use on-line student services, participate in surveys, and participate in on-line instructional activities. On-line student services may be conducted using Touch-tone registration, mail, or telephone, as described in the section below on that specific service. Information about participating in surveys is available by contacting the office sponsoring the survey (identified on each individual survey), though some surveys will not be available off-line. Information about participating in instructional activities off-line is available by contacting the instructor, though some instructional activities may not be available off-line.

If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Public Records Officer as shown in the Contact Information section of this statement.

Highline Community College web site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

**Public Access to Information**

In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws. 

All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. Statue RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that: 

> Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.

In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agencyâ€™s disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
