# High-Logic - Privacy Policy

###### [Home](https://web.archive.org/index.html)Privacy Policy

###### 

#### Updated: Tuesday, August 3, 2004

### Philosophy

## We are only interested in collecting and retaining the information that is necessary to effectively run our business. We respect your right to keep your personal information private.

### IP Addresses & Cookies

## High-Logic uses IP addresses for statistical and system administration purposes. IP addresses are anonymously logged to track a users session. We do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. This means that a users session will be logged but that user will remain anonymous to us.

## Our Forum uses cookies to keep track of registered members preferences and to provide you with information on posts since your last visit. We do not use this information to track your individual behavior.

### Forum Participation

## Please note that information you place in your "profile" on the Forum can be viewed by the general public. If you do not wish to make your email address or personal information public, you can still register for the Forum. You should omit any personal information from the "profile" that you don't want seen by the general public.

## By participating in the Forum, you agree that we may reproduce any of your contributions elsewhere on the website or in our newsletters. However, we will only publish the information that you make public.

### E-mail

## We will not sell your e-mail address, nor do we provide it to advertisers or mass marketers. In other words, you will never receive junk mail based on information you submit directly to us.

### Newsletter (opt-in mailing list) 

## Information gathered from e-newsletter subscriptions is used to provide you with the e-mails you have requested and to allow us to customize future e-mail and e-newsletter offerings. You may remove yourself from our electronic mailing lists by following the directions included in each e-mail or at [this page](https://web.archive.org/newsletter.html).

### Ordering

## In our own customer database we store only your name, e-mail address and order details, but not your address and phone number. All our online orders are encrypted and secured and processed by Kagi and RegNow so we never receive your credit card information. See [Kagi's privacy page](http://www.kagi.com/purchase/purchase_privacy.html) and [RegNow's privacy page](http://www.regnow.com/privacy.html) for more information.
