## PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY

Internet Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personal information private. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information you have shared.  It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in seeking or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use of our Web Site.

## THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

A. Anonymous Information. You can always browse the Public Site and search for posted positions without providing any personal information to HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general information about the number of users browsing the Web Site, the number of users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web Site. This information is collected anonymously and only in the aggregate.  We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to the institutions posting positions on our Web Site, to publicize our Web Site and to further develop our Web Site to maximize the benefits realized by our users.

B. Personally Identifiable Information. HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable information when you register for a personal account through My HigherEdJobs, create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide. "Opt-in" services are only offered when the user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence, academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work experience. We may also request other information such as your zip code, career level, highest degree earned, salary level and professional affiliations.  Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for demographic purposes. We may use that information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the opt-out procedures contained on the Web Site.  WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN IS OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal My HigherEdJobs account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the Restricted Site. We request certain personal information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education. We include this information, when and only if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers to search for potential candidates online.  In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover letter in the resume textbox. There are two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:

  1. You can create and store your resume on our database, but _not_ allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other employer-subscribers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position online, but it will _not_ be searchable through our resume database.
  2. You can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume database. You may elect to have your personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching our database, or not have any personal contact information disclosed. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, university and other subscribers who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted on our Web Site. Please note that once you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our paying subscribers. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage, Inc. is not responsible.
