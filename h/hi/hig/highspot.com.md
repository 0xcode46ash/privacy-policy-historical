Highspot is a participant in the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement with respect to personal data transferred from the EU member countries and from Switzerland to the U.S. For more information about the Safe Harbor program and to view our certification, please visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor](http://export.gov/safeharbor/) website.

As of the effective date of this policy, the U.S. Department of Commerce has advised that it continues to administer the Safe Harbor program despite an [adverse judgment](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=169195&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=125031) by the European Court of Justice on October 6, 2015.  We are maintaining our Safe Harbor certification for now pending U.S. and EU government action on a new Safe Harbor framework.
