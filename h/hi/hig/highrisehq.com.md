# Highrise Privacy Policy

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log access to all accounts by IP address, so we can verify unauthorized access (for as long as the logs are kept).

## Identity & Access

When you sign up for Highrise, we ask for your name, company name, and email address so we can send invoices, updates, and other essential information. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission, either.

When you write Highrise with a question or to ask for help, we’ll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages, we’ll track that for statistical purposes (like for measuring conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info: 

  * To provide products or services you’ve requested, with your permission.
  * To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service,](https://web.archive.org/terms/) or as otherwise required by law.
  * If Highrise is acquired by or merged with another company, besides our parent company, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



## Law Enforcement

Highrise won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Encryption

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data isn’t encrypted while it’s live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor

We use annual self-assessments to assure compliance within the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland. Our privacy policy above serves as our statement of adherence to the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Highrise certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>. We have answers to some frequently asked questions about Safe Harbor [here](https://web.archive.org/privacy/safe-harbor-questions).

## Safe Harbor Privacy Complaints

## 

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Highrise: at [support@highrisehq.com](mailto:support@highrisehq.com) or by mail at Highrise HQ LLC, 30 North Racine Avenue #200, Chicago, IL 60607 USA. We will thoroughly investigate the matter internally and make every effort to attempt to resolve the issue quickly.

We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint. 

## Changes & Questions

Highrise may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting [support@highrisehq.com](mailto:support@highrisehq.com) or by mail at: Highrise HQ LLC, 30 North Racine Avenue #200, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.
