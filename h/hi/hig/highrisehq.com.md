# Highrise Privacy Policy

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. While Highrise processes your data, we’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you ask us to. We log access to all accounts by IP address, browser and operating system so we can verify unauthorized access (for as long as the logs are kept).

## Identity & Access

When you sign up for Highrise, we ask for your name, company name, and email address so we can send invoices, updates, and other essential information. When you invite a new user, we ask for their name and email address so we can verify their access to you account. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements unless you've publicly shared the information or expressly provided us permission.

Users of Highrise can store any type of information in Highrise, but Highrise does not access or share that data, and does not know what type of data you or other users are storing. The data is only used by the account owner and invited users as they intend to use it.

When you write Highrise with a question or to ask for help, we’ll keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our marketing pages and use Highrise, we’ll track that for statistical purposes (like for measuring conversion rates, to test new designs, and to determine which features utilized the most). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info: 

  * To provide products or services you’ve requested, with your permission.
  * To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service,](https://web.archive.org/terms/) or as otherwise required by law.
  * If Highrise is acquired by or merged with another company, besides our parent company, [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



You always have the right to access the personal information we store about you. You can review the personal information you provide to us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your Highrise account, at any time by logging into your account on the website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also contact Lynette Kontny via email at [privacy@highrisehq.com](mailto:privacy@highrisehq.com), mail at: 30 N. Racine Avenue, Suite 200, Chicago, IL 60607, or phone at 847.469.3248. Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us.

Even after you have consented to our collection and use of your personal information, you may opt-out of having your personal data collected or used by us by contacting us via one of the methods described above. Doing so, however, may make it unable for you to utilize the Highrise website or services and may result in us closing your account.

## Cookies

In order to improve our services and the website, and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to you, we and our vendors may use "cookies", "web beacons", and similar devices to track your activities.

Highrise also contains embedded 'share' buttons to enable Users to share content with friends through social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. These sites may set a cookie when you are logged in to their service. We do not control the setting of cookies from these websites. Please check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

## Do Not Track

When you visit a website (such as our site), your browser automatically shares certain information, such as your IP address and other device information. Some of this information may also be sent to third-party content providers (for example: advertisers, website analytic companies, etc.) that provide content on the website. Such sharing may allow the website and/or content providers to track you over time and across multiple websites. Today, many browsers offer Do Not Track plugins that allow you to express a preference that you not be tracked, and that tell websites that you visit, by sending an electronic beacon, this preference. At this time, our site does not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.

## Law Enforcement

While we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, Highrise won’t otherwise hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Encryption

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data isn’t encrypted while it’s live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## Third Parties

You understand that Highrise uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide you with our services. A current list of vendors is available upon request.

In cases of onward transfer to these third parties for data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Highrise is potentially liable should any issues or concerns arise.

## Deleted Data

When you cancel your account, we keep your data on our servers for at least 30 days in case you change your mind. Beyond that we purge account data from our servers on a regular basis. You can specifically request to have your data deleted by contacting us at [support@highrisehq.com](mailto:support@highrisehq.com). Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be purged within 30 days (up until then it's available in the trash can).
