**Does the website use cookies and similar technologies?**

        Cookies are small text files located in your browser directory. When a website is ac-cessed, a cookie that is placed on a device sends information to the browser. Cookies are extremely common and used on a number of websites. In general, the purpose of cookies is to improve the performance of the website and the user's experience in using that web-site, though cookies may also serve advertisements (which we explain below). 

Hilti uses the following types of cookies and similar technologies in connection with this website:

  * Google Analytics (persistent cookie that lasts after you close your browser): This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your com-puter, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transferred to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Before the transfer this information will be anonymized by removing the last octet of your IP address. Google will process this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, com-piling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website ac-tivity and internet usage. Google will not link your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate set-tings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You may further opt-out of the collection of your usage data (including your IP-address) and the processing of the data by Google by downloading and installing the add-on for your current web browser from the following link: [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
  * JsessionID (session cookie that last until you close your internet browser): Hilti uses a cookie that serves to identify the user during his current session on this website. The Jsession ID cookie collects the user’s session ID but does not store any personal data after the user has closed his session and does not transfer any data to third parties.



You can modify your cookies settings, or refuse to accept cookies at all, thus limiting the amount of personal data that we receive about you. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please be aware, however, that you might then not be able to take advantage of some functions and features of the website.

For a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they operate, please read the [All About Cookies website](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Why and with whom do we share personal data?**

For the purposes mentioned above, we may share your personal data with third parties, including other entities of the Hilti group of companies. We do not sell, trade, rent, dis-close, transfer or otherwise share your personal data, unless to the extent described in the following or as agreed by you in a specific context (e.g., where you consenting to other types of data transfers in connection with enrolling for a specific service). Whenever sharing personal data, we do so only in strict accordance with applicable laws. 

Potential recipients of your personal data are listed in the following:

  * Other Hilti group entities and Hilti business partners: We may share your personal data with other entities of the Hilti group of companies (e.g. Hilti Market Organiza-tions responsible for the respective local websites) and with our business partners if there is a legitimate reason to do so (e.g., where a business partner renders parts of services ordered by you such as email service providers) and such sharing is legally permissible. A legal permission exists for instance if you have consented to the sharing of your personal data or if applicable law permits or requires it. In any case where we share your data with other entities of the Hilti group of companies or with our business partners we do so only for specific purposes.
  * Third party service providers: We may employ third party service providers (i.e., companies or individuals engaged by us) to perform certain functions on our behalf and under our instructions. Examples include database management, maintenance services, web analytics, handling in-bound inquiries, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing sales and marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Third party service providers may for instance include IT companies, credit card processors, credit rating agencies or legal, financial and other advisors. Any third party provider will have access only to such personal data needed to perform its specific functions, and only for the purpose of performing these func-tions. We will ensure that any third party service provider is aware of and abides by these obligations. We will also ensure that any third party service provider treats your perso-nal data no less protective as required by applicable data protection laws and that they adopt adequate technical and organizational security measures.
  * Other users of the website: If you use posting, chat, messaging or other interactive functions provided on our website we may disclose your personal data to other users of the website, but only as required in connection with such functions.



  * Courts, law enforcement authorities and regulators: We may share personal data when we believe it necessary to comply with the law, to protect the rights or safety of our website, other users, or third parties (e.g., for fraud protection purposes). Without limitation, this may include cases in which we are required to share personal data by the law or binding order of courts, law enforcement authorities or regulators. We will carefully determine the permissibility of providing personal data in each such context, paying particular attention to the type of request, types of data affected and any im-pact that a disclosure of personal data would have on the user affected. Should we decide to disclose personal data in such context we will also consider ways of reducing the scope of the disclosure, for instance by redacting the information pro-vided.
  * Buyers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell all or parts of our website or business. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets, but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Website Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.



 **Will personal data be transferred abroad?**

Recipients of your personal data may be located in any country. This may include coun-tries where applicable data protection laws provide a lesser degree of protection than your home country. For instance, if you are located within the EU/EEA or Switzerland, the country where the recipient is located may not qualify as a safe country within the notion of the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) or the Federal Data Protection Act of Switzerland. In such case, Hilti will nevertheless ensure an adequate level of protection for your data, for instance by ensuring that the recipient abides by the principles of the Safe Harbor (for recipients in the US) or by requiring the recipient to enter into so-called EC Model Clauses, which are sets of contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the purpose of adducing adequate safeguards to personal data in connec-tion with cross-border transfers. 

**What else do we do to protect your personal data?**

Hilti understands the importance of data security and we want your browsing and pur-chasing experience with us to be as safe as possible. We have implemented reasonable safeguards and precautions to protect your personal data, including technical and organi-zational measures against unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or ac-cidental destruction, and accidental loss, both in an online and offline context.

Also, please understand that, while we strive to protect your personal data against poten-tial risks and exposures, there is no absolute security in the online sphere. Hence, we ask you to support our IT security efforts by not disclosing any data on our website that is particularly sensitive or not required in the specific context. In this context, please note that credit card credentials will not be stored absent your explicit permission. Further-more, you can help us protecting your personal data by signing off when you finished us-ing login-protected areas of the website.   
**  
How long do we retain personal data?**

Your personal data is not retained by us for longer than necessary for the legally permis-sible purposes for which they were collected, as required under applicable retention poli-cies and/or as required or permitted in accordance with applicable law. Transcripts from online chats with our customer service are usually retained no longer than for 30 days.

**What privacy choices do you have?  
**  
You have a variety of choices regarding which data we may collect, process and use about you and for which purposes. Some of these choices include the following:
