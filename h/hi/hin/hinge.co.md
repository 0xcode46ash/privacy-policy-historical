_Last revised December 10, 2013_

**PURPOSE OF POLICY:** This Policy describes how Cleod9, Inc. (“us,” “we” or “Hinge”) collects, uses and discloses personal information from you when you visit and use the Hinge website and Facebook application (the “Site”). This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy. 

**NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN:** We require users to be at least 13 years of age. We do not intend for anyone under the age of 13 to use any of the features or services we offer from the Site, and we certainly do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online.

For example, that may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, email addresses, other contact information, optional demographic information, listing love interests, recommending possible love interests for others, feedback, rating and voting. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:** When you visit or make use of the Site we may collect some information about you automatically. For example, our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The Site may also gather “traffic data” that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For mobile devices, we also collect device-specific information such device type, operating sustem, UUID and device tokens that allow us to diagnose issues and send device-specific notifications. You may also elect to share other information automatically such as geolocation.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION:** We will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services offered by us, with third-party vendors, consultants and service providers who need access to this data to carry out their work for us, to protect the rights or property of Hinge, in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Hinge’s employees, customers or any other person, to the extent required during the negotiation of a merger, sale, financing or acquisition, or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify your identity, to check your qualifications, or to follow up with transactions initiated on the Site. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, or to send you additional information about Hinge. 

**ACTIVITY WITHIN THE SITE:** We use your information to analyze our Site traffic, to diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.

Promotions or advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our site. 

**SOCIAL NETWORK SHARING:** Some of the features of the Site are social by design and allow you to publicly share information about yourself and your activities such as your level of activity and participation with the Site; activities performed or rankings, rewards, recognition and virtual items earned or received as a gift from other Site users; and comments, posts and invitations to people within your social network. We will also share some of your information with social networks you are a member of or on which the Site is hosted on and we are not responsible for their use of your information.
