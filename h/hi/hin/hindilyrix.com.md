## Personal information

In general, you can visit hindilyrix.com on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at %%company%% that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.

Each participant’s opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of %%company%%.

## Other %%company%% Web Site Notices

In some cases, specific %%company%% websites may contain other notices about their use and the information practices applicable to those sites.

## Our Worldwide Practices

%%company%% is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.

Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.

We may share your personal information within %%company%% and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.

Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries %%company%% will still handle information in the manner we describe here.

## Information Security and Quality

We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.

## Supplementing Information

From time to time we may supplement information you give us via an %%company%% website with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.

## Use of Suppliers

In some cases %%company%% uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is %%company%%’s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with %%company%%’s policies.

## Mergers and Acquisitions

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, %%company%% decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is %%company%%’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

## Cookies and Other Technologies

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on %%company%% websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as “clickstream data.” %%company%% or others on %%company%%’s behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some %%company%% pages use cookies, sent by %%company%% or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some websites may not work properly.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See Online Advertising below

## Service Quality Monitoring

Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is %%company%%’s general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.

## Online Advertising

Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads. These companies may collect and use information about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. After it is collected the information is aggregated so it is not identifiable to a specific individual. If, however, you would prefer that these companies not collect such information, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and follow the “opt-out” instructions.

## Personalized URL Link

On occasion, we may personalize and customize websites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with %%company%% and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these websites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these websites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a website registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain website.

If you choose to visit one of these websites, you are agreeing to let %%company%% collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with %%company%%. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.

## Disclosures Required By Law

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
