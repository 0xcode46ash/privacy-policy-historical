_**Information on visitors**_ _ ****_   
During the course of any visit to a HIT Entertainment web site, the pages you see, along with something called a "cookie", are downloaded to your computer. Most, if not all, web sites do this, because cookies allow the web site publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better service and assists us to analyse the profile of our visitors.

**_What is a cookie?_**   
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. HIT Entertainment cookies do not contain any personal identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as personalisation. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser.

Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. If you set the browser to not accept cookies, it will result in certain personalised services not being provided to that user.

_**Web Beacons**_   
Our Web pages contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "Web beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our Web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Web site usage. The Web Beacon system we use to collect this information is called HITBOX ([www.hitbox.com](http://www.hitbox.com/)) provided by Websidestory, Inc., a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 

**Computer Profiles**  
Through the HITBOX technology, we also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we accumulate visitor data relating to referring domains, the type of browsers used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98), screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. We also record number of visits, paths taken and time spent on sites and pages. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall Web site or Internet usage trends.

**_Submitting personal information_**   
When you supply any personal information to HIT Entertainment (e.g., for competitions, or email feedback, or personalised services) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we deal with that data. We must collect the information fairly (details on why we require information will be requested on the actual web pages); we must let you know how we will use it; and we must tell you in advance if we decide to pass the information on to anyone else. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of a personalised service when you no longer wish to continue your registration as a personalised user. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

**_Direct marketing and user surveys_**   
As HIT Entertainment services expand, there will be more opportunities to enhance the services provided to you. From time to time we may send you details of other HIT products and services that may be of interest to you.

**_Users under 13 years of age_**   
Children can surf HIT Entertainment sites, view content, and play some games without any personally identifiable information being collected. However, in some areas it is necessary to collect personally identifiable information from children to allow participation in an activity (like entering a contest) or to communicate with our community (via e-mail or message boards).

HIT Entertainment believes it is good policy not to collect more personally identifiable information from children 13 and younger than is necessary for them to participate in our online activities. In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 13 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need. 

The only personally identifiable information we collect from children is his/her first name, parent's e-mail address, and child's birth date. We collect birth date to validate a Guest's age. We may also collect personal information, like a pet's name, to help Guests remember their Log-in Name and Password if they forget them. 

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information HIT Entertainment holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests.) Please address requests to [contactus@hitentertainment.com](mailto:contactus@hitentertainment.com) in order for the information to be deactivated.

_**Credit Cards**_   
Using credit cards on the web is as safe as giving your credit card details over the phone. All HIT Entertainment partners and commerce technologies use secure systems and take the security of financial data very seriously.
