**Children's Online Privacy Protection**

The Hitwise service is directed towards adult business users. Hitwise does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should not use the Hitwise website or submit information to Hitwise.

**Data Collected Through Partnerships**

Hitwise’s principal business is driven by the collection of consumer data, including non-identifying internet browsing data, from data partners (and not directly from end-users), including:

  * **Internet Service Providers (ISPs).** We partner with ISPs operating across a wide range of metropolitan and regional areas. These ISPs provide Experian with browsing data from their users. 


  * **Internet User Panels.** We partner with consumer research companies which have assembled panels of consumers who have agreed to the collection and sharing of their internet browsing and/or other data (such as in response to surveys), in return for incentives, e.g. points for rewards programs. 


  * **Software Vendors.** We also partner with global software providers (e.g., toolbar providers) who provide us with browsing data of their end-users who have agreed to have such data shared with market research companies like Hitwise.



**The Data.** Generally, the data collected includes browsing data (e.g., URLs visited). Hitwise does not intend to collect personally identifiable information from its data partners and takes steps to avoid collecting or receiving such data. Specifically, Hitwise has developed a proprietary filtering solution, which it provides to data partners, that seeks to expunge personal information before the partner provides any collected data to Hitwise.

**Use of the Data**. Hitwise uses the partner-collected data in the services that it provides to its customers, including to provide marketing and behavioral insights to our customers and perform market research and other analytics.  We do not sell or rent data to third parties in a manner that identifies individuals/consumers.

**Changes**

Any changes that Hitwise makes to this Privacy Policy shall be posted on the Experian corporate website and, where appropriate with material changes, we may also notify you via email.
