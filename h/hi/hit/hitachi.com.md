# HITACHI : About Personal Information Protection

  
  


  


As a global supplier that can provide total solutions, Hitachi, Ltd. handles a variety of information: including our own technical information, and information entrusted to us by customers. Given this situation, and to ensure that such information is treated with the respect it deserves, Hitachi, Ltd. has established an information control system and is implementing it thoroughly.  
In light of these issues, together with the specification of rules and establishment of a management system, Hitachi, Ltd. has fixed the personal information protection policy given below, informed executive staff and workers, and is striving to protect personal information appropriately by following this policy.

Etsuhiko Shoyama  
President and Chief Executive Officer

For Hitachi, Ltd., personal information is information that is related to existing persons and that can be used to identify specific persons (for example, names, birth dates, numbers assigned to individuals, symbols or other marks, images, or voice recordings, and relevant information). This includes information that cannot be used to identify individuals by itself, but can be used to identify individuals by easy cross-referencing with other data. Personal information is not limited just to information that can identify individuals, but also includes all information that indicates facts, decisions, or evaluations relating to a person's attributes (such as a person's height or build, finances, work type, or position).  
Based on the Personal Information Protection Policy given below, Hitachi, Ltd. will pay detailed attention to, and expend the utmost efforts on, protecting and managing such information.

This "About Personal Information Protection" document establishes the handling of personal customer information by Hitachi, Ltd.
