Hi, my name's Cringely, and I am powerless over my Google addiction. ("Hi, Cringely.")

If there actually were a 12-step group called Googler's Anonymous, I think millions of us would join -- as long as it wasn't run by Google.

Last week, with the grace and solemnity of a god descending to earth to bestow favor upon us puny humans, Google announced changes to its data retention policy: Starting next year the search giant would now only hold onto all of your search data and your IP address for 9 months instead of 18 months. And thus the bowing and scraping in the mainstream press began: All hail mighty Google, lord of all data.

Four computer discs containing the details of 17,990 current and former staff were lost in July when they were sent between Whittington Hospital NHS Trust in north London and McKesson, a firm providing IT payroll services.

They contained the names, dates of birth, national insurance numbers, start dates and pay details of all staff of Whittington Hospital NHS Trust, Islington Primary Care Trust, Camden Primary Care Trust and Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust.

They also contained the addresses of some staff, although Whittington trust insisted they did not contain anyone's personal bank account details. The trust said the discs went missing when an envelope they were in was placed in a post tray marked "recorded delivery" on Tuesday 22 July. But there was no record of the discs being sent.

Taliban fighters targeting British troops in Afghanistan are using the latest ‘internet phones’ to evade detection by MI6, security sources said last night.

Skype, a popular piece of consumer software that allows free calls to be made over the web, has been adopted by insurgents to communicate with cells strung out across the country.

Unlike traditional mobile calls, which can be monitored by RAF Nimrod spy planes, Skype calls – the commercial application of a technology called Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) – are heavily encrypted. Voice calls are broken into millions of pieces of data before being sent down the line and reassembled by the other caller’s computer.

By my count, over half a billion records of personal information have been exposed or mishandled in the past eight years. And these are only from breaches where a record count has been publicly revealed.

That's more than the population of the European Union, and more than the number of people living in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and all of Central America and the Caribbean combined. My count of 530 million is more than double the 244 million records cited on Privacyrights.org. So how did I arrive at that figure?

There are a number of Web sites where you can find information about data breaches, including Computerworld's privacy page, Attrition.org, the Identity Theft Resource Center, blogs, government agencies and privacy newsletters such as the International Association of Privacy Professionals' "Daily Dashboard". For my summer project this year, I tabulated the data from all of these sources. I added them to files I'd been keeping since 2000, which included data on breaches stretching back to 1995. An intern, Emily Prather, Googled the Fortune 500 companies for news of breaches that didn't make these lists. Add to these several dozen notification letters received by friends and family, and we tallied about 1,500 breaches.

LetsCall.Me is a smart new service for giving out your contact information to others without actually revealing it. At sign-up you get a special vanity URL and the option to have it direct callers to whatever number you provide. People who have your URL and want to call you can simply enter in their phone number and it will call that number to connect them to yours.

Unlike some other services that offer de-centralized calling (see GrandCentral, Jaxtr, JaJah, and iNumbr), LetsCall.Me preserves the caller's number so you can see it before picking up. I had my brother help me test this and he was a little confused to be calling Palm Springs, Calif., whereas I knew it was him because he was in my phone book.

A Web site sponsored by elected officials includes Social Security numbers and other data for thousands of Iowans including Gov. Chet Culver.

IowaLandRecords.org is drawing sharp criticism from watchdog groups, which say it is putting Iowans at risk for identity theft. Culver's spokesman, Troy Price, said he is concerned and the governor's office is looking into the Web site.

IowaLandRecords.org, includes home mortgage records and other documents from each of Iowa's 99 counties. The Web site was launched in January 2005 by the Iowa County Recorders Association. Records on the site that are older than six years old typically include Social Security numbers. Newer documents do not include the numbers. One of those affected was West Des Moines resident George Davey.

Important files should be scrubbed from laptops before entering a foreign country, computer security experts warn.

And if travellers must bring critical files, be sure they’re encrypted. David Perry, a former computer security adviser for AOL who’s now with Bay Area-based Trend Micro, logs about 300 days a year on the road with his laptop, about half the time overseas.

Despite constant laptop use, he doesn’t store any critical information on it. “I don’t archive my emails, I don’t use Quicken, I don’t access my bank account, I don’t shop from my laptop. My laptop and my credit card are unacquainted,” said Perry.

A BRITISH data processing firm has launched an urgent review after a staff member sold a computer on eBay containing personal details of a million bank customers. The computer was bought on the online auction site for $75 by Andrew Chapman, an IT manager from Oxford, in central England, who found the information on the computer's hard drive.

It included bank account numbers, phone numbers, mothers' maiden names and signatures of one million customers of American Express, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), the Independent newspaper reported.

It had belonged to data processing company Mail Source which is part of Graphic Data, a company that holds financial information for banks and other organisations. A spokeswoman for Mail Source said the employee who sold the computer had made an "honest mistake" but insisted it had been an "isolated incident".

Google's Street View service apparently thinks your "no trespassing" and "private road" signs are just for decoration.

The service, which gives Web users a driver's perspective of hundreds of cities around the world, has raised the ire of residents who say the images are an invasion of their privacy. Now residents in California's Humboldt County are complaining that the drivers who are hired to collect the images are disregarding private property signs and driving up private roads.

In an episode reported recently by the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, a Street View driver cruised past two "no trespassing" signs to collect images of a residence that is 1,200 feet from the public road. "It isn't just a privacy issue; it is a trespassing issue, with their own photos as evidence," resident Betty Webb told the newspaper. "They really went off the track to get to our address."

In another embarrassing stumble with computerized data, Britain's government confirmed Thursday that a contractor lost a memory device containing information on every prison inmate in England and Wales.

British officials have been humiliated by a series of such blunders that has raised questions about its ability to safeguard personal information of citizens even as it works on final details for an ambitious national identification program and an expanded DNA data base.

Millions of names and personal details from across the country have been reported lost because computers or memory devices went missing over the past year. The latest comes after the government published a report in June on how it hoped to improve data handling practices.

International travellers face having their laptop computers, mobile phones, iPods and USB memory sticks scanned and copied at will by customs officials under a proposed global anti-counterfeiting trade deal.

Japan and the US are pushing for the so-called Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) to be finalised by the end of the year. Participants have kept details of the agreement secret but information has emerged in consultation papers published by an Australian copyright trade body, the Australian Digital Alliance.

A submission by ADA to the Australian government revealed proposals to extend customs' powers to search, seize and destroy material that infringed copyright and the facilities used to produce the copies. Other proposals were to criminalise infringements and to open infringers to higher fines and claims for damages.

Electronic mail sent to the Japanese Consulate General in Hong Kong between Aug. 1 to 7 may have been improperly redirected to third parties due to a glitch at KDDI Hong Kong Ltd., but no internal information from the consulate general was leaked, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.

The glitch at KDDI Hong Kong is believed to have been caused by unauthorized access by hackers into its e-mail system. The Internet service provider said it has fixed the system and taken appropriate security measures, but the consulate general urged that further steps be taken to prevent recurrence, the ministry said.

"As a result, e-mail messages sent to our consulate general between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7 may not have been delivered properly. We ask that you kindly resend them if necessary," the consulate general said in a Japanese statement posted on its Internet home page.

Most people are getting very comfortable with technology. Non-typers have evolved into typers. Non-writers have learned to get by. People once not inclined to make telephone calls now make them without blinking. Using technology, though, may put them at risk either on or off the job site.

Hope Haslam, director of Consulting Services at Epiq Systems Inc., headquartered in Kansas City, Kan., works in the New York City-based eDiscovery Group, which advises corporate and legal clients about large volumes of stored electronic data that might become part of a lawsuit, if it hasn't already.

"We identify relevant data," she says, (which suggests that) "the trend to mix work and life might well be colliding on technology at work and at home or on the road. If someone is on a PDA or laptop or personal machines at home, we can advise the corporation to go out and collect that data. This can be frightening to employees, because there could be some very personal information there."

Someone was attacking women in Fairfax County and Alexandria, grabbing them from behind and sometimes punching and molesting them before running away. After logging 11 cases in six months, police finally identified a suspect.

David Lee Foltz Jr., who had served 17 years in prison for rape, lived near the crime scenes. To figure out if Foltz was the assailant, police pulled out their secret weapon: They put a Global Positioning System device on Foltz's van, which allowed them to track his movements.

Police said they soon caught Foltz dragging a woman into a wooded area in Falls Church. After his arrest on Feb. 6, the string of assaults suddenly stopped. The break in the case relied largely on a crime-fighting tool they would rather not discuss.

Hackers have accessed confidential details of an estimated 5,000 customers of an American banking group.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is notifying affected customers of the breach. 

Details of the breach are contained in a letter that the bank sent to New Hampshire's attorney general. It appears to be one of several letters sent to different states where people's data has been compromised. Written by the bank's senior company counsel, Peter McCorkell, it said, "This letter is to advise you of an information compromise incident which affects residents of New Hampshire.

"Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. has been advised by a reseller of consumer data, including consumer credit bureau data, of suspicious transactions made using Wells Fargo access codes. Our investigation confirmed that a significant number of unauthorized transactions had been made using Wells Fargo's codes. At this time, we do not know how our codes were compromised. We have notified the United States Secret Service, and it is investigating this matter."

The Home office has issued a consultation paper for a new law that would force phone companies, ISPs and network operators to record and store every phone call, web page request and text message.

The information would have to be stored for twelve months by service providers and would be searchable by a wide variety of organisations, including local councils, health authorities and even Ofsted and the Post Office.

A key aspect of the debate, both during the public consultation on, and parliamentary debate about, the code of practice for voluntary retention of data, and also during the debate about the Directive within the European Council and the European Parliament, has been the impact, or potential impact, that retention of communications data has on individuals’ human rights,” the document states.

Google is seeking to draw clear distinctions between the methods it uses to target ad placements based on search queries and a controversial data-mining practice known as deep-packet inspection. The deep-packet technique gathers and stores information on an individual's Web-site visits and Internet usage without first obtaining the user's consent.

"One of our bedrock privacy principles is transparency, by which we mean that we are upfront with our users about what information we collect and how we use it so that they can make informed choices about their personal information," said Alan Davidson, director of public policy and government affairs at Google.

Before Sherri Davidoff flew out to Defcon this year, she made sure to cover up the "Global Hacking Permit 230291" sticker on her laptop with a photo of two adorable puppies. 

She figured it might help things go a little more smoothly at Logan International Airport, where she eventually managed to clear her way through the Transportation Security Administration's security screening and fly out to this week's hacker convention in Las Vegas without using any ID.

The TSA changed its policy in June, barring travelers who refuse to show ID from flying, but allowing cooperative passengers who have lost or otherwise don't have their papers to pass through. Davidoff, an independent security consultant based in Boston, wanted to see how the new TSA system worked.

Parents have admitted to spying on their children online in an attempt to safeguard them from the dangers of social networking websites.

Children as young as eight are being attracted to social networking sites such as Facebook, Myspace and Bebo, with a new study revealing more than 750,000 between the ages of 8 and 12 use one, despite minimum age restrictions of 13 or 14.

The research shows parents are taking matters into their own hands with three quarters snooping on their children online. One in four parents admit to secretly logging on to their child’s social networking page, while the same number have also set up their own page to spy on their kids.

Amazing. The U.S. government has published its policy: they can take your laptop anywhere they want, for as long as they want, and share the information with anyone they want:

> Federal agents may take a traveler's laptop or other electronic device to an off-site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing, as part of border search policies the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed. Also, officials may share copies of the laptop's contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation, data decryption, or other reasons, according to the policies, dated July 16 and issued by two DHS agencies, US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
> 
> [...]
> 
> DHS officials said that the newly disclosed policies — which apply to anyone entering the country, including US citizens — are reasonable and necessary to prevent terrorism.
> 
> [...]
> 
> The policies cover 'any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form,' including hard drives, flash drives, cell phones, iPods, pagers, beepers, and video and audio tapes. They also cover 'all papers and other written documentation,' including books, pamphlets and 'written materials commonly referred to as "pocket trash..."

It's not the policy that's amazing; it's the fact that the government has actually made it public.
