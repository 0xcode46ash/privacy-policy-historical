# Hitsquad Privacy Policy

**Hitsquad values Your privacy.**

**Personal Information**  
Hitsquad collects personal information about our users during registration for paid services and some free services, from our use of "cookie" technology as you use the service and sometimes during entry into a Hitsquad contest or sweepstakes. 

Hitsquad uses reasonable precautions to keep any personal information disclosed to us secure and we never disclose such information to third parties without your express permission. We only ever use personal information for the exact purpose we stated when you gave it to us. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. Hitsquad also links to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. 

**Aggregated Information**  
We also collect aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Hitsquad derives its revenue mainly from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. 

**Engage**  
The sites, GuitarSite.com and Shareware Music Machine, use the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy>
