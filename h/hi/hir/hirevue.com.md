# HireVue Privacy Policy - Hirevue

HireVue is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your candidates and employees. It is a HireVue policy that company and personal information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail, and evaluation results remain private and confidential. We do not sell or rent your company or personal information to others. We use customer information only for the purposes of setting up your account, delivering our service, enhancing the operation of our site, and administering our systems. We may use third parties in some instances to offer technical support. In such cases, we only give them access to the information needed to do their job, and we require that they abide by the HireVue privacy policy.

###  Personal Information

Our business customers request their job candidates complete a HireVue Interview which can include information such as work history, measurements of knowledge, skills, abilities, work style and other responses to questions. Only the customer, authorized employees of HireVue, Inc. and authorized designees of the customer have access to this information.

HireVue believes in protecting your privacy.
