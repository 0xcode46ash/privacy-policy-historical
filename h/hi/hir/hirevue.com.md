HireVue is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your candidates and employees. It is a HireVue policy that company and personal information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail, and evaluation results is private and confidential. We do not sell or rent your company or personal information to others. We use customer information only for the purposes of setting up your account, delivering our service, enhancing the operation of our site, and administering our systems. We may use third parties in some instances to offer technical support. In such cases, we only give them access to the information needed to do their job, and we require that they abide by HireVue's privacy policies.

Our business customers request their job candidates to complete a HireVue Interview which can include information such as work history, measurements of knowledge, skills, abilities, work style and other responses to questions. Only the customer, authorized employees of HireVue, Inc and authorized designees of the customer have access to this information. 

When you visit our website, we may collect usage information, such as the URL you came from, your IP address and domain type (e.g. .com or .org, etc.), your browser type and speed, the country, state and telephone area code where your server is located, and the pages of our site that were viewed during a visit. This information is used for internal purposes only and helps us to continually improve our website and service delivery. 

We have built our entire technology system so that neither customers nor employees can access company or applicant information without an appropriate password. In addition, we employ SSL data encryption when data is transmitted over the Internet, and have installed robust firewalls to prevent external "hacking" into our system. In addition, we host our servers externally at a leading third-party facility for added security and reliability.
