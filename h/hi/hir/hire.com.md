**Information We Gather**

For example, candidates may voluntarily choose to attach a resume to their profile, or opt to receive notifications about future job openings from Authoria.

Disclosure of this information is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 

**Service Providers**  
We use other third parties such as Verisign to provide credit card processing on our Site. When you sign up for a purchase on our Site, we will share your credit card information as necessary for such third party to provide that service.  These companies are not authorized to retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**Log Files and Aggregate Information**   
When users browse our Site, we may log the IP address and other typical tracking information, but the users identity remains anonymous. This information is aggregated into our log files as site-wide information and is used for system administration and auditing purposes. We may also use the IP addresses to gather statistical information for marketing purposes. Such information is not used to identify individuals or to reveal personal information. 

**Cookies  
**Cookies are bits of information sent by web sites to your browser that enable web sites to recognize your browser on future visits. Authoria uses temporary cookies to provide your browser with information tailored to your needs.

In addition, Authoria uses a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate for web metric purposes only. 

**Security**  
While Authoria tries to prevent third party access to personally identifiable information, the user acknowledges that internet communications are not always secure. In view of the foregoing, Authoria cannot warrant that the users personally identifiable information will not be access by unauthorized third parties, and user agrees that Authoria can not be liable for such disclosure. In addition, the user is responsible for preventing unauthorized access to the users own passwords and computer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Authoria uses industry standard encryption technology, such as digital IDs to protect its web servers, and secure communication to prevent data theft. All of our data is behind a firewall. Sensitive information, such as information transmitted via the Customer Connection, is encrypted prior to transmission through SSL and hashed for storage. We periodically review and improve our security policies as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. 

Authoria may host all or a portion of its servers at an Internet Data Center (IDC). The IDC is able to deliver the highest levels of reliability through a number of redundant subsystems, such as multiple fiber trunks coming into the IDC from multiple sources, fully redundant power on the premises, and multiple backup generators. 

**Information Sharing**   
Authoria may use personally identifiable information that you provide for marketing statistical and job seeking purposes. However, Authoria never willfully discloses any individually identifiable information about its users to third parties without permission to do so, except as required by law or to protect the rights, property or safety of Authoria, our users, or others.  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web Site. We do not sell users names or email addresses to other companies so that they can send unsolicited email or written promotional materials. We may employ outside service providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, or provide customer service, for example, when registering for the Authoria Users Conference.  The purpose of such companies’ or individuals’ use of such information is limited to performing their function for Authoria and not for any other purpose.  The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the Authoria border will surround the pages served by the service provider. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed pages is provided directly to those service providers for processing; however, Authoria maintains ownership and control of the submitted information. The service provider is prohibited from using the information for any secondary purposes.  Authoria’s privacy statement governs the collection and use of all personal information submitted on these registration pages.

**Opt-out Options/Correcting Your Personally Identifiable Information**  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our user information page or by emailing [support@authoria.com](mailto:support@authoria.com) or [unsubscribe@authoria.com](mailto:unsubscribe@authoria.com), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will respond to your request within 10-20 business days.
