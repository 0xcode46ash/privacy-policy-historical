Information Collection

** Hire.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information you have shared. It is our intent to use this information to help further your experience in a robust environment in which your confidentiality is of the utmost importance.

**Usage Tracking**

Generally available information about your machine capabilities are used to allow your experience to be a rewarding one. This includes the use of a user's domain name, browser type, MIME capabilities, and IP address provided by every user's browser. Hire.com tracks user traffic patterns via the Web server but does not associate this information with an individual user. This says that a user session may be tailored or tracked by browser or origin, but the user will be confidential.

**Cookies**

In addition to information provided by your browser, small data files called cookies can be created to help tailor your site visit. If you choose to accept the cookie, the information is stored on your hard disk for later retrieval by us the next time you visit. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to identify the individual user. This data includes only the information that you volunteer to provide us; email address, name, address, phone number, company information, and site preferences. On your return visit to our site, if you have elected to accept the cookie, we can streamline your login to the site and provide you with the relevant updates for information you have chosen to be informed about. By default, the cookies are set for one week.

If you choose to not take advantage of the cookie, acceptance of cookies can be turned off via your browser. You do not need cookies turned on to navigate through our site. Session information is only gathered while you are browsing our site. No information will be stored in a cookie on your machine if you choose not to accept cookies.

**Demonstration Registration**

You can choose to request an on-line demo of our product offering from Hire.com. Information collected will help our team to evaluate the level of demonstration you require and evaluate materials of preparation. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes. **

Partnering Registration

**

If you are a company that wishes to take advantage of our Partner program, we request that you fill out our Partnering registration form. Information collected will help our team to evaluate the level of partnership you requested and evaluate where the best opportunities exist. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes concerning the partnership program. No information gathered outside of this form will be used for evaluating the partnership application.

General users note: No data collected from the Hire.com site will be passed to our Partners. Listed Partners are referrals based on the relationships that Hire.com has established. These relationships enable companies to take advantage of our total solution service offering.

  **Career Section Optional Registration**

Information that you share with us is used primarily to make your career choices easier to match with opportunities available at our site. This includes information such as desired locations, job experience, salary expectations, areas of certification, or other general desires. Occasionally we will want to inform you of other note worthy facts about us, for which you will be asked to provide an email address for correspondence. Once you have found a job that meets your expectations, we will ask for you to complete a questionnaire and provide your name, address, phone number, and a resume statement.

One of the unique features of our site is that you have two choices of accessing the system:

1\. Anonymous Queries:

> At any time, you can choose to anonymously query the information posted on the site. For a more detailed search for jobs, you can choose to register on the site as an Anonymous user. Our site's registration form requires users to give us a contact identifier (like an email address), that will be used to access the system. You then have the choice to selectively receive notifications of matching jobs and other related correspondence about our company. We do not gather additional personal information without your active permission and participation.
> 
> _NOTE_ : A search engine behind the scenes will match your provided information with the jobs listed on the site. By default an Anonymous registration is not searchable by an individual at the company. Only when you choose to become Searchable will the system allow your information to be visible to a hiring manager or recruiter in the system. Only selected individuals (HR Personnel, hiring managers or recruiters of the company, or our support staff) have the authority to access the information you provide.

2\. Personal Login Account:

> At any time, you can convert an Anonymous registration to a Personal login account. We use demographic and profile data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. Unique identifiers (like your name), financial information (like a preferred salary range), and demographic information (like a zip code or job experience level) are optionally requested to help refine your Job Search. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
> 
> At this point you can opt to form a relationship with us such that we can manually search our database for jobs matching your preferences. Unlike job search and resume storage systems in the past, your information resides in our company database and is not available to a third party or anyone outside of our company. You can rest assured that we acknowledge your interest in our company and want to maintain a lasting relationship with you in the event a perfect job match arises.

While Hire.com has taken steps to protect your privacy, this site contains links to other sites. **H** **ire.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Job Submission Process**

Once a job match has been identified and you have chosen to return to the system and pursue an application, the system will prompt you through a series of questions. At this time, while it is possible to remain anonymous and not submit a resume at this time, it would be beneficial for you to provide personal contact information (such as your name, phone number or email address) that will allow us to get in touch with you. There is a possibility that you will be asked to fill in a questionnaire for the position. Your contact information and any resume, along with the answers to the questionnaire will be forwarded to the hiring authority. Your profile preferences are not shared with the hiring authority.

  **"Refer A Friend" service**

You can choose to electronically forward a job description to someone else by clicking on the "Refer a Friend" link at the bottom of the job. The user must provide the recipient's email address for which to send the job. This information is used only in the case of transmitting the job information and letting the recipient know who sent the job description. A brief text message provided by the sender is included with the job referral. This information is not used for any other purpose. **

Security

**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. During the career section registration process, you have the option to provide a password for your account. General hiring managers use authentication methods to access general searchable data about registrants. Access to the information obtained via registration forms on our site is monitored according to CERT advisories and CERT-recommended pro-active steps are taken to insure the system security. Additional security requirements take advantage of SSL capabilities. **

Choice/Opt-Out

**

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. Users may change this information any time and as often as necessary. You may set your career profile to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service by deselecting the Notification and Correspondence boxes respectively. For registration via our online comments or demonstration requests, please email us for removal from the list. **

Correct/Update

**

This site gives you the ability to update your site registration and modify your profile and any submitted resume at any time. To remove your information completely from our system, please send email <click here: service@hire.com> and request removal.

**Contacting the Web Site**
