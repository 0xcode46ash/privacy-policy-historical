# HireRight :: About Us :: Privacy / Security

|   
HireRight is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your applicants and employees. It is a HireRight policy that company and personal information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail, and search results is private and confidential. We do not sell or rent your company or personal information to others. We use customer information only for the purposes of setting up your profile, delivering our service, enhancing the operation of our site, and administering our systems. We may use third parties to assist in delivering our service, to serve site content, or to help administer customer emails. In such cases, we only give them access to the information needed to do their job, and we require that they abide by HireRight’s privacy policies. 

When you visit our website, we may collect usage information, such as the URL you came from, your IP address and domain type (e.g. .com or .org, etc.), your browser type, the country, state and telephone area code where your server is located, the pages of our site that were viewed during a visit, and any search terms that you entered on our site. This information is used for internal purposes only and helps us to continually improve our website and service delivery. 

We have built our entire technology system so that neither customers nor employees can access company or applicant information without an appropriate password. In addition, we employ SSL data encryption when data is transmitted over the Internet, and have installed robust firewalls to prevent external “hacking” into our system. We also periodically commission external security experts to attempt to gain unwarranted access to our system, to continually ensure that no security breaches exist. In addition, we host our servers externally at a leading third-party facility for added security and reliability. 

Our emphasis on privacy and security is equally reflected in the way we work. All employees of HireRight receive a thorough background check. In addition, security training is part of every new employee orientation. We maintain only paper shredders, rather than trash cans, in all production areas and shred all of our trash nightly. Additionally, we have invested in state-of-the-art security equipment in our facilities, and actively monitor and control the entrance of anyone to our premises. 

If you have any questions regarding our security and privacy, please [contact us](mailto:support@hireright.com).
