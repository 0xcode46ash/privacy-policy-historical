Privacy Policy

Talent Technology Corporation ("TTC") respects your privacy when you take advantage of all the Internet offers and TTC's products and services. We're committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful, safe, online experience that you can get anywhere. 

**TTC operates on the following privacy principles:**

  * We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally, this information is requested when you register for a particular service, ask for more information, or when applying to become a partner.   

  * TTC collects and uses your Personal Information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences. We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from TTC and its affiliates. Personal Information collected on TTC sites and services may be stored and processed in Canada, the United States or any other country in which TTC or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.   

  * From time to time, TTC may also gather anonymous information to be used or shared with third parties. This information does not personally identify you but may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies", "IP addresses", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.   

  * TTC may provide links to outside resources in an effort to help you gather more business information. We are not responsible for the content provided on these sites, their privacy policies, or how they treat information about their users. The reliability, availability, legality, performance and other aspects of resources on Internet sites other than www.talenttech.com is beyond our control, and we make no representations or warranties with respect to such sites.   

  * Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information outside of TTC and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some TTC sites or services may allow you to choose to share your Personal Information with select TTC partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. Some TTC services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both TTC and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. 
  * TTC may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of TTC, our site or other TTC users, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of other stakeholders and public users.



**Changes to This Privacy Statement**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Privacy Statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of how TTC is protecting your information. 

If at any time you believe that TTC has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail to [privacy@talenttech.com](mailto:privacy@talenttech.com) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
