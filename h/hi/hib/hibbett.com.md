                            HIBBETT PRIVACY POLICY
Our Commitment to Privacy
Your privacy is important to us at Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc. (“Hibbett”). To better
protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices
and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To
make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point
where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect & How We Use It
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we never use or share the personally
identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ways described
below without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such
unrelated uses. However, we will fully cooperate should a situation arise where we are
required by law or requested by a law enforcement agency to provide information about
a customer.
 General Website Usage
When you visit our Web Site, Hibbett collects navigational information during each
visitor's use of our Web site. This may include viewing a video, online catalog or email
promotion or voting in a survey. In the process of gathering navigational information,
non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service
provider and IP address) may be collected. The navigational information tells Hibbett
about the use of our Web site by visitors, including the areas of our site that are most
visited or the time of a last visit to a page on our site. It also tells us about the technical
efficiencies of our Web site and services (i.e. the time it takes a visitor to connect to our
Web site or download pages). The navigational information helps us better understand
a visitor's experience at Hibbett and improve upon that experience by recognizing and
delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer.
 Submitting a Form
When you submit a form on our Web site to send us a comment, make a nomination for
one of our community programs, apply for a job or locate your nearest Hibbett store, you
provide information about yourself and, in the case of nomination to one of our
community programs, about a third party. Further, in applying for a job via the online
application form, you are providing personally-identifiable information about yourself.
These forms are sent electronically to Hibbett and disbursed to the applicable internal
departments only. The applicable department will use the information provided for the
specific purpose for which it was submitted only.
 Sending an Email
When you choose to send an email to any of the Hibbett email addresses provided on
our Web site, for example to send your resume for a job opening or contact one of our
Real Estate Managers, you are sending your email address. In such case, your emails
are stored so that we may properly address your questions and concerns and your email
address will only be used to answer the email received.
 Utilizing Special Programs
When you register for any of our programs, such as Hibbett Sports MVP Rewards,
Hibbett Sports Team Manager or Hibbett Sports Gift List, you are providing information


about yourself. This information may include Name, Age, Sex, Date of Birth, Street
Address, Email Address and Phone Number. This information may be used to develop,
market and sell products and services to you and to tailor your experience on our Web
site to your interests; to send our Hibbett Sports MVP Rewards participants updates
about the Hibbett Sports MVP program, their rewards, and our products, promotions and
events; and to deliver information through the various communication channels you have
provided to us about our products or Web site, including adding you to a Hibbett e-mail
list or to our customer mail marketing list when you register for an account or sign up for
Hibbett Sports MVP Rewards.
 Cookies
We use “cookies” to allow us to identify participants in our various programs or account
holders in order to optimize their experience on our Web site. “Cookies” are files stored
on your computer’s hard drive by your browser; they do not contain data that will identify
you personally.
We Don’t Share Information With Third Parties
We do not share any information we collect from you with third parties. However, we
may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on your behalf. These
companies may employ “cookies” and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness.
Any information these third parties collect via “cookies” and action tags is completely
anonymous.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we
never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are
under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access the information you provided to register for our various programs by
logging into your account and accessing ‘My Account’. To protect your privacy and
security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access
or making corrections.
