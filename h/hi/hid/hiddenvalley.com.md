Clorox Privacy Policy For United States Consumers  
Our Privacy Policy for Canadian sites may be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061224011214id_/http%3A//www.clorox.com/cdn_privacy.php).

**Last Revised: April 5, 2005**

The Clorox Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Clorox”) are committed to the protection and appropriate use of the information you submit to us online. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use and safeguard personal information obtained from individual consumers in the United States through this website (the “Site”).

What Information Do We Collect?  
Information Clorox collects from visitors to this Site includes personal information such as names, postal addresses and email addresses, and other information such as survey responses. When making an online purchase, you may be asked to provide relevant credit card information.  
Personal information is collected only for specific purposes and with the knowledge of the person providing the information. To access the Site you are not required to register or submit any personal information.   
The content of this Site is not directed to children and Clorox does not knowingly collect personal information from persons under eighteen years of age.

Special Notification for California Consumers  
Effective January 1, 2005, individual consumers who reside in California and have provided their personal information to a Clorox entity may request information about that entity’s disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests should identify the name of the Clorox entity and must be submitted to Clorox at [privacy@clorox.com](mailto:privacy@clorox.com), or at the following mailing address: 

> > The Clorox Company,   
>  Mail Stop 2334,   
>  1221 Broadway,   
>  Oakland, California 94612-1888. 

Within thirty days of receiving such a request, Clorox will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by that Clorox entity to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This type of request may be made no more than once per calendar year with regard to a particular Clorox entity. Clorox reserves its right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the email or physical addresses specified in this paragraph.  
.

Why Do We Collect This Information?  
Purposes for which Clorox may collect personal information online include, but are not limited to: 

> **Sweepstakes and Contest Entries.**  
>  From time to time, Clorox offers sweepstakes, contests and other promotions that require online registration. Persons wishing to participate in those programs are asked to provide some personal information. Some of the information requested for this purpose is optional, but other requested information, such as the individual’s name and email address, is mandatory because it will be needed to identify and notify winners. Also, some contests may require selection of a user ID and password by the individual. 
> 
> **Coupon and Rebate Requests.**  
>  Visitors to the Site may be offered the opportunity to apply for rebates or request discount coupons associated with Clorox products. Those visitors may be asked to provide certain personal information such as names, postal addresses and email addresses in connection with those offers. 
> 
> **"Contact Us" and "Write to Us" Features.**  
>  Clorox encourages visitors to the Site to contact us with questions and requests. Clorox also offers email news updates for visitors who expressly request that service. Personal information of persons using these features may be collected in order to facilitate our responses to those inquiries. 
> 
> **Product Registration.**  
>  Purchasers of certain Clorox products may want to register their purchases online so that they can take advantage of warranties, product updates and other benefits. Purchasers are asked to submit certain personal information such as names, postal addresses and email addresses as part of the product registration process. 
> 
> **Loyalty Program Registration.**  
>  Clorox offers various “loyalty” programs that provide benefits to purchasers of Clorox products. The loyalty program online registration process requests personal information concerning the individual who signs up. Participants in loyalty programs also may need to provide personal information in order to redeem program benefits. 
> 
> **Requests for Consumer Brochures and Videos.**  
>  Clorox may offer product information, including brochures and videos, through the Site. Persons ordering those materials are asked to provide their name and postal address. 

Purposes for which Clorox may collect other information include: 

> **Consumer Surveys.**  
>  Clorox sometimes conducts online consumer surveys or asks for information from persons completing online forms. This information, such as household size, past purchases and household income, is provided voluntarily and is never required for participation in a sweepstakes, contest or loyalty program, to register a product or to obtain product information. 
> 
> **"Clickstream" Data.**  
>  The Site automatically collects certain data concerning its interactions with visitors that facilitate Site operation, management and planning. Such data may include the IP address of your computer, the date and time of an online request, the type of browser and operating system used by your computer, the time required to download information you requested, and error codes generated while your browser is in contact with the Site. 

How Do We Use, and When Do We Disclose, the Information We Collect?  
Personal information provided by consumers and visitors to our Site is used to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through the Site. For example, Clorox sometimes shares information submitted in connection with sweepstakes, contests, loyalty programs and other programs with vendors that Clorox has retained to administer those and other programs. Clorox may also share certain information with third party organizations for the purpose of processing your credit card transactions. Clorox seeks to restrict third parties’ use of such data to the purposes for which it has been provided and to ensure the third parties do not disclose that information to unauthorized parties. 

Clorox does not sell personal information collected on its Site. Clorox may from time to time share your personal information with our affiliates, or with business and promotional partners that offer products or services that we believe will be of interest to you. Clorox also may share other data, collected in connection with consumer surveys and other activities, with consumer research and marketing firms. Clorox will provide personal information to law enforcement authorities and other entities where Clorox determines that such disclosure is required by subpoena, warrant, court order or other applicable law or process. 

Although Clorox seeks to require companies with which it does business, and to which personal information is provided, to protect such personal information, Clorox cannot be responsible for third parties’ violations of this Policy or of any other rights of visitors or consumers that use this Site. 

Clorox may provide personal information and other information, collected online from visitors and consumers, to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of Clorox, a subsidiary or affiliate or line of business associated with Clorox, or substantially all of the assets of Clorox or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business.

Cookies  
Cookies are small text files, placed on the hard drive of a visitor’s computer, that facilitate the operation of the Site and visitors’ use of the Site. As is standard practice on many corporate websites, the Site uses cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to help us understand which websites our visitors are coming from and what websites they go to when they leave our Site, which parts of the Site are the most popular, and how much time they spend on our Site. We also use cookies and other technologies to facilitate participation in our loyalty programs, as well as to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. 

Also, where specific programs associated with this Site require a user ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID and password so that you will not have to reenter that information the next time you access the Site. This function is accomplished by placement of a cookie. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so click the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use those services on the Site that require you to sign in. 

Some uses of cookies in connection with the Site may be under the control of third-party entities that Clorox retains for the management of certain programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/consumer requests. Clorox requests these entities to confine their use of cookies and similar technologies, but Clorox cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies.

Security  
Clorox takes measures designed to prevent unauthorized intrusion to the Site and the alteration, acquisition or misuse of personal information. Clorox cautions consumers and visitors to this Site, however, that no network is entirely secure. Accordingly, Clorox cannot be responsible for loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition of personal information furnished to this Site, or for any damages resulting from such loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition.

Offline v. Online Practices  
This Policy applies solely to Clorox’s online information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline, with the following exception. Clorox may merge information collected about you through offline means with information that is stored in our databases along with information gathered online. Any such merged information, however, will not be disclosed to others except as permitted by this Policy.

Changes to Privacy Policy  
We encourage you to read this Policy before using the Site, and not to use the Site if you disagree with any part of this Policy. Your use of the Site signifies your agreement to all terms of this Policy. 

Please note that Clorox may revise this Policy from time to time. You should bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version of this Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by checking the “Last Revised” legend at the top of the Policy. 

This Policy is the sole authorized statement of Clorox’s practices concerning the collection, use and protection of personal information through this Site. Any summaries of this Policy generated by third party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the “Platform for Privacy Preferences” or “P3P”) shall have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon Clorox, and neither supersede nor modify this Policy  
.
