We abide by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements. Our web site is not intended for children under the age of 13 typically, and we will not knowingly collect data from them.

Choice ** **

HairlossTalk will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S. 

Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. For example, as part of HairlossTalk's commitment to offering you choice, we may enable you to make online purchases directly from us or through our resellers. When you choose our resellers, we will inform you that your registration and shopping basket data is being transferred to the reseller you selected. This notice is important because when you choose to make online purchases through our resellers, use of your registration and shopping basket data by the reseller is then governed by their privacy policy. Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S.
