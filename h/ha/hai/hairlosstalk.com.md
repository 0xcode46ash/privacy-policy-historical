_Last updated:   June 25, 2001_

This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers the six foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Collection, Use, Sharing, Children, and Security. 

Awareness

HairlossTalk provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of every page on the site, with exception of the Discussion Forums.

What we collect

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you fill out a form to request more information on a product, register a profile in our Discussion Forums, registering for our Monthly Newsletter, or establishing an account with us in our Online Product Center. Personal information collected by HairlossTalk.com often is limited to e-mail address, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

For example: If you choose to make a purchase in the Online Product Center, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information. 

How we use it

All information collected is used solely for the purpose announced on the page where the form resides, and to support your relationship with HairlossTalk.com.  We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.  

HairlossTalk.com will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on HairlossTalk.com web site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of HairlossTalk.com and its family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of HairlossTalk.com, its affiliate Web sites, or the public. 

There are only three locations where we collect information from you, and all are done with your knowledge and consent:

  * The [ Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205120648id_/http%3A//www.hairlosstalk.com/contact.htm) Form - Information entered here is used solely to communicate back with you, and qualify you for our Monthly newsletter which is emailed with a special opt-out option in the event you do not wish to continue receiving them.
  * [Discussion Forum](http://www.hairlosstalk.com/discus/) \- Assuming you choose to register a Username and Profile.
  * Forms - There are various forms throughout the site.  Some appear in newsletters, some on product information pages.  These forms are used typically for you to request more information on a topic, or register for a study or event.  Your information is used only to complete the goal of the form, whether it be sending you the information, or enrolling you in a study.
  * Email - There are locations throughout the site where you are able to email us to request more information on a product.  In these cases, we have established an agreement with the product vendor that your email will not be resold to any third party, and that you will only receive the information you have requested.
  * [Newsletter Registration Forms](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205120648id_/http%3A//www.hairlosstalk.com/new.htm) \- Boxes appear throughout the site allowing you to register for our Monthly Newsletter.  Information entered here is Email address only, and is used to register the user for our Monthly Newsletter and upcoming chat announcements.  This information is kept 100% strictly confidential.  No 2nd or Third party will ever receive our newsletter mailing list from us, and you will receive an email only once per month.
  * [Online Product Center](https://id64.securedata.net/hairlosstalk/catalog/default.php) \- Information collected here is very personal, including name, address, phone, email, and credit card billing information.  All of this information is collected on a secure server for your protection, and is only used to communicate your interest in the products to the product vendors themselves.
