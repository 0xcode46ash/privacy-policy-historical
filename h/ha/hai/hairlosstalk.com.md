First and foremost, it is important that you know that HairlossTalk has never, and will never give your email information to *any* third party whatsoever when filling out forms, joining our EMail notification lists, or any other similar communication. There are no exceptions to this. We are extremely adimant about this issue, and your privacy and security will always be 100% protected. 

At the time of the writing of this legally binding document, HLT provides personal information only to our shippers who use it to ship products to those who order on our store. They are prohibited from redistributing that information to anyone.

This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers the six foundation principles of fair information: Awareness, Collection, Use, Sharing, Children, and Security.

  
HairlossTalk provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

All information collected is used solely for the purpose announced on the page where the form resides, and to support your relationship with HairlossTalk.com. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
