      2. to provide you with information about us (including other products and services we offer) and to send you newsletters; 
      3. to notify you about changes to our service; 
      4. to help us communicate with you effectively should you try to contact us via the site, including verification of any claims you may make; and 
      5. to ensure that content from the site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or device.

We may use your personal data to send you emails (or other communications) with details of our or third party products or services which may be of interest to you, including information about special offers or promotions.

  7. ## How do we protect personal data?

    1. Security is a high priority. We take appropriate precautions to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure, alteration or destruction using the same safeguards as we use for our own proprietary information. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers and any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 
    2. Unfortunately, email and other electronic communications are not secure if they have not been encrypted and your communications may pass through servers in a number of different countries before they reach us. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data (and will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access once we have received it), we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the site and any transmission is at your own risk. We also cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access to, or loss of, personal data that results from a cause beyond our control, nor can we be held responsible for the actions or omissions of other users or third parties who may misuse your personal data which they collect from the site. 
  8. ## To whom do we disclose your information?

    1. We may share your information with any member of our group (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries from time to time, in each case as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006). 
    2. Payment details, including credit card numbers, are supplied direct to our banking partner mentioned on the site. We do not receive such information. However, to ensure your details are not being used without consent, your personal data may be supplied to relevant third parties, including credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, who may keep a record of that information. 
    3. We may share your information with selected third parties, including: 
      1. business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you; 
      2. analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of the site; and 
      3. e-commerce platform providers, website hosts and businesses which assist us in undertaking communications or monitoring the site. 
    4. **Very important:** If, as a user of the site, you have booked a Service Provider to provide services to you, we will provide your contact details to the relevant Service Provider in order to enable them to attend at service visits and to contact you if necessary (for example, if the Service Provider is delayed). 
    5. **Very important:** We will include the Service Provider’s first name and photograph in their profile on the site, which will be available to and searchable by all users of the site. We will also pass the Service Provider’s full name and telephone number to any user of the site who has booked and paid a deposit for a Service Provider to provide services to them. 
    6. **Very important:** If you post a review/rating/comment on the site, your username will be shown. 
    7. Very important: If you post a review/rating/comment on the site, your username will be shown. 
      1. if we have reason to believe that you have breached our terms and conditions, that such steps are necessary to protect us or others or that a criminal act has been committed; 
      2. if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority; or 
      3. in the case of an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger or business combination involving all or the relevant part of our busine 
    8. Except as otherwise specifically included in this policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information that you give to us, that we collect from you or that we receive from third parties. If you disclose your information to third parties, whether they are other users of the site or other websites (including websites which link to or from the site), different rules and/or policies may apply to their use or disclosure of your information and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these rules and/or policies. Please therefore check them before submitting any personal data. 
  9. ## Where do we store your personal data

    1. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and we will of course comply with the applicable laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the EEA. 
  10. ## Can you ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes?

    1. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at [info@hassle.com](mailto:info@hassle.com). 
  11. ## How can you access your personal data?

    1. The Act gives you the right to access your personal data held by us. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. We may charge an administration fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. 
    2. For information about your rights under UK data protection laws, see the website of the [UK Information Commissioner](http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/). 
  12. ## Contact
