### Introduction

At Hastings Direct, we recognise our responsibility to treat the information we obtain about you and others with care. We are committed to protecting your privacy and will only use the information we collect lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We have provided this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect and use your personal information when you visit our website. The pages on this website are only directed at UK residents and we recommend you take a few minutes to read this section. You should also show the details on this page to any named driver or joint insured person on the policy. 

### Who we are

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 the Data Controller in relation to the personal data you supply is Hastings Insurance Services Limited. Whenever the name 'Hastings Direct' 'we' or 'us' is used within these pages, it refers to one or more of the trading styles of Hastings Insurance Services Limited. 

### Use of the information we collect

Hastings Direct collects information provided by you to enable us to: 

  * Provide you with an insurance quotation and administer any policies you purchase. 
  * Assist you with claims and enquiries. 
  * Maintain and improve our level of service. 
  * Carry out research, statistical analysis and for crime prevention. 
  * Tell you about other useful products and services. 
  * Offer renewal. 



We will pass your information to other organisations (e.g. insurers and services providers) to enable them to provide the cover/services you have requested. They in turn may pass your information to their agent(s) in order to deliver the service or carry out relevant investigations. 

Some of the personal data we collect may be sensitive, for instance information concerning motoring offences that may be recorded against you. By proceeding with a quotation, you signify your consent for the processing of this sensitive personal data. You also signify that you have been appointed to act for any other person whose information has been provided, and that you have their authority to consent to the processing of their personal data, including sensitive personal data. 

You have a right to ask for a copy of your information and to correct any inaccuracies. We may charge a small fee for any copies provided. 

We will disclose your information if we have been legitimately asked to provide it for legal or regulatory purposes or in connection with actual or prospective legal proceedings. Occasionally, insurers/organisations may transmit or store your data outside the European Economic Area (EAA) for the purposes listed above and for systems administration. Such countries may not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK. 

### Claims and fraud prevention

Insurers supply and share information through various databases, in order to prevent or detect fraud. These databases may be checked when you apply for insurance or make a claim. Under the conditions of your policy you must report any incident (such as an accident or theft), which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you report such an incident, the information relating to it will be passed to the database(s). 

### Motor insurance

If you take out a motor insurance policy through us, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC). MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purpose of establishing whether a driver’s use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. 

If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad) other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and the MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information, which is held in the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or www.miic.org.co.uk 

### Keeping you informed

Hastings Direct may use your information to contact you with details of other similar products, services and special offers by mail, electronic mail or telephone, unless you have chosen not to receive such communication. Your information may also be disclosed and used for these purposes after any policy you purchase through us has expired. We may occasionally share your information with our selected partners. If you prefer not to be contacted for any of these purposes and have not already told us, please write to us at Hastings Direct, Conquest House, Collington Avenue, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, TN39 3LW. Alternatively, please amend the tick box settings in the Data Protection section when you complete your quotation. 

### Renewal

Prior to the renewal date of your policy, we will provide you with details of the terms on which your policy may be renewed. For your protection your cover may automatically be renewed – if so, we will provide you with notice of this before your policy expires. If you receive such notification from us, but do not wish to renew your cover: 

  * If you pay your premium by direct debit, you must tell us prior to your renewal so that we can stop your direct debit deductions. 
  * If you pay your premium by debit/credit card, you must tell us prior to your renewal so that we can stop your card being debited. 



### Call monitoring and recording

Please be advised that your call may be recorded and/or monitored for our mutual protection and to ensure a consistent and high level of service.
