We may use and analyse your personal information for the following purposes:

  * In relation to our online quotation service, to provide you with one or more online quotations on behalf of one or more insurers.
  * In relation to our online cover service, to consider your application for, and facilitate your purchase of, an insurance policy through us.

  * Validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time, including upon application for insurance, in the event of an accident or a claim, or at a time of renewal).



Driving Licence Number

  * If you provide your driving licence number (DLN) this may be passed to the DVLA in order to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsements/conviction data. Undertaking searches using your DLN will help us check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. DLN searches may be carried out when we give you a quote, or before we renew your policy. A DLN search will not show a footprint on your (or any named driver's) driving licence record. For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit [www.dvla.gov.uk](http://www.dvla.gov.uk/).



Management information purposes ie to analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of:

  * Portfolio assessment
  * Risk assessment
  * Performance reporting
  * Management reporting.



Anti fraud purposes ie to detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by:

  * Sharing information about you with other organisations and public bodies including the police.
  * Tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies.
  * Undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register and where appropriate the Motor insurance anti-fraud and theft register administered by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDSL). This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.



Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities:

  * Claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim such as third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history.
  * Motor Insurance Database – Information relating to your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB). MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVLNI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including: 
    * Electronic Licensing
    * Continuous Insurance Enforcement
    * Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders).
    * The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.



If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.

Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at [www.askmid.com](http://www.askmid.com/);

  * Complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman.

  * To offer you the opportunity to renew a policy or purchase a replacement policy.
  * To update our records about you.

In order for us to respond to your request for certain of our online services, such as quotes, cover and claims handling, and to enable us to deal with you in respect of those services over the telephone, it may be necessary for us to ask you to provide us with sensitive information (such as details of medical conditions and criminal convictions) about you and/or others who may be party to one or more services provided by, and/or insurance policies purchased through, us. We will process any sensitive information you provide to us in accordance with this privacy policy and we will not use any sensitive personal information about you and/or others except for the specific purposes for which you provide it and to provide the services described in your insurance policy. We will process any sensitive information you provide to us about a third party on the basis that you have provided us with this information with the explicit consent of that third party, so please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about others having obtained their prior agreement to this.

By requesting that we provide you with online services, or contacting us over the telephone to request the provision of services in relation to a quotation or insurance policy, we will consider you to give consent to our collecting and processing (as outlined above) of any sensitive information about you and/or relevant others which you may be required to provide.

Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above.

Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to IDSL.

The finance option shown to you is arranged by Hastings Direct and is the cheapest available to you from us. An alternative credit option may be available for policies underwritten by Aviva. Please email us at [alternativecredit@hastingsdirect.com](mailto:alternativecredit@hastingsdirect.com) for further information.

The Register is run by the Association of British Insurers. When we deal with your request for an online quote or a policy, and/or when you report a claim to us, relating to motor insurance, we may search the register. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass on information in respect of that to the register.

Your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) which has been established by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC) to help identify uninsured drivers, and may be searched by the police to confirm the identities of those insured to drive a vehicle and/or for preventing and detecting crime. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purposes of Electronic Vehicle Licensing. It may be used by the MICC, insurers and the Motor Insurers' Bureau to help identify relevant policy information in the event of an accident. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information, which is held in the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or [www.mib.org.uk](http://www.mib.org.uk/ "www.mib.org.uk").
