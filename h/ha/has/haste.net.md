  1. _Cookies_. “Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use Cookies to help us improve the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your authentication status so you do not have to re­enter your credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your experience with the Services and for analytics and fraud prevention. You can instruct your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept Cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services.

  1. _Web Beacons_ : “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to monitor how many people are using the Services or opening our emails, and for what purpose.


  1. _Website Analytics_ : We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the Services, including, for example, to record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the Site. These website analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth herein.


  4. _Information Provided by or on Behalf of Children_. The Services are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age and children under age 13 are prohibited from using the Services. By accessing, using and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If we learn that we have received or inadvertently gathered any information from a child under age 13, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his/her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he/she cannot use the Services and we will subsequently use reasonable efforts to delete that information from our records.


  5. _Use of Information_. We use your information, including Personal Information, to provide the Services to you and to help improve them, including to contact you when necessary or requested and to prevent, detect and investigate security breaches and potentially illegal or prohibited activities. We may use information that is not Personal Information (including Personal Information that has been de­identified and/or aggregated) for marketing, advertising, or any other uses in our sole discretion.


  6. _Disclosure of Information_. We may disclose and/or transfer certain information that we collect from you (which may include Personal Information and/or Traffic Data) as follows: (a) to our business partners who perform core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage or security) related to our operation of the Services and/or by making certain features available to our users; (b) to our business partners who perform website analytics; (c) to another company in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of us (whether in whole or in part), in which case we will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email and will post a notice on the Site alerting you to the business transition prior to transferring your Personal Information and before your information becomes subject to materially different privacy and security policies and practices; and (d) if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2) protect our rights, property or safety or that of another party; (3) enforce other agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third party rights. We may disclose information that is not Personal Information (including Personal Information that has been de­identified and/or aggregated) to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses in our sole discretion. We may also provide your Personal Information (excluding billing information) to our third party marketing partners (“ ** _Direct Marketers_** ”) so that they can directly inform you about products or services which may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with such partners, you may opt-out of our doing so by following the steps outlined in “Your Sharing Options” below.


  7. _Public Information_. Any information that you post in chat rooms or message boards on the Site or reveal in a review of the Services to us or on the Site or on any other website is public information and may be shared or used by us for any reason in our sole discretion.


  8. _Storage and Security of Information_. While we strive to use generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, both during transmission and in storage, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted or required by law.


  9. _Controlling Your Personal Information_. If you are a registered user of the Services, you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile or change your username by logging in and accessing your account. If you wish to close your account, please email us at _info@haste.net_. We will delete your account and the information in your account as soon as reasonably possible. Please note, however, that we reserve the right to retain information from closed accounts, including to comply with law, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce any agreement between you and us, and take other actions permitted by law. You must promptly notify us if you become aware that any of your account data is lost, stolen or used without permission.


  10. _Your Sharing Options_. If you do not want to receive special offers, marketing communications, advertisements, newsletters or other promotional communications (“ ** _Marketing Communications_** “) from us or if you wish to prevent us from sharing your Personal Information with any Direct Marketers in the future, you may opt-out by sending an email to _info@haste.net_ with a request to cease some or all future Marketing Communications. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take up to ten (10) business days for such opt-out to become effective. If we have shared your Personal Information with any Direct Marketers prior to our receipt of your request, we may not have the ability to prevent such Direct Marketers from continuing to use and disclose your Personal Information, including for the purpose of sending Marketing Communications to you, and you will be required to contact such third parties directly to prevent their further use and disclosure of your Personal Information. Also note that if you opt-out of our Marketing Communications, we may still email or communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information or request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons.


  11. _Links to Other Websites_. The Services may contain links to third party websites. A link to a third party website does not mean that we endorse that website, the quality or accuracy of information presented on the website, or the persons or entities associated with the website. If you decide to visit a third party website, you are subject to the privacy policy of the third party website, as applicable, and we are not responsible for the policies and practices of the third party website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or digital service that you may be able to access through the Services, which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may materially differ from this Privacy Policy.


  12. _Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy_. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage. We will notify you of any material change by posting notice on this webpage. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.
