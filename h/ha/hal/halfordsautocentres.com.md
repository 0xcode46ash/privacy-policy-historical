**Your consent**  
Your use of this website signifies your consent to us collecting and using personal data about you as specified below in accordance with this policy statement. Should we choose to change these terms for any reason, the changes will be posted here so that you are always kept informed about the collection and use of your personal information, and when we disclose it.

**How do we collect personal information about you and how is it used?** You may provide personal information when communicating with us.

 You may use our services and give your name and e-mail address to make a comment about our services or Web site.

If you enter a competition or promotion we will ask your name, address and e-mail address.

We will collect information about your tastes and preferences, both when you tell us and by analysis of customer traffic, including using "cookies".

It may be that some of the personal information you give us (for example, about your health and age) is sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998. Such information ("sensitive information") will only be disclosed with your express consent.

It may be that you provide us details of credit or debit cards or bank accounts in making payment to us. Any such information (confidential financial information) will be disclosed only in accordance with the disclosure policy below.

We may use personal information collected about you to help us develop the layout of our website to ensure that our site is as useful and enjoyable as possible.

We may use personal information collected about you to let you know about functions on our Web site or changes to our terms and conditions of use. 

**The way we use information**  
The information we collect is used for the following purposes;

To be able to communicate, by means of electronic mail or otherwise, with you in connection with subscription, competitions, and other interactive offers. 

We will use the information for the provision of products, services, administration, marketing and analysing your transactions. We may need to disclose your information to our agents or other service providers for these purposes. We may share your information with our other group companies and with third parties with whom we have a business relationship.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. For example, we are able to understand that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Which Information must you provide?**  
On every occasion you are requested to provide personal information, it will be clear when the information is required for a service and when it is purely voluntary to provide it.

**Disclosure policy**  
We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to enable us to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests to operate its systems and to protect itself or its users.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How do we protect your information?**  
We have strict security procedures covering the storage of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access and to comply with the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. This means that sometimes we may ask you for proof of identity or for other personal information before we can process your call or enquiry further.

**Cookies**  
We may use "cookies" for administrative purposes such as cataloging traffic patterns throughout the site and can use a "cookie" to assign a "User ID" for this purpose. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. If you have a user ID this will automatically identify your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know who you are, even if we do assign a cookie to your computer.

Other companies that advertise on our site may also have the ability to assign a different cookie to you in a process that we do not control. However, since cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals, these advertisers will never know who you are - and we will not reveal that information to them.

**How To Contact Us**  
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 0800 037 0800 or send us an email.

If you no longer wish to receive information or advertisements from us please contact us by email. An email address to which you can make such a request is located at the end of information sent to you.
