## Chemical Regulations

Halfords supplies many chemical-based products online, via our catalogue and in-store. All retailers selling chemical products are obliged to comply with European directives by providing key health and safety information for this type of product. Several key European Directives/Regulations exist governing the supply of chemical products with regard to labelling, packaging and marketing and these regulations also require health and safety documentation to be made readily available.

The Regulations themselves are designed to protect both the environment and human health, and as a responsible supplier Halfords naturally takes its obligations very seriously and ensures it complies and enforces these regulations.

[Halfords Health and Safety information](http://www.my-sds.co.uk/default.asp?accountid=guest&languagecode=44&companyid=halfords) for chemical products provides access to the latest up-to-date label information, Safety Data Sheets and Detergent Ingredient Data sheets.

To access further information, follow the link above, then select ’Name’ for the search criteria in the left-hand drop-down box, and in the box underneath, enter either the full name of your product if know, e.g. Halfords 5W30 VW Fully Synthetic Oil, or a generic name, e.g. oil, click ’Search’, and all the products we have information on will be displayed in the box to the right. Then simply click on the rectangular symbol to display the safety data sheet, or the diamond symbol to display the chemical supply symbol. 

Should you have any queries regarding this or any other safety issues please contact our [customer services](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CSCategoryDisplay?storeId=11101&langId=-1&catalogId=21253&categoryId=292555&topCategoryId=292543) department
