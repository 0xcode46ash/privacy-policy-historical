Halfords is registered under the Data Protection Act. We are committed to protecting your privacy and have taken steps to explain this in full below.

**1**. **About Halfords: where your information goes - and where it does not go.

****a.** To enable us to provide you with marketing and customer services: If you have requested extra services such as ordering a catalogue we ask for your contact details, such as your e-mail or your home address. We can then tell you about new products and services that we think will be of interest to you, or to sort out any queries you may have about using the sites. We aim to keep our contact with you to an acceptable level. You will only ever receive information from Halfords unless you have given us your permission to pass on your details to external third parties.

You have a right not to receive this information - see more information in point 3 below.
