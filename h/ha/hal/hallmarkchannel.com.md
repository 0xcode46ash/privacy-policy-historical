Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Hallmark Channel web site. Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide you with this notice outlining how we collect and use online information. 

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**   
Hallmark Channel collects personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, cable/satellite provider, birth date, gender), when it is voluntarily submitted by users in connection with newsletters, sweepstakes, contests, feedback, registrations, surveys, memberships, products or services.   
We collect aggregate information about your activities on our web site (such as the pages at the site which you access most frequently, what browser version you are using, what browser plug-ins you have installed, etc.) This allows us to improve our site based on current technology demographics so that we may provide you with the best online experience at Hallmark Channel websites. The ONLY time we ever receive personal information from you is when you volunteer the information. The personal information we receive from a user-submitted entry for a specific sweepstakes, contest, registration, survey, product or service may be shared with that sweepstakes, contest, registration, survey, product or service's third-party promotional partners if the user has given Hallmark Channel permission to do so. Hallmark Channel will always request permission to share such information with such promotional partners. Users may elect not to participate by clicking the appropriate on-screen checkbox before submitting any information. Hallmark Channel E-mail Newsletter subscribers can easily unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located at the bottom of every one of our e-mail newsletters. Additionally, Hallmark Channel members may also unsubscribe by modifying their “Edit My Profile” link on the Hallmark Channel website after logging in. **COOKIES
