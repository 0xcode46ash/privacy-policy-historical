Information We Collect and How It's Used

Aggregate Information  
We collect aggregate information on visits made to our pages. When you visit our website, our web server recognizes only your domain name, but not your e-mail address. This means that we can track visits to our site, while visitors remain anonymous. Non-personal information is collected, such as how many consumers visit the site, what pages are accessed and which browsers or operating systems are used. We also track which websites refer visitors to the Hal Leonard site. This information helps us improve the content of our site. 

Cookies  
Cookies are pieces of data your web browser stores on your hard drive. We use cookies to create your shopping list. Cookies allow you to make a list of products that interest you, and retrieve it again on subsequent visits to the site.

From time to time we may share our mailing lists with reputable third parties who may also send you information about their products or services that may be of interest to you. You can, however, have your name put on our "do-not-share" list by sending an e-mail to us. Please provide us with your exact name, postal address and e-mail address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.
