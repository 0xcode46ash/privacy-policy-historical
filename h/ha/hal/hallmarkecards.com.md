Effective Date: 9/23/02

**What information does Hallmark collect and why?**  
We collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, send an e-card, send us an e-mail or call us, enter a sweepstakes or enroll in a club or service. This information may include the following:

  * Your name
  * Your mailing address
  * Your e-mail address
  * Your phone number
  * Your credit card number
  * Your Gold Crown Card number



It may also include information you submit about other people; for example, the name and address (e-mail and postal) of a gift recipient or e-card recipient. We only use information you submit about other people in order to deliver information, products, or services specifically requested by you.

 **Who does Hallmark share information with?**  
We will share personal customer information with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Web site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experiences; enabling access to our partners' sites; and completing credit card transactions. These third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose except fulfilling orders and servicing your questions.

In addition, we may combine the information you provide while online at Hallmark.com with information you've provided in the Hallmark Gold Crown retail stores, in order to provide a better shopping experience for you.

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your permission or you have been notified. Hallmark reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. Hallmark will have no legal liability for such disclosures.

We may also provide information to other organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our other partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

 **How does Hallmark handle contest and survey responses?**  
Periodically, Hallmark will invite customers to participate in contests and surveys. The information we collect from these contests and surveys may be associated with individual customer accounts and used by Hallmark to improve your overall customer experience. The information will only be shared with third parties in aggregate form; no individual information will be given to third parties unless we have your prior permission or you have been notified.

 **What if I am an affiliate partner?**  
If you sign up to become a Hallmark.com affiliate partner, you will be directed to a third party Web site that manages the affiliate process, and this third party is not allowed to use the information they collect for any purpose not involved in managing the affiliate process.

**What technical devices and processes does Hallmark.com use to collect information about me?**  
We use technology that allows us to identify what type of browser you are using, the web site from which you enter Hallmark.com and the pages you view as you tour our site. This technology helps us compile aggregate statistics about our online guests and their use of Hallmark.com, which allows us to make improvements in design and content to better serve you.

 **What are cookies and how does Hallmark.com use them?**  
A cookie is a small file that can be stored on your computer's hard drive. Hallmark.com uses cookies to provide features such as auto-login and to determine when customers have previously visited our site. If you choose to set your browser to reject cookies, we will not be able to make auto-login functionality available to you, including giving you access to your address book without first entering your Hallmark.com user name and password.

 **What is an IP address and how does Hallmark.com use it?** ****  
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. Like most websites, the servers that serve our Web site automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We do log IP addresses and we use them to monitor things like the number of visitors that visit our website.

 **Does Hallmark use third parties?**  
Additionally, Hallmark uses the services of MSN, Doubleclick and Yahoo! for the serving of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, MSN, Doubleclick and Yahoo! collect anonymous data from this site through the use of cookies. This anonymous data is also used to develop aggregate reports on our customer's reactions to ad campaigns and to learn more about our general audience so we may provide only the most relevant offers and promotions. 

To learn more about MSN, Doubleclick and Yahoo!, including your ability to opt out of the MSN, Doubleclick and Yahoo! systems, go to <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>, <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy> or <http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html>

**How do I access and make changes to my preferences to receive e-mail?**  
When you establish a Hallmark.com account, your account automatically indicates that you want to receive promotional information from Hallmark regarding news about Hallmark products, services and events. In addition, it automatically indicates that you would like to be informed about special offers, products and free samples from Hallmark partners. If you do not want to be contacted by Hallmark for promotional purposes, you may indicate your preference at the time of enrollment or by clicking the Your Account link at the top of any page on Hallmark.com, then logging in and choosing Personal Profile. To change your notification preference, simply uncheck the box next to the line that says "Send me Hallmark.com e-mail about Hallmark gifts and greeting specials."

 **How do I access and make changes to my personal information?**  
You can modify or delete your personal information anytime. Simply go to the Your Account link located at the top of the Hallmark.com homepage. You can update any of your personal information by choosing which information you would like to update; for example, your address book or reminder service. You will then be taken to where you can edit or submit new information.

 **How secure is the information that I provide to Hallmark?**  
**What technology does Hallmark.com use to ensure the security of credit card transactions?**  
We are committed to the highest standards in credit card security to protect the information you provide when you make a purchase at Hallmark.com. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. Hallmark.com also uses a digital secure server ID to provide you with the best possible protection on the Internet.

 **How secure is my Hallmark.com account information?**  
To protect your account information, Hallmark.com requires you to enter a valid username and password before making a purchase using your existing account information. If you choose to store your credit card information with your user account, the full credit card number will never again be displayed through your Web browser and all credit card information will be cleared any time your account is reset.

Additionally, Hallmark has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your information. Only select employees and agents of Hallmark.com have access to this information. This information is accessed for the sole purpose of completing your order.

 **Are my e-card messages confidential?**  
Your e-card messages are always considered confidential and securely protected. E-cards will only be accessed when in rare circumstances it is necessary for the purpose of completing your order. Hallmark reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. Hallmark will have no legal liability for such disclosures.

 **Are my personal messages private when I purchase gifts from Hallmark?**  
When you add a personal message to your order, it is securely protected by Hallmark. For the purposes of order fulfillment, it is possible that your message may be viewed by an order processing representative. Our partners and employees adhere to the strictest standards of confidentiality to protect your privacy.

 **Address Book**  
Hallmark.com provides you with the opportunity to use our online address book to keep track of important addresses once you have established a user account. Address book information is considered highly confidential and will not be used for promotional purposes by Hallmark or disclosed to third parties.

 **Reminder Notifications**  
Hallmark.com provides you with the opportunity to set reminders for important holidays and occasions once you have established a user account. The reminders we send at your request will often include links to our site for relevant products and other content. The more information you can provide about your gift recipient, the more relevant products we are able to suggest for your gift giving need. Reminder notification information is considered highly confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties.

 **Does Hallmark.com ensure the security and privacy practices of other sites to which it links?**  
While we carefully select the Web sites to which we link, we are not responsible for the privacy practice or the content of these Web sites. When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the Hallmark privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information.

 **How will I know when Hallmark changes its privacy policy?**  
Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers. If our information practices change materially, we will post the policy changes on the privacy page of this website to notify you of these changes. You should check our website periodically for more information on how we use the data we collect.

 **How do I contact Hallmark if I still have questions?**  
You may contact us by using the Contact Us links in our Customer Service. We try to reply promptly to every message we receive. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments and share them with our customer care team to improve our service in the future. Your personal information will only be shared with third parties in the event that we need to follow up with specific order-related questions or comments; the third parties will not use your information for promotional or any other purposes.
