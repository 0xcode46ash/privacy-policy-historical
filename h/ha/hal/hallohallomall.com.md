  * When the customer placed their order, they will receive an email confirming their order(s).  
 
  * The vendor will be in-charge of shipping the ordered item(s) to its customer.Ordered Items are expected to be delivered within 3 to 5 working days. Note that the usual cause of delay is location.  
 


  * The costumer will be given up to 7 days in order to report or request for a Return of Merchandize. Our return process is as follows: if customers get faulty products, they can request a return. However, such a request can be made only if certain conditions are met - the product must be returnable and its return period must not be over.  
 


  * When a return request is submitted, it is automatically displayed in the system, and the administrator sees which products a customer wants to return, for what reasons, and what action they want to apply (a refund or replacement). Customers are kept informed through e-mail notifications about the return authorization.



**Return / Cancellation Policy**
