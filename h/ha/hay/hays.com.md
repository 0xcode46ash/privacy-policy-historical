As this Data Protection Policy governs our processing of all personal data provided to us via the Hays.com website you are asked to please read it carefully. If you do not agree to our processing of your data in the manner outlined below, please do not submit any personal data to us. 

Hays Specialist Recruitment Limited  is registered as a data controller in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998.  We ensure that the data you supply to us is processed fairly and lawfully, and with skill and care. We take our responsibilities in respect of your Personal Data extremely seriously. 

We will collect your Personal Data in order to facilitate the recruitment process. This data will include the information you supply to us on your CV (which would include, for example, name, address and qualifications). You consent to us using the information provided by you (including, without limitation, sensitive personal data) in order to facilitate the recruitment process on your behalf and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. While we will not ordinarily seek any “sensitive personal data” (e.g. relating to health/disabilities, race/ethnicity, trade union membership, criminal convictions) from candidates, if you choose to provide any such data to us, you are giving us your explicit consent to the processing of such data in accordance with this Data Protection Policy. 

We only allow access to your Personal Data to our staff and any prospective employers or clients for the purposes outlined above.  Our staff may be in any of our group companies located in countries worldwide.   Prospective employers or clients may be located both in the European Union, and, where appropriate, following your requirements as indicated to us, outside the European Union. If we transfer your Personal Data outside the European Union in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in the Privacy Policy. 

We will also disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that we are required by law to disclose it in connection with the detection of crime, the collection of taxes or duties, in order to comply with any applicable law, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or in connection with legal proceedings.

We are required by law to hold your Personal Data for as long as is necessary to comply with our statutory and contractual obligations and in accordance with our legitimate interests as a data controller. We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your Personal Data is maintained and up to date. However, you are under a duty to inform us of any and all changes to your Personal Data to ensure that it is up to date and we will update or delete your Personal Data accordingly. To find out what Personal Data we hold on you or to have your Personal Data updated, amended or removed from our database, please email us at [feedback@hays.com](mailto:feedback@hays.com) . Any such data subject requests may be subject to our prescribed fee. 

If we have no contact with you then following the expiry of a reasonable period as we consider appropriate we will archive for file or may delete it. 

After an appropriate period we will contact you and ask if you wish for your Personal Data to be maintained on our database. If you do not indicate by signing onto the web site that you wish to have your details retained then we archive your details. 

Your Personal Data is held on secure servers hosted by us or our Internet Service Provider. The nature of the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the Internet. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. However, we will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your Personal Data. 

We reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy and provided that the third party only uses your Personal Data for the purposes that you provided it to us. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out. 

We also collect information about the way jobseekers and visitors use this website in order to improve our services.  We do not use information gained in this way in a way that any individual can be identified, and only use it to understand our users better, and to determine aggregate trends, most popular pages, etc, for all the website’s users.  We may share this kind of aggregate data with selected third parties to assist with these purposes.

 Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any time we decide to use Personal Data in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in the new manner.

We will not send you unsolicited commercial communications or contact you for direct marketing purposes unless you have indicated that you are happy for us to do so. However, we will contact you where required for the proper performance of our obligations.
