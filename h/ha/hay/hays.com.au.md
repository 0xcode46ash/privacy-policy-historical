Website Privacy Policy

At Hays we are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes you agree to. The following reflects our commitment to you. 

**General Information Collected from Visitors to the Website**  
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit more frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. 

**Your Personal Information collected on this Website**  
In some instances we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, etc. We would collect this information if you were to apply for a job via this website, or to sign up for a service, for example. We may also ask you for other information such as the types of jobs you are interested in and your workplace concerns in order to provide you with the best possible service and internet experience. 

Hays also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply edit your account preferences. 

**General Information Disclosure**  
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to the Haysâ€™ website, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. If the position you are applying for is in a country other than Australia, by submitting your application to us, you are agreeing to your personal details being forwarded to our offices, and possibly to employers, in that country. 

**Feedback**  
Hays have several areas on the website where you can submit feedback. Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of Hays. We may use this feedback, such as success stories or responses to surveys, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site. 

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy for our website, we will post these changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our commitment to your privacy, please feel free to email our Privacy Officer at [privacy@hays.com.au](mailto:privacy@hays.com.au) or call our Customer Service Hotline on 1800 805 051.
