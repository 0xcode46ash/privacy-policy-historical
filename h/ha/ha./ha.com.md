**Heritage Privacy Policy**

**Your right to privacy is honored by Heritage.**  
Any information that you provide to us is personal, private, and valuable. When you choose to provide us with information, we realize that you trust us and expect us to act responsibly. Our policy is that all information that you provide will be used ONLY to better serve you.

As our relationship with you and our other customers grows, this privacy policy will change to better serve everyone. Check back periodically for updates and feel free to contact us at any time with questions or suggestions regarding this policy. This privacy policy was last updated on July 23, 2004.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Heritage by either e-mail ([webmaster@HA.com](mailto:webmaster@HA.com)) or writing us at the following address:

Heritage Auction Galleries

  1. What personal information do we collect and why?  

  2. How does Heritage use your information?  

  3. With whom does Heritage share your information?  

  4. What are cookies and how are they used?  

  5. What security measures are in place to protect your personal information?  

  6. Reviewing and changing your information  


**What personal information do we collect and why?**  
We collect any and/or all of the following, depending on what particular form you fill out. Our surveys and contests collect your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and information about your collecting and selling habits and interests. Our free E-listings require only an e-mail address. Our registration for participating in online auctions collects your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and a valid Visa or Mastercard number. The credit card information is used for a credit check only, and is not charged for any reason unless you personally authorize charges to that card at a later time for a particular purchase. Your credit card information is held in strictest confidence and protected by multiple layers of security.

We automatically record your IP address, session duration, transaction data, the order and addresses of the pages you visit, and in most cases the data that you enter on those pages. We use all of this information to improve the navigation, functionality, and general service that our Web site provides.

If you provide us with your e-mail address, you will automatically begin receiving e-mails from us on a variety of subjects. If you wish to block your e-mail address from receiving any e-mails from Heritage, you may do so quickly and easily by sending an e-mail to [webmaster@HA.com](mailto:webmaster@HA.com) with "REMOVE" in the subject line.

**How does Heritage use your information?**  
Heritage researches our customers' usage patterns and demographics based on the information provided to us during their experiences on our Web site. We do this to better understand our customers' needs and enhance our service. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis for internal use only and is not shared with any parties outside of Heritage.

Registration qualifies user as a Heritage customer and regardless of any regulation to the contrary agrees, until this consent is revoked in writing, that Heritage may from time to time contact user concerning sale and purchase opportunities available through Heritage.

 **With whom does Heritage share your information?**  
No one - for any reason. All information is held in confidence by Heritage. Any information disseminated to parties external to Heritage is anonymous in nature -- for example: the prices realized for a particular auction may include the price paid for a lot, but it will not include information concerning the person who purchased that lot.

**What are cookies and how are they used?**  
The internet browser that you use to view our site allows a small file called a "cookie" to be saved on your hard drive. This cookie enables our Web server to recognize you as a first-time or repeat customer and may include information such as your User Name so that you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit. We also use cookies to provide customized and personalized services to you. Your browser does allow you to turn off or warn you about cookies from our site and from any other Web sites. Cookies do not allow us to know anything about your surfing habits on other Web sites. They simply tell us about your surfing habits on our Web site.

**How do we ensure the protection of your personal information?**  
Security measures are in place that protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information. Heritage servers are protected around-the-clock through multiple security layers, including a firewall and system architecture that prevent unauthorized access to any data not specifically provided on the Web site.

In the areas of our Web site where you must provide a User Name and password, only you have access to your information. In the interest of privacy and security, we automatically expire your session when a specific period goes by without activity so that if someone else were to gain access to your computer they still would not be able to view your information on our site.

**Reviewing and changing your information**  
You can edit and change the information that Heritage has concerning you, including your User Name and password, by [editing your profile](https://web.archive.org/common/myprofile.php). If you have forgotten your password, we will [send it to you immediately via e-mail](https://web.archive.org/common/ForgotPwd.php) at your request.
