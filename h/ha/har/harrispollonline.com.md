Our most well known poll, _The Harris Poll_ ®, is quoted by the media several hundred times every month.

2) Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites

**

> **
> 
> Information Collected During the Registration Process
> 
> **
> 
> Individuals can join our growing database of survey respondents by registering at our HarrisPollOnline.com or HarrisZone.com websites, and via links to the HarrisPollOnline.com registration pages from our main corporate website [www.HarrisInteractive.com](http://www.harrisinteractive.com/), European and Japanese web sites,[ ](file:///C:/TEMP/FrontPageTempDir/www.hieurope.com)[www.HIEurope.com](http://www.hieurope.com/), [www.aaa.co.jp/adams](http://www.aaa.co.jp/adams), and [www.hpol.co.jp](http://www.hpol.co.jp/), or when registering on the websites of third parties with whom we have developed business relationships. Registration through these various means work as follows:
> 
>   * During the registration process on HarrisPollOnline.com (a site directed towards, intended for, and appealing to adults) we require individuals to provide us with contact information (e.g., name and email address) and demographic information (e.g., gender, birth date, city, state, zip code, and country). To allow individuals to modify their submissions at a later point in time, we also ask registrants to establish a username and password. This means that if an individual under the age of 13 attempts to register, their registration information will be collected, but automatically deleted.
>   * During the registration process on HarrisZone.com we require individuals to provide us with the same contact information as on the HarrisPollOnline.com website. We also request that individuals provide their parent’s email address. This enables us to contact the parent if parental permission is required for a particular study due to its subject nature or software download requirements. Children under age 13 are not permitted to register on HarrisZone.com, and are blocked from registering via a session cookie. Adults are directed to HarrisPollOnline.com.
>   * Our European and Japanese web sites ([www.HIEurope.com](http://www.hieurope.com/), [www.aaa.co.jp/adams](http://www.aaa.co.jp/adams), and [www.hpol.co.jp](http://www.hpol.co.jp/)) link to the HarrisPollOnline.com registration process indicated above. These sites are focused on European and Japanese individuals, respectively.
>   * Potential survey site members age 13 or over may also have been recruited on our behalf by third party websites, who forwarded to us your information, with your consent. Any additional information we collect from you, for example, to complete registration (if it was not already completed by the third party) or during a survey is subject to this privacy policy.
>   * Individuals have the opportunity, in certain cases, to register in their native language by selecting from a set of available languages on the main registration page.
> 
**
> 
> Other Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites
> 
> **
> 
> As part of the survey process, we often ask members other demographic information (e.g., income level), and other information related to interests, hobbies, and product/technology usage. We collect this information so that we can send surveys to members that correspond with their interests, and aggregate the responses received by various broad categories to report the aggregated results to our clients. We also summarize information about the panel to develop statistics ensuring that the panel is representative of the general population. Finally, we use this information to pre-qualify panel members for future market research reports that target certain demographics (male vs. female, age, etc.).
> 
> Harris Interactive offers an incentive program, HIpointsSM, where members of its survey sites can accumulate points towards award redemption based on the number of eligible surveys in which they participate. This program is open only to members in limited countries. To redeem HIpoints, members must provide full name and shipping information so that we can deliver the selected items.
> 
> Visitors to certain of our websites are provided email forms to contact us if they have questions, comments, are interested in job opportunities, or require further information on our products or services. Responses to such inquiries may be sent via email or regular mail.

> **Information Collected Passively on Harris Interactive Websites**
> 
> Like other websites on the Internet, we use a variety of mechanisms to keep our sites running smoothly and ensure that your experience is a pleasant one. We use cookies, small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive, to collect information such as browser, type of computer, operating system, Internet service provider, access times and other similar information. We also use cookies to retain your username and password. This feature allows us to recognize our members every time they return to the sites. Although, for your protection you are still required to log in each time you visit in order to access password-protected areas of our sites, such as the "Member Services" area, which contains the personally identifiable information you have provided to us. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to participate in our surveys, or to visit our websites. Harris Interactive also permits certain third party suppliers to set clear GIFs on the Harris Poll registrations obtained through such third parties’ websites to enable them to measure the effectiveness of their panelist recruiting campaigns.

> We will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the results of the surveys. We may also notify you about new features on our websites, or other products or services related to the primary purpose of our business in which we think you may be interested. From time to time we may also invite our members to enter a sweepstakes or participate in other incentive programs, most of which are related to the running of our surveys. Any additional information you provide when participating in an online sweepstakes or other online incentive program we host is subject to this privacy policy. We are not in the business of sending "spam" or unsolicited emails.
> 
> As part of our survey research process, we gather, aggregate, and analyze information from our panelists. We provide the results of our research (which contain no personally identifiable information) to our clients, which include governmental agencies, major corporations, and other organizations. Your survey responses are valuable in guiding the development and designing of products and services. Panel members’ survey responses are often used by our clients to make decisions on key issues.

> Sharing Information
> 
> **
> 
> Harris Interactive is not in the business of selling your personally identifiable information. We use the information you provide to us for internal purposes, and share it only for the limited purposes described here:

>   * In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share your information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as merchandise (HIpoints rewards) fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. They may also collect information on our behalf. For example, the HIpoints program is managed by our agent, Incentive Logic. A limited amount of your registration information is provided to Incentive Logic for purposes of running the HIpoints program. This information is kept in confidence and not used for any other purpose than to establish and track your earned HIpoints. Incentive Logic operates the HIpoints program in accordance with our privacy guidelines and does not share your personal information with any third party without your permission.
>   * In the case of our international medical professional panel, which is joint development effort of Harris Interactive and IMS Health Inc., the resulting database of respondents is available for use by both Harris Interactive and IMS Health Inc. for survey purposes. Harris Interactive’s use of personal information you provide as part of the international medical professional panel is subject to the same provisions as indicated herein for Harris Poll OnlineSM registrants.
>   * As a company that makes money on market research, protecting survey participants’ privacy has been an important part of our business long before the advent of the Internet. We know that you will not want to complete a survey if your personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, which is why we participated in industry-wide efforts to protect consumer information, even before we began conducting surveys online. We only release summarized or non-personally identifiable information to our clients and require your consent prior to releasing any personally identifiable information that you provide during the survey process. Clients that receive personally identifiable information are required to sign and abide by CASRO’s "Standards Regarding Disclosure of Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients."
>   * Harris Interactive is a thriving and expanding business, and like other companies, we sometimes acquire or spin off new business units. As part of such transfers, we convey the business assets of the particular business unit, including survey participant data.
>   * **Legal Disclaimer:** Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

4) Accessing the Information You Provided

**

> ****
> 
> Not only is it important for our members to be able to correct their information, it is important to us. The results from our public surveys (which report aggregate, non-identifiable information) often get reported by the media. We encourage members to keep their account profiles up-to-date, so that we continue to have accurate demographic information behind our results. We wouldn’t want to count a member’s vote in the California election if that member has since moved to Rhode Island!!!

>   * Visit the [HarrisPollOnline](http://www.harrispollonline.com/) website, log in, and update your information.

5) Your Options on Harris Interactive Websites

**

> ****
> 
> We are committed to giving you the maximum amount of flexibility in accessing your information, and in the level of participation you have with our sites. In each email invitation sent to members of our respondent database, we provide the opportunity to opt out of receipt of further mailings. This opt-out opportunity deactivates the member's account and terminates their membership with Harris Interactive. Our survey invitations inform you about the subject matter of the survey in which we would like your input, whether it is in the category of public opinion, current trends and activities, or products and services. If you are willing to participate in the survey, great! If not, that’s OK too. Any personally identifiable information that you provide during the survey process will be subject to your consent prior to release to our client. Should you grant release of such information, and then change your mind, all you need do is to send an email to [surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com](mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com).
> 
> If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to be a member of the Harris Interactive respondent database, you may send an email request with the word "unsubscribe" to [surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com](mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com). Panel members can also opt out by filling out a request on the Member Services section of the website. We will retain your information in our "unsubscribe" database, to ensure that we do not contact you in the future.
> 
> Parents, you may unsubscribe your children who are registered members of HarrisZone.com by sending an email to [surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com](mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com) with the first name of the child you would like to unsubscribe, and the website in which they are a member. The message must come from the email account provided as the "parent’s email account."
> 
> Parents, if we invite your 13-to-17 year old children to participate in surveys addressing sensitive topics on our HarrisZone.com site, we may notify you first, depending on the nature of the survey involved. If notified, you will be asked if you will allow your child to participate. We will not notify the child about the survey or ask him or her to participate without your permission. For the most sensitive of subjects, we typically do not recruit potential child panelists through our HarrisZone.com membership, but instead ask the adult members of our HarrisPollOnline.com website if they have any children in the appropriate age level that they would be willing to have participate in the survey in question.

**

6) Safety and Security

**

> ****
> 
> The HarrisPollOnlineSM and the HarrisZoneSM websites have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We will not activate a potential registrant’s account without confirmation. Once the registration process is completed, the individual is sent an email that requests he or she confirm his or her registration. The account will not be activated until confirmation is received. Additionally, all website members are required to use passwords and usernames when registering, updating their contact information, or when accessing "members only" sections of the websites. If a member cannot remember his or her password, he or she can send a message to the website’s Help Desk to retrieve it. To protect the security of our members’ contact information, requests to retrieve passwords must include information to allow us to verify the member’s identity.
> 
> We employ standard technology and internal processes to protect the information our members release to us. Additionally, only select, authorized employees have access to process the data collected and maintain the database that stores member contact information. All questions are screened by Harris Interactive staff prior to being deployed to ensure they are proper and appropriate for their intended audiences.
> 
> **
> 
> A Note to Parents:
> 
> **
> 
> We encourage parents and guardians to be involved in their children’s activities on the Web. Individuals registering for the HarrisZoneSM are encouraged to provide their parent’s email address so that we can notify the parent when the child has registered. A parent or guardian may unsubscribe their child from the HarrisZoneSM at any time by sending an email to the Help Desk on the registration site. In addition, this site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and change of the information under our control.

7) Notification of Changes

**

> ****
> 
> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
> 
> If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
