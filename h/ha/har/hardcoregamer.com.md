# Hardcore Gamer Magazine Online

We know that your privacy is important to you. It's important to us, too. That's why we want you to know about the personal information we collect, how we use that information and with whom it may be shared. You're always in control. 

**Information Collection and Use**

 **Information Collection**

DoubleJump Publishing is the sole owner of the information collected on HardcoreGamer.com. DoubleJump collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

 **Registration**

In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to provide a more personalized experience on our site. We also periodically award prizes to our members and we use their contact information to send prizes to.

 **Order**

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

 **Information Use**

From time to time we provide aggregate statistics about our members, site traffic, and other site-related information to reputable companies. "Aggregate" is the key word here. You can be assured that we never include information that allows these companies to identify you individually. 

**Profile**

We never rent or sell your name, phone number and mailing address to other marketers of products or services without your consent.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to log in access any of the team tools.

 **Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Communications from the Site**

 **Special Offers and Updates**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

 **Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

 **Service Announcements**

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

 **Customer Service**

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

 **Sharing Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

 **Choice/Opt-out**

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our registration form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who sign up but do not wish to receive team-related emails, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the opt-out mechanism on the "user profile" page.

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

 **Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Invite a Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. DoubleJump will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. DoubleJump does not store this information. 

**Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

 **Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [jason@hardcoregamer.com](mailto:jason@hardcoregamermag.com)

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

 **Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the "User Profile" page or by emailing our Customer Support at [jason@hardcoregamer.com](mailto:jason@hardcoregamermag.com).

 **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. 

**Contact Information**

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us atÂ  [jason@hardcoregamer.com](mailto:jason@hardcoregamermag.com).
