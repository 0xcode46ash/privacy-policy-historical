At Harris Teeter, your privacy is our concern. We will not sell or give your name, address, email address or personal information to anyone.

We will occasionally use customer purchase records and other information to offer special promotions or coupons to our customers. But we do not share personal information with anyone outside of Harris Teeter. If you prefer not to receive these special offers, just select the "opt out" box located on the VIC online application form and (for existing VIC Card holders) on the VIC online change form.

We also understand the special privacy needs of children. Therefore, we have adopted the following policies regarding children and the "Harry's Fun Page" section of our web site.

| a) | We will not collect personal information such as name, home addresses, e-mail addresses, phone number, or other personally identifying information from children who visit the "Harry's Fun Page" section of HarrisTeeter.com.  
  
---|---  
b) | We will not give children access or provide links to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information.  
  
c) | We will not provide information, pictures, graphics, games, or links to web sites that are unsuitable for children.  
  
d) | We will encourage children to get their parent's permission before using the Internet, sending us e-mails, or providing any form of personally identifiable information to any web site.
