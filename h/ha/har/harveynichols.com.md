# Privacy and Security

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Please be assured that we take your privacy very seriously and treat all your personal information as confidential. This policy relates to your use of this website; the data you supply to us (including data gathered in our stores) and our use of that data.

**Collection, Use and Storage of Data**

**What sort of data do you collect?**

**Personal Information**

When you shop on this website, you will be asked to input personal information such as your name, e-mail address, billing address, delivery address, telephone number(s), product selections and a password. Basic personal details, including your name and email address, are also requested when you sign up to receive our email newsletter.

We may ask you for your date of birth (optional), which will be used to identify you if you wish to make changes to your account or your order by telephone.

We do not store credit or debit card information.

**Your Use of Our Website**

We also collect, and our third party providers may collect, information about where you have come from on the Internet and how you are accessing the site (e.g. the URL you came from before you visited this website and your IP address), your browser type, your geographical location, the pages of our website you viewed during your visit, the advertisements you clicked on, and any search terms that you entered. We may collect this information about all visitors, even those that do not register with us. For more info, see **Cookies** below.

**How do you use this data?**

  * To process your orders, from delivery to payment and returns. 
  * To send you marketing communications, where you have requested them.
  * For analytical purposes, to learn about how shoppers are using our website. This helps us improve and personalise the site and its services to you. 
  * To prevent or detect fraud and abuses of our website.



**How do you keep my personal information and payment details secure?**

All information about our customers and site visitors is kept on a secure server and we fully comply with all applicable UK data protection and consumer legislation. Any personal information you give us (or is available on public registers) and any information we use to identify you, is held in accordance with our registration with the Information Commissioner's Office.

**SSL and Encryption Technology**

We have implemented Internet security technology to ensure that it is safe for you to shop with us. We use Internet standard encryption technology to scramble your personal data when you give it to us. This process is known as SSL (secure sockets layer) and we are constantly updating our technology to provide you with the maximum level of security.

To check you are in a secure area of our website, you can look at the bottom right of your browser window and you will see a closed padlock or an unbroken key. This indicates that SSL is enabled and your transaction is secure.

Additionally, we do not hold any of your credit card details anywhere on our website. They are simply passed securely to our E-payments processor for authorisation by your bank.

**MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa (3D Secure)**

MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa are new services that let you shop online with added confidence and security and protect you from fraud.

To use MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa all you need to do is register your card once, and create a password. Then, when you make a purchase online, a MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa window will appear. Simply enter the characters requested from your password and click on the submit query button. Your identity is verified and the purchase is secure.

If you are registered for the scheme and have a password already, you will be asked to enter characters from your password after you have entered the card details and clicked on the ‘continue to payment’. Your card provider will then verify the characters you have entered and, if it matches their records, verify your transaction.

If your card provider is registered for the scheme but you personally are not, we will offer you the chance to sign up and create a password during the check out process. This is all handled through MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa themselves. We simply pass your encrypted details on to your card provider securely.

If you would like further information, please contact your Mastercard or Visa Issuer.

**What you can do to stay secure**

There are things you can do to protect your personal information and transactions when shopping online. Here are a few of them:

  * When using a public computer, always log out and close the browser when you have finished. 
  * Do not share your password with anybody else or write it down anywhere. 
  * When you create a password, use at least 8 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. Do not use any personal information in your password (such as your name) that can be easily obtained. We also recommended that you change your password often. 
  * Use different passwords for your different online accounts.



**Marketing Communications**

You can sign up to receive marketing communications from Harvey Nichols through the online sign up form, when you register for an online account or via the opt-in tick box found during the check out process. Opt-in boxes will be pre-ticked on your behalf but you may always choose to un-tick the box. You can also sign up for marketing communications in store, when making a restaurant booking, when entering competitions or using online services that require registration, such as the Wishlist.

In signing up, you consent to receive information from us about products, promotions or special offers that we feel may be of interest to you. These may be sent by email, mail, telephone, SMS message or take place in store. Promotions may also be sent to you based on your shopping history.

**How to Unsubscribe from Email Communications**

You can unsubscribe from our newsletter via the unsubscribe link provided in all e-mails we send, by replying to any marketing email with the word ‘STOP’ either in the subject line or body of the email or by telephoning our Web Customer Services team on 0845 604 1888. Overseas customers should call +44 160 466 2788 or email compliance@harveynichols.com. 

Please be aware, it may take up to 15 days to stop receiving e-mails and a later opt-in will supercede an earlier opt out.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

If we are requested by the police or any other regulatory or government authority investigating suspected illegal activities, to provide your personal information and /or user information, we will do so.

Your Personal Information may be disclosed to other businesses within the Harvey Nichols Group of companies and to reputable third parties, who will help process your order. These may include our IT suppliers, courier or shipping companies. 

We may also disclose your information to reputable third companies for the purpose of insight and analysis and to third party companies, where you have opted in for third party promotions. We require all such third parties to treat your personal information as fully confidential and to fully comply with all applicable UK Data Protection and consumer legislation in place.

With your prior approval, we may also pass your details to third parties or research agencies who may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone. We may also share aggregate information with selected third parties but we do not disclose individual names or any identifying information, without your permission.

If you have provided your details as part of a promotion with a third party and have agreed for us to share your data with them, we will do so on your behalf.
