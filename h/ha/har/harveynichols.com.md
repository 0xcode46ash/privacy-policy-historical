**What is a cookie and what is it used for?**

  
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by Your browser on Your computer hard drive. They contain no recognisable Personal Information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of how often You visit Our site, the contents of Your shopping cart, previous purchases and to deliver content specific to Your interests. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but usually You can alter the settings of Your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If You choose not to receive cookies, You may still use most of the features of Our website, including the ability to purchase items. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, You can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We advise You not to use cookies if Your computer is shared by other people. You can accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or modify Your browser to alert You of any new cookies. Cookies also protect the integrity of registered passwords and limit access to 'paid for' services.

**Security**

For your security and protection and to prevent fraud, all orders packed by us are monitored and recorded by CCTV to ensure that we don't leave anything out of your order.

We have implemented internet security technology to ensure that it is safe for You to shop with Us. We use Internet standard encryption technology to scramble Your Personal Data when You transmit it to Us. This process is known as SSL (secure sockets layer) and We are constantly updating Our technology to provide You with the maximum practicable level of security. To check You are in a secure area of Our Web site You can look at the bottom right of Your browser window and You will see a closed padlock or an unbroken key. This indicates that SSL is enabled and Your transaction is secure.

If You double click on the padlock You will be able to verify that We are trusted by Verisign, one of the World's leading security companies. To check the validity of the certificate click on the View button. You should see that the certificate is registered for Harvey Nichols and has not expired. 

Additionally We do not hold any of Your credit card details anywhere on Our Website. They are simply passed securely to Our E-payments processor for authorisation by Your bank.

**MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa (3D Secure)**

MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa are new services that let You shop online with added confidence.

Through a simple checkout process, MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa confirm Your identity when You make purchases at participating online stores. It is convenient, and it works with Your existing MasterCard or Visa card.

Plus, MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa are a snap to use. You register Your card just once, and create Your own password. Then, when You make purchases at participating online stores, a MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa window will appear. Simply enter the characters requested from Your password and click on the submit query button. Your identity is verified and the purchase is secure.

If You are registered for the scheme and have a password already You will be asked to enter characters from this password after You have typed in the card details and clicked on the continue to payment button from the card information page. Your card provider will then verify what You have entered and, if it matches their records, verify Your transaction. Your purchase is secure.

If Your card provider is registered for the scheme but You personally are not, We will offer You the chance to subscribe to it and create a password. This is all handled through MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa themselves. We simply pass Your encrypted details through to Your card provider securely.

Registration in the scheme provides You with a higher level of security when shopping on-line as there is no way for a fraudster to know the personal password You create for Yourself. 

Alternatively, to activate MasterCard SecureCode for Your MasterCard card or Verified by Visa for Your Visa card, or to learn more, contact the card provider that issued Your MasterCard or Visa card.

**Safety and Security Tips**

•    When using a public computer or terminal, always log out and close the browser when You complete an online session.   
•    Do not tell anyone else Your password. Remember, anybody who knows Your password can access Your account or pass Your password on to someone else.   
•    Create more complex passwords. When You create a password, use at least 8 characters - a combination of letters and numbers is best. Do not use Your name, email address, or other personal information that can be easily obtained and try to steer clear of words found in a dictionary. It is also recommended that You change Your password frequently.   
•    Use different passwords for any online accounts You have.   
•    Do not write Your password down anywhere.
