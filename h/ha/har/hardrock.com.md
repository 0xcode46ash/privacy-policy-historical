WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Personal Information from this Website is gathered in two ways: (1) indirectly, i.e., certain website information about you, such as domain name, browser type and page views, which is collected through our site's technology; and (2) directly, when you voluntarily submit Personal Information such as, first and last names, addresses and email address(es) in connection with various marketing and promotional activities conducted on the Website. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for information and how this information will be used.

RIGHT NOT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right not to provide Personal Information. However, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to utilize certain services on this Website.

COOKIES

Some information that we collect about you is collected passively through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small files of information, which save and retrieve information about your visit to the Website - for example, how you entered and navigated our site, and what information was of interest to you. We use this information to remember you when you return and to customize our Website to your preferences. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, you may find that some parts of the Website will not function properly if cookies are refused.

ACCESS AND CORRECTION

When required in your jurisdiction, Hard Rock will permit individuals to access, correct, amend or delete Personal Information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. If you request access, correction, amendment or deletion of your Personal Information and you have more than one account with us, you will need to instruct us on each account separately. Reasonable access to Personal Information will generally be provided within thirty (30) calendar days at no cost to you, subject to limited exceptions prescribed by law. Please note that personal profile information supplied by you on-line at the Website can be accessed by you on-line at any time and at no charge.

SUBSCRIBERS/ORDERS

In order to use and participate in certain programs or services offered by Hard Rock via this Website, you must first complete a registration form. In order to use or participate in such programs and services, we will need to collect certain Personal Information about you, such as your name, email address and contact details, and, if applicable, credit card payment information. This information is used to communicate with you about specific services, offers, benefits and features on our Website for which you have expressed interest or registered for. For some Website services, you will be asked to provide a password and user identification. This information is collected to confirm eligibility for use of the online services and to establish the identity of the authorized user. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that password and user identification.

SURVEYS & CONTESTS

From time-to-time our Website may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Contact information will be used to administer your participation in a contest, notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be collected and used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website and our other products and services.

HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH

During the course of business, we may disclose, transfer or otherwise make available Personal Information to our affiliates and third-party service providers who have been legally contracted to provide services on our behalf, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

Your Personal Information may be maintained and processed by our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US, Canada or other jurisdictions. For information on the way in which our service providers treat your Personal Information, please contact us as set out below.

We or our affiliates or our Canadian, US and other service providers may also need to disclose your Personal Information where required by law, court order, search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required by Canadian, US or other law. We may also disclose your Personal Information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property, or as otherwise permitted by law.

We may transfer your Personal Information as an asset in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.

CHOICE/OPT-IN

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' to having their Personal Information used for purposes not directly related to the purposes for which it has been collected. For example, our online Rock Shop retail merchandise order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product or register for a service from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

HARD ROCK â€“3RD PARTY DISCLOSURE POLICY

We may, under limited circumstances, send you offers for related products or services from affiliated Hard Rock companies or jointly offered by Hard Rock together with select third parties. These offers are sent only to those users who have not 'opted-out' of receiving marketing materials from Hard Rock.

CONSENT TO SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

As a global organization, data we collect may be transferred internationally throughout Hard Rock's worldwide organization to Hard Rock's headquarters in the United States. Some of these foreign jurisdictions may not provide the same level of privacy protection as your local jurisdiction. By purchasing Services and submitting Personal Information through the Website, you consent to such transfers of your Personal Information. Without such consent, Hard Rock is not able to provide you with access to its online Services and other programs.

PUBLIC FORUMS

This Website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information you disclose in a public forum will be available to other visitors to our Website. To the extent you disclose your Personal Information in public forums, the use of the information by third-parties will not be subject to this Privacy Policy.
