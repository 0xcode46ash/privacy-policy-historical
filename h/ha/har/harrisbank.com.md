This information allows us to:

**How do we know the information we maintain about you is accurate?**

Harris has established procedures so that our information about you is accurate, current and complete. If you ever discover inaccuracies in our data, or if your personal information changes, we urge you to notify us immediately by calling toll-free 1-888-340-2265, so that we can make the necessary changes.

We limit access to the information we have about you to those employees who need to know to provide you with a full range of services to help you meet your financial needs. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal laws and regulations to guard your information. 

**When do we share information about you?**

We may share within Harris Bank and its affiliates the information we collect about you. However, you as a consumer, have a right to instruct us not to share among our banks and affiliated financial service companies certain information (other than information about our transactions or experiences with you) from your account applications or information we receive from third parties. Please see our Privacy Policy ([Click Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20020605030954id_/http%3A//www.harrisbank.com/privacy_full.html)) for more information. 

In addition, we may share information about you with companies outside the Harris Bank organization to complete a transaction you have requested, to help service your account, to provide us operational support, and with other financial institutions with which we have a joint marketing agreement. These companies are not permitted to use your information for anything beyond the intended service and agree to strict standards regarding security and confidentially. 

These companies may include:   


  * Non-financial companies that perform services for us such as printing your check orders, data processing, and companies that perform marketing services on our behalf.  

  * Financial service providers, including other banks, insurance companies or mortgage companies. For example, we have an arrangement with another financial institution to offer you Harris Bank credit cards.   




We may also share information when required by law or authorized by you. Examples include responding to a subpoena, conducting a fraud investigation, or reporting to a credit bureau.

**Cookies**

It's important to us that your experience with the Harris Web site is effective and satisfying. To accomplish this, we use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browsers. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our Web Page Server so it can be read back later from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember specific information, such as pass codes and log in identification. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or collect personally identifiable information to determine who you are, or capture your e-mail address. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet.

One of the most beneficial uses of cookies is site personalization, where you are able to customize the information you see. For example, by using cookies as part of our internet banking, you can personalize your site. Each time you access your internet banking homepage, the browser will remember your preferences until the cookie expires. Harris also uses cookies to identify what sections of our site are visited most often so we can provide more information on the topics and subjects that our customers are interested in. 

You may determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by your system by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, since some of our applications use cookies to manage your session, disabling a cookie may cause some banking functions to not work properly.

**Additional Information**

To provide you with the best online services, we may direct you to other sites on the Web to provide additional information or services that may be of interest to you. Whenever you leave a Harris Bank site, we encourage you to view the privacy policy of the new site. 

**Your best defense with protecting your information on any online service is to make sure you sign-off and close the browser once you have completed transacting business.**
