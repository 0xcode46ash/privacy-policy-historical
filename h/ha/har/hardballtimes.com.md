# Privacy Policy – The Hardball Times

What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how Hardball Times treats personal information that Hardball Times collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Hardball Times products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Hardball Times does not own or control, or to people that Hardball Times does not employ or manage.

Information Collection and Use

Hardball Times collects personal information when you register with Hardball Times, when you use Hardball Times products or services, when you visit Hardball Times pages or the pages of certain Hardball Times partners. Hardball Times may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Hardball Times and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.  
Hardball Times collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.

Hardball Times automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Hardball Times cookie information, and the page you request.

Hardball Times uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Hardball Times does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Hardball Times under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Hardball Times communicate with you about offers from Hardball Times and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Hardball Times’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Hardball Times is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Hardball Times will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Hardball Times displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria – for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

Hardball Times does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

Hardball Times advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

Cookies

Hardball Times lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Hardball Times’s cookies.

Hardball Times uses web beacons to access Hardball Times cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Hardball Times products and services.

These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
