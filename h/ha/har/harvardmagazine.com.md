# Privacy Policy | Harvard Magazine

This page discloses the information-gathering and -dissemination practices for this website, [harvardmagazine.com](http://harvardmagazine.com/), and its companion web app, [app.harvardmagazine.com](http://app.harvardmagazine.com/).

### Information Gathering and Usage

We collect and store e-mail addresses; however, we do not share or sell e-mail addresses or any other personally identifiable information about our Web visitors outside of Harvard—including those visitors who make donations through our site.

Besides e-mail addresses, the information we may request on our Web forms includes: names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and descriptive information (such as one’s Harvard affiliation and graduation year). We use this information to respond to specific requests, to personalize our communications, to communicate with subsets of our target audience, or to allow visitors to identify themselves when making use of such features as Cambridge 02138 (letters to the editor), website comments, and alumni class notes. If you do not wish to use our Web forms, please see our [contact](http://harvardmagazine.com/contact) page for alternate ways to communicate with  _Harvard Magazine._

Some members of _Harvard Magazine_ ’s staff are authorized to cross-check information collected by this website against information stored in Harvard University databases (maintained elsewhere). _Harvard Magazine_  does not retain external data; when we are authorized to access Harvard University data, we handle it very carefully, use it only for specific business purposes, and then discard it using secure means. 

Our Web server generates log files of the [IP addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of computers that access this website and of what files they access. These logs may be archived. 

We use [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to maintain a user’s identity between Web sessions. 

Our website uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) tracking software. We use it to generate statistical reports and learn how people use our website. We share information about our Web traffic with business partners (such as advertisers), but these reports never contain personally identifiable information. 

Our website uses third-party ad serving software to display its advertising. The software is provided by [Google AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense), [Google DoubleClick for Publishers](https://www.google.com/dfp/info/welcome.html), [AdSpeed](http://www.adspeed.com/), and [AdTech](http://www.adtech.com/en/). This software uses cookies to identify [unique visitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_visitor)—frequently tracking visitors across multiple websites. 

Our website uses third-party sharing tools (such as a tool that allows you to e-mail articles to friends by clicking links on our pages). Specifically, we use [AddThis.com](http://www.addthis.com/), which maintains its own [privacy policy](http://www.addthis.com/privacy). 

This website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites.

### Security

_Harvard Magazine_ has taken reasonable precautions to secure the personal information collected. The alumni notes and obituaries section of this site, for example, is password-protected to allow access to registered users only. Registration and subsequent access to class notes and obituaries is limited to members of the Harvard community.

Systems that relay payment information are [PCI-compliant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard).
