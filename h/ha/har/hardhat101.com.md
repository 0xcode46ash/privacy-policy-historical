# HardHat101 - Information

Nubian101.comÂ  Network Inc. has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the World Wide Web site located at www.Nubian101.com (the "Nubian101 Site"). We believe very strongly that private information should remain private. We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please [ Contact Us.](mailto:nubian101@gmail.com?subject=Contact%20Us%20Nubian101.com)

Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. 

**NUBIAN101 GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:**

**Cookies**  
Our Web site sets cookies to administer our site, to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our Web site for you, and to save your member name and city so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit. 

A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell us to do so; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your Web browser would be able to access the Nubian101 Site as you if you choose to store your member name and password. Nubian101's Web servers also set session ID cookies that are used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their Web browsers to refuse them; however, doing so may prevent certain parts of Nubian101's site from working (e.g., anything that requires login, including member chat, etc). While cookies set by Nubian101 may be used to collect personally identifiable information and can be traced to an individual user, this personally identifiable information is used only for internal purposes., 

**Registration Form**  
Membership on the Nubian101 Site is completely optional. Nubian101's registration form requires users to give their email address. On our join form, required fields are marked. Nubian101 will never share e-mail addresses with third party organizations without your express permission. 

**Control of Your Password**  
**Do not disclose** your password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. To change your password you can do so at any time through the MY ACCOUNT page then click [ Change Password](http://www.nubian101.com/edit_profile&s=password). 

**Order Forms**  
When purchasing products or services on the Nubian101 site, you're asked for credit card, billing, and shipping information. This information is transmitted using a secure, encrypted form. You can see that the transaction is secure from the fact that the URL begins with the secure address https:// and we ensure encryption through the use of standard SSL encryption technologies. 

This credit card information is gathered to bill customers for services purchased. Only billing vendors have access to financial information and only for the purpose of billing customers. At times Nubian101 may refer users to other Web sites to purchase products or services. User activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites. 

**Community Tools**  
Nubian101 provides many venues for member interaction and community. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms) may reveal a user's member name or e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information on the Nubian101 Site. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas (e.g. profile page) of the Nubian101 Site, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not post in public areas of the Nubian101 Site. 

**Nubian101 Profiles and PRO ads**  
Nubian101 permits users to submit adult-oriented personal information for use in the Nubian101 Profile and PRO ad services. This information is also stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and to customize the user's Nubian101 site experience. By registering for Nubian101 Profiles or PRO ad and submitting your user information, you understand that the information provided in the profile or PRO ad, including your photograph, may be forwarded by members to other members and to persons who are not members. Nubian101 will not knowingly collect Profile or PRO ad information from those under the age of 18\. 

**Member Feedback**  
Nubian101 stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the Nubian101 Site and associated services and at times may be shared with Nubian101 partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific identifying characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address or name) removed. 

**IP Addresses**  
Nubian101 tracks individual IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. 

**ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS**  
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, Nubian101 may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties. 

Nubian101 believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should generally remain confidential. Nubian101 does not read or disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is available to all Nubian101 members, and in many cases other visitors to the Nubian101 site. Also keep in mind that Nubian101 is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat and instant message-like conversations pass through Nubian101's servers, we do not store logs of these conversations. 

Nubian101 reserves the right to share some or all of your personal information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control with Nubian101, in which case Nubian101 will require such entities to honor this privacy policy. If Nubian101 is acquired by another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by Nubian101 and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy policy regarding that information.
