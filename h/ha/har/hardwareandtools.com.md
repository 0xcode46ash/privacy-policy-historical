HardwareAndTools.com is a unit of Hardware and Tools Corp. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing [webmaster@HardwareAndTools.com](mailto:webmaster@HardwareAndTools.com).

### Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

Our websites log IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that users sessions are tracked, but the users remain anonymous. You can browse our site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope that our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about our valuable customers. Our registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and some limited demographic information. We encourage all visitors to register but do allow for anonymous checkout.

We maintain a separate list of email addresses which are used to send our newsletters containing specials your fellow readers have asked us about. If you would rather not receive the newsletter(s), but would still like to register, you may register on site but opt out of our specials newsletter.

Preferences and demographic information are used to help us improve our service and products. The more we know about you, the better we can serve you. Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign In" and enter our contests, or request information. If so, we may on our own behalf send you Email with copies of our specials. (We will delete your Email address on request.)

The only place that we collect personal information on our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing information such as name, postal address, email address and credit card number should you decide to place an order.

Our Website logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the website.

### Checkout and Order Forms

The information that we require on our order form is only used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Your contact information is used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. This information may be used for marketing purposes only by us directly and by our affiliate DoItYourself.com. The contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. We do not sell or distribute telephone numbers, except to the carriers involved in delivering your packages and only to facilitate delivery. Users may always opt-out of receiving future emails.

### Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

For those visitors who register with us, we may share your name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with select partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as mentioned above, you may tell us that you don't want your information shared, in which case we will of course respect your wishes. The information that you submit on the order form (contact and billing information) is never shared with any third parties.

### Security

When you place an order online, your personal information and credit card information are scrambled using encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted behind a firewall until we're ready to process it. In addition, we erase most of your credit card information from our web site database so it is therefore safe from "hackers."

### Cookies

Our site uses cookies to keep track referrals and items in your shopping cart and wish list and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience. With the help of cookies, we can present customized content and ads that will be of more interest. We also use cookies to remember members passwords so they don't have to re-enter them each time they visit the site. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if certain cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't be able to keep items in your cart from visit to visit and you will have to reenter some information on every visit.

### Opt-out Policy, Correcting and Updating

If at any time after registering, you change your mind about receiving the newsletter or sharing your information with third parties, you may visit the site and unsubscribe automatically from the newsletter link on every content page. You may also use this feature to delete an old email address or add a new one.

### General Advice

Finally, although HardwareAndTools.com has a very strong Privacy Protection policy on our end, and do their utmost to protect privacy of all visitors, we bear no responsibility for anyone else's conduct with respect to material you transmit. As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone else has access to your computer, or spy ware is resident on your computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may be possible for that "someone else" or the "network" operator to retrieve copies of Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace the places you have been visiting on the Internet.

### Amendments

We may amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective basis (i.e., for future visits) at any time by posting a revised policy on our Web site. Further, nothing in this Privacy Policy is designed to protect the privacy of visitors whose use of the Company's Website is, in our opinion, or that of our attorneys or affiliates is intended for illegal, improper or abusive purposes, for purposes of marketing or solicitation, or would violate any other terms and conditions relating to use of the Web site.
