What types of information is the Harmony Central site collecting, and how is the site collecting it?

Many of the services and products on our sites are available for viewing without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can visit the Harmony Central Website and see much of our content anonymously.

Information You Provide

There are some activities on our sites where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like forum registration, or otherwise contacting us. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. Personally identifiable information may include contact data, such as your name, address, phone and e-mail address; financial data for purchases, such as your account or credit card number; and demographic data, such as your zip code, age and income.

Information Collected from You with Technology

Harmony Central collects some information about you using technology, so it may not be obvious to you that it is being collected. That information may include your IP address, your domain server, your type of computer, your type of web browser, and statistical information regarding the pages that you visit. Harmony Central uses information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. For example, statistical information can help us track which areas of a site are more popular, so that we can better customize content to the interests of our visitors. We will combine information collected using technology with personally identifiable information only to identify a visitor in order to protect our service, site, Guests or others, when required by law, or when needed to help resolve a technical issue a Guest may be having while viewing the site.

What Are Cookies, and How Does Harmony Central Use Them?

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. Harmony Central and other Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes, such as to customize content, or store log-in information if you so desire. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to some Harmony Central features that make your Web experience more efficient, and some services may not function properly.

How does Harmony Central use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?

Harmony Central uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, we use information collected to notify you if you've won a contest. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our site. And we use demographic data to customize and tailor your experience on our sites, displaying content that we think you might be interested in.

Does Harmony Central share information with companies or other organizations not a part of the Harmony Central network of sites?

You are one of the most valuable assets of our business. We aren't in the business of selling your information. However, if there is a value for our Guests, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another company. For example, if you buy a Harmony Central T-shirt, we need to share your information with any companies we hire to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping company. Or, if we offer a promotion--like sweepstakes or free subscriptions--in conjunction with a sponsor, we will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a magazine subscription or contest prize. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. In addition, Harmony Central may occasionally send e-mail promotions on behalf of third-party sponsors. In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party--we do the mailing for them. Again, we only send these promotions to you if you've given your permission by opting in to the newsletter. We may also share your information with our corporate affiliates.

Links to Other Outside Web Sites

Our Web sites may contain links to outside Web sites with which we do not have affiliation, partnership or other cooperative agreement. Harmony Central does not share your personal information with those Web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Guests and Our Sites

We will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site rules; or to protect the safety and security of Guests and our sites.

What choices do I have about Harmony Central collecting, using, and sharing my information?

It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information to limit e-mail communications from Harmony Central and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that Harmony Central not send future e-mail to you by unsubscribing by using the instructions included in each e-mail, or by filling out the remove form located here. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology--though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this. For the safety of minors, we request that children under the age of 18 not fill out any personal information on our Web sites without first receiving the approval of a parent or guardian.
