**Information Collection  
Visitors  
**In general, you can view our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track online usage, and gather broad information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Cookies  
**A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive that contains information about your computer. Cookies may also be used to enable us to track and target your interests, for the purpose of enhancing your experience on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still browse our site, however you will not be able to purchase or have access to all our services such as order history, address book, My Giftlist™, etc.

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to: <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>

To help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services available, we gather and analyze information about our customers (among other things, by using cookies).

**Product Orders/Catalog Requests  
**If you place an order or request a catalog from Harryanddavid.com, we require that you provide certain information on our online order form(s). For orders, we request you provide contact information (including your name, address, telephone number and email address, and the name and shipping address of the recipient) and financial information (including credit card number and expiration date and coupon code, if any). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

**Surveys and Contests  
**From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level, etc.). We will use contact information to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will assist us in improving our products and services, and in providing you with an enjoyable shopping experience. None of the information from a survey is used on an individual basis. All information is compiled into statistical groupings only and is not retained for any other use.

If you call or correspond with our customer service center, we will request information from you as well. The information requested depends upon the purpose of your contact, but is likely to include your name, billing address, email address, the name and shipping address of the recipient, financial information such as your credit card number and expiration date, and the order number and date.
