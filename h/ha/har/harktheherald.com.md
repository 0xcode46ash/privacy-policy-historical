# Daily Herald - Privacy Policy

## For Our News Site Readers

 **Your privacy matters!**  
heraldextra.com does not repackage, resell or share any personal information provided to us in the course of viewing our pages, ordering services or submitting content.

 **Children and the Web**  
Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. Further, we discourage children from sending us information without the express permission of a parent or guardian.

 **What are cookies?**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Heraldextra.com's advertising software sends a cookie to your computer to track advertisements so we can guarantee when and where they are placed. No private information from your computer is used for any other purpose.

 **Do not call policy**

This newspaper uses the telephone as one important way to stay in contact with our customers and our potential customers in the community. Because a good relationship with the community is a necessary ingredient of our success, and in keeping with state and federal laws, it is the policy of this newspaper that we will not make sales-related telephone calls to any person who has indicated a desire not to receive such calls. This includes those who have registered with state or federal "Do Not Call lists," as well as those who have previously told us directly that they do not wish to receive such calls.

The Daily Herald may at times offer subscription opportunities or solicit prospective customers by calling on private residences.

You may make a request to be added to our Do Not Call list in writing or by telephone. All requests should include your name, address and telephone number. Written requests should be mailed to the address listed above and directed to the attention of 'Do Not Call - Circulation Department'. Your telephone number will remain on our Do Not Call list for five years unless you specify otherwise. Of course, if your telephone number changes, you must give us your new number if you want your "Do Not Call" status to remain in effect.

Please keep in mind that regulations may permit the Daily Herald to contact you even if your telephone number is registered with your state or the national list. For instance, if you were a subscriber to the Daily Herald in the past 18 months, we may contact you to inform you of a subscription opportunity even if your telephone number is on the state or national "do not call" list. We like to remind customers as a service that their subscriptions are expiring and to offer special advertising opportunities to selected customers.
