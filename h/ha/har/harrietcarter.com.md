# Harriet Carter Privacy Statement

HarrietCarter.com has created this privacy statement because we believe you have a right to a safe, secure online shopping experience. We are committed both to protecting your privacy and informing you how information from you will be used. If you still have concerns or questions after reading this policy, please let us know. We'll do all we can to make you feel comfortable at HarrietCarter.com.

  **When I visit HarrietCarter.com, what information is gathered about me and why?**

 Harriet Carter does collect certain customer information. We use this information to process orders, enhance your shopping experience and communicate with our customers.

 We use order forms that allow you to buy our products. We collect your name, e-mail address, postal address, and credit card information. This information is used to process and send orders. We also use this information to contact you in case there is a question or problem with an order.

 When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may collect your name, e-mail address, and other demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. We use this contact information to send you information about our company and to contact you, if you indicate an interest.

 We also use data collected when you register, enter a contest, and make purchases to enhance and personalize your shopping experience. If you give us permission or place an order on HarrietCarter.com, we will send you email about our latest updates, product offerings and sales events. You can opt-out of these emails anytime by click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of every promotional email, or send an empty email to [customerservice@harrietcarter.com](mailto:customerservice@harrietcarter.com) with “unsubscribe” in the subject line.

 We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer this website. We log IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to track a user's specific client, or to investigate cases of fraud or other security violations on our site. Any personally identifiable information contained in our IP address logs will be treated with the same respect for your privacy that order and registration information is treated.

  **What Are Cookies and Should I Worry About Them?**

 Cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites use to make online navigation easier. This data is contained on your hard drive in a file, which your web browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID. Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to view our site, but you will need to accept cookies to register or place an order.

 Our site does use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to help make your shopping experience more enjoyable and if you choose to register with us or request to receive email, we will use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.

  **Who Else Has Access to the Information I Provide to HarrietCarter.com?**

 Once you make a purchase from HarrietCarter.com your name becomes a part of our customer file. As a valued Harriet Carter customer you may want to receive catalog mailings from us in the future. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an email to our Customer Service Department or send the mailing label from the back of your catalog and attach it to a piece of paper with your request. Mail this information to Mail Preference Service, Harriet Carter Gifts, Inc., 425 Stump Road, North Wales, PA 19454.

 You may also receive mailings from other carefully screened companies with whom we sometimes share our valued customer list. If you would prefer not to receive these mailings, please send an email to our Customer Service Department, or write us at: Mail Preference Service, Harriet Carter Gifts, Inc., 425 Stump Road, North Wales, PA 19454.

Harriet Carter does not sell or rent your email address.

 Another form of third party information that may be used is personally identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them. Other than that, HarrietCarter.com does not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to anyone. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to: 

1. comply with the law,   
2. enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or   
3. protect the rights, property, or safety of HarrietCarter.com and our users, or others.

When you complete the mailing address section on “My Account”…  
If you elect to have HarrietCarter.com retain frequent mailing addresses in our database,  these individual(s) are not considered Harriet Carter customers, and they will not be added to our catalog mailing list.

When you use the "Email-A-Friend" option...  
This unique feature allows you to share information about a particular item or wish list that you think may be interesting to another individual. We do not retain your friend’s name or email address, share their information with outside parties, nor does Harriet Carter contact them.   
If this individual purchases any of the items from HarrietCarter.com, whether these items appear on your wish list or not, this individual becomes a customer of Harriet Carter and we will include their name on the mailing list of customers for our catalog.

**How Do I Manage How Much Information I Share or if I Share Any At All?  
**    
You can opt out of receiving e-mail and other communications from us. Here's how: 

• You can send an email to: [customerservice@harrietcarter.com](mailto:customerservice@harrietcarter.com)   
• You can mail your request to the following postal address:  
Harriet Carter Gifts, Inc.  
425 Stump Rd  
North Wales, PA. 19454

When you create a “My Account” on HarrietCarter.com, the mailing information you provide is intended to make your checkout process easier. If you have a change of address, simply log on to your account on the website, and update your personal information. In order to change the address a catalog is mailed to, simply:

• Email: [customerservice@harrietcarter.com](mailto:customerservice@harrietcarter.com)  
• Mail: Harriet Carter Gifts, Inc., 425 Stump Rd, North Wales, PA. 19454

Please provide your old mailing address as well as your new mailing address.

Placing an order does not create an account. Creating an account does not automatically add your email address, unless you specifically request it, to the promotional email list. HarrietCarter.com adopts an “opt-in” mentality to all promotional information. When you place an order on HarrietCarter.com, you have opted in to our customer list, therefore you will receive promotional emails and future catalog mailings. Otherwise, you must specifically request promotional emails through the email sign-up box located on every page at HarrietCarter.com.

  **What is HarrietCarter.com Doing to Protect My Privacy?**

 This site has security measures in place to protect from the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control.

We routinely and zealously monitor and upgrade our security systems to ensure that we use the best security technology available.

 We at HarrietCarter.com are sincerely committed to a safe and secure web experience for our visitors.

 There are certain steps within a normal purchase routine that require the web servers to send an automated email to confirm that a process you requested has been completed. This includes, but is not limited to:

• Emailing your password after you have registered for an account  
• Emailing a confirmation of your order after your have clicked “submit”  
• Emailing information regarding status of a pending order.

These emails are not promotional in nature, they are necessary communications to assure you, our customer, that your order has been received and processed. If you prefer that these required emails are sent to a specific address (for example, you would prefer not to receive these at your place of business) use a personal email address when the forms on the site require one. This includes, but is not limited to:

• Username and password on “My Account” (we do not retain credit card information on “My Account”)  
• Return Email address on Customer Service Form  
• Requested email address on the checkout pages
