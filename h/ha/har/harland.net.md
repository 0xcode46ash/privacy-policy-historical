  * Information that we obtain from your transactions and dealings with us.  For example, your account, order and payment history.


  * Information that we obtain from third parties about your transactions and dealings with these third parties.  For example, your account, order and payment history with these third parties.


  * Also, we may collect Information about you that we obtain from consumer reporting agencies, such as your credit worthiness and credit history.



**Information we disclose about you**

We consolidate and share all of the information we collect, as described above, including information about former customers, with the companies and businesses that belong to the John H. Harland Company corporate family.
