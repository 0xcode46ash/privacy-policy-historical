We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies and with selected third parties including:

  * Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you, including fulfilling reservations and offering certain products and services in connection with our Site and the Resort.
  * Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.Â  We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
  * Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our Site.



We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
  * If HRHH or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use <https://www.hardrockhotel.com/terms-of-use> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of HRHH, our customers, the Resort, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



**_STORAGE AND SECURITY_**

The security of your personal information is important to us. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or secure services controlled by third parties on our behalf. Any payment transactions through the Site will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

**_COOKIES_**

Our website may use cookies or other tracking technologies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.

**_Children_**

The Site is not directed toward children under 13 years of age nor does HRHH knowingly collect information from children under 13.Â  If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to submit any personally identifiable information to HRHH.

**_YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES_**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.Â  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s) or text communications, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you or telephone number to send the text communications to you, as applicable. You may opt out of certain communications such as customer feedback or marketing emails or postal mail through the instructions in the email or text, as applicable, or by clicking [here](mailto:ContactUs@hrhvegas.com?subject=Unsubscribe%20&body=Please%20unsubscribe%20me%20from%20Hard%20Rock%20Hotel%20%26%20Casino%20Emails)Â or by contacting us as described in the "Contact Us" section below.

Some Browsers support a âDo Not Trackâ feature, which is intended to be a signal to websites that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites you visit. Certain legal obligations require that we disclose how websites we operate, such as our registration page, react to Do Not Track signals.

Unfortunately there is no common standard among browsers or advertisers on how to implement Do Not Track, and no common understanding of how websites and advertisers should react. Therefore, at this time we do not alter the behavior of the Site for visitors who have Do Not Track signals enabled.

Where provided under applicable law, you may have the right to ask us for a list of your personal data we share with third parties and information regarding those third parties, if the third parties use the personal data for their direct marketing purposes. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us as described in the "Contact Us" section below.

**_LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES_**

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.Â  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.Â  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

**_CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY_**

Any material changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page prior to the change becoming effective and notify you through the Site or, where appropriate, by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy. These changes will become effective upon obtaining your consent, if necessary, as required under local law. If you do not agree or consent to these updates or changes, do not continue to use the Site.

**_YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS_**

California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the address as provided below in the "Contact Us" section. In your request, please specify that you want a "California Privacy Rights Notice". Please allow 30 days for a response.
