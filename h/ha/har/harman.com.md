**US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**

Harman International Industries, Incorporated and our wholly-owned subsidiaries are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those who entrust us with their personal information. Our employees, and all those who do business with us, trust and expect that we will protect their personal information in accordance with the promises we make. In furtherance of our commitment, the following Harman entities have certified to the Safe Harbor Agreement between the United States and the European Union (“EU”), with respect to personal data processed as part of our human resources, research and development, customer service and account management activities:

• Harman International Industries, Incorporated  
• Crown Audio, Inc.  
• Harman Becker Automotive Systems, Inc.  
• Harman Consumer Group, Inc.  
• Harman Financial Group LLC  
• JBL Incorporated  
• Margi Systems, Inc.  
• QNX Software Systems, Inc.

Accordingly, Harman International Industries, Incorporated adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles and frequently asked questions, as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.

**Scope**

This Safe Harbor Statement sets forth the principles under which Harman manages the processing of personal data that we receive from our affiliates, subsidiaries and agents in the EU in support of our human resources, research and development, customer service and account management activities. The categories of personal data covered by this Statement include personal data relating to current and former Harman employees, prospective employees, temporary workers, contract workers, consultants, consumers, business partners, and individuals who report adverse events or product complaints. 

**Definitions**

The following terms are used throughout this document and are defined as follows:

_“Agent”_ means any third party that processes personal data under the instructions of, and solely for, Harman or to which Harman discloses personal data for use on our behalf. 

_“Harman”_ means Harman International Industries, Incorporated, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

_“Personal data”_ means any information or set of information in any form that (i) is transferred from the EU to the US, (ii) is recorded in any form, (iii) is about or relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, and (iv) can be linked to that natural person. Personal data does not include anonymized data or data that is reported in the aggregate.

_“Sensitive personal data”_ means personal data that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, any data that concerns health or sex life, or information relating to the commission of a criminal offense.

**Privacy Principles**

**Notice** : Harman notifies individuals about the types of personal data we collect about them, the purposes for which we collect such data, the types of third parties to which we disclose such data, and how to contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language at the time of collection, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and before Harman uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. 

**Choice** : In the event personal data is to be used for a new purpose incompatible with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or subsequently authorized or transferred to a third party exercising independent control over the data, individuals are given, where practicable and appropriate, an opportunity to decline to have their data so used or transferred. In the event that the data used for a new purpose or transferred to the control of a third party is sensitive personal data, the individual’s explicit consent will be obtained prior to the use or transfer of the data.

**Onward Transfers** : Harman will only transfer personal data to an Agent where the Agent has given assurances that they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these privacy principles. Where Harman has knowledge that an Agent is using or sharing personal data in a way that is contrary to these principles, Harman will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. Harman will only transfer personal data to a non-agent third party where individuals have been provided notice and have given their consent.

**Security** : Harman takes reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data, whether in electronic or tangible, hard copy form.

**Access** : Individuals have reasonable access to their personal data and may request corrections, deletions, or additions, as appropriate, and except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

**Data Integrity** : Harman limits the collection, usage, and retention of information to that which is germane for the intended purposes for which it was collected, and takes reasonable steps to ensure that all data is reliable, accurate, complete and current.

**Enforcement** : Harman has put in place mechanisms to verify ongoing compliance to these privacy principles. We conduct an annual self-assessment of our practices with respect to personal data to verify that representations we make about our personal data privacy practices are true and that related privacy policies have been implemented as represented. Any employee that violates these privacy principles will be subject to disciplinary procedures. 

**Dispute Resolution** : In case of disputes, individuals are able to seek resolution of their questions or complaints regarding use and disclosure of their personal data in accordance with the principles contained in this policy. If you feel that Harman is not abiding by this policy or is not in compliance with the Safe Harbor principles, you should first contact Harman at the contact information provided below. Harman has agreed to cooperate with the European Data Protection Authorities for the purpose of handling any unresolved complaints.

**Limitation on Scope of Principles**

Harman adheres to these privacy principles except, as required or allowed by law, to meet legal, governmental, law enforcement or national security obligations, or to protect the health or safety of an individual.
