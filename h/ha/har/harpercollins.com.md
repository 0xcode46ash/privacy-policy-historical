# Privacy Policy, HarperCollins Publishers

Effective as of March 9, 2006

HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C. ("HarperCollins") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. HarperCollins has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the United States both online and off-line. 

**Children's Privacy Policy**  
Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. When those activities involve the collection of PII, we provide additional privacy protections. To read about our protections that relate to the online collection of PII from children under 13 [click here](https://web.archive.org/footer/coppa.aspx).

From time to time HarperCollins may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our Web sites, or technology. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If HarperCollins materially changes its practices regarding the collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.

**COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY HARPERCOLLINS**

General. HarperCollins collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the HarperCollins Web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our Web sites more enjoyable.

If you have subscribed to be a "member" of HarperCollins and log on to one of our Web sites under your "password", we will employ cookies to identify you as a unique visitor. We also may use cookies in a variety of ways, such as allowing for easier logon and relating your use of our Web sites to non-personally identifiable information you have provided to us, so that we can limit the online ads we display to you to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

We may also use cookies or similar tools to relate your use of our Web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you ask us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on HarperCollins Web sites may allow us to limit the material we send you to the types of items we believe you will find interesting, based upon your activities on our sites and your preferences. However, if we wish to coordinate your personal and Web site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent. Also, our cookies will not contain PII.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.

**NOTICE: HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES**

When you voluntarily provide PII to HarperCollins, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information. 

At the time you provide your PII, HarperCollins will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information, provided you have given HarperCollins permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

HarperCollins's Web sites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a HarperCollins logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by HarperCollins, such as Web sites owned and operated by our authors. HarperCollins's Web sites may also carry advertisements from other companies. HarperCollins is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you've left a HarperCollins Web site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

HarperCollins's Web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with HarperCollins (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

**CHOICE: HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII**

HarperCollins will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with HarperCollins (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission. 

**USE: HARPERCOLLINS'S USE OF PII**

HarperCollins will use your PII provided under this Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If HarperCollins obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy.

HarperCollins may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, we may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with HarperCollins but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, HarperCollins may offer a sweepstakes or contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor that may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to HarperCollins customers. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those HarperCollins uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through HarperCollins's Web sites.

HarperCollins's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. HarperCollins may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide HarperCollins with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

HarperCollins may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows HarperCollins to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Web sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with HarperCollins's advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when HarperCollins may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of HarperCollins, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if HarperCollins sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, HarperCollins may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

**SECURITY: HARPERCOLLINS PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII**

HarperCollins uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, we use reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords and PII are stored by HarperCollins behind firewalls. Credit card information is encrypted both in transit and when stored within HarperCollins's online databases.

**ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, OR CORRECT YOUR PII OR STOP ALL FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS FROM HARPERCOLLINS**

HarperCollins has implemented a procedure for you to access, correct or delete your PII, and, if you are a member of HarperCollins, review your user preferences.

After reviewing the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you and provide a list of your PII on file.
