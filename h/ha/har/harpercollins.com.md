# HarperCollins.com: Privacy

**WELCOME TO HarperCollins!**

> HarperCollins Publishers Inc. ("HarperCollins") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. HarperCollins has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

**Children's Privacy Policy**  
Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. In those instances, we provide additional privacy protections. To read about our protections for children under 13 [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20011101093352id_/http://www.harpercollins.com/hc/privacy/coppa.asp).

From time to time HarperCollins may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

**COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY HARPERCOLLINS**  
General. HarperCollins collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the operators of Internet sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our web sites more enjoyable.

At this time, HarperCollins does not employ any cookies on its sites. In the future, we plan to use cookies in a variety of ways, including storing your password for easy logon and relating your use of our site to your PII, so that, if you ask us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, the cookie information will allow us to limit the material we send you to the types of items you had viewed on our site in the past. However, if we wish to coordinate personal and cookie information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in"). Also, our cookies will not contain PII. 

You can always program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.

**NOTICE: HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES**

When HarperCollins collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information. 

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, at the time your PII is collected, HarperCollins will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

HarperCollins's web sites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a HarperCollins logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by HarperCollins, such as web sites owned and operated by our authors. HarperCollins's web sites may also carry advertisements from other companies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, HarperCollins is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites or for the privacy practices of third parties that advertise on our web sites. Once you've left a HarperCollins web site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

HarperCollins's web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with HarperCollins. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

**CHOICE: HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII**

HarperCollins will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with HarperCollins (i.e., not part of the News America Group). 

**USE: HARPERCOLLINS'S USE OF PII**

HarperCollins will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your information in these other ways. 

HarperCollins may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies. We may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with HarperCollins but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, HarperCollins may offer a sweepstakes or contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor, and the co-sponsor may send you information concerning its products or services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties. 

HarperCollins's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide HarperCollins with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

If HarperCollins obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy. 

HarperCollins may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites. 

**SECURITY: HARPERCOLLINS PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII**

HarperCollins uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, we use reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. 

**ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII**

You may review or delete PII about you from our records at anytime. If you would like to know the types of information that HarperCollins collects from visitors to its web sites, please send your request to feedback@harpercollins.com or write to HarperCollins Publishers Inc., Attn: Veronica "Ronnie" Gambon, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022. If you would like to know whether HarperCollins has collected PII about you, please send us the activities that you participated in on our web sites which requested PII. After reviewing the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you. 

Prior to changing or deleting any information about you, HarperCollins requires that you provide proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license. Once we determine that the information provided is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify the information and/or and refrain from collecting PII about you in the future, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain PII. This residual information will not be given to any third party or used for any commercial purpose.
