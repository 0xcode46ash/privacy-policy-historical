**About hardCOREware.net - NO BS**

We are a hardware gaming review site.  We review the latest, greatest (and lamest, on occasion) hardware and games, and tell you about it.  We tell you **nothing** less than the **blatant and total truth**.  If something kicks ass, believe me, you will be the first to know.  The same goes if something sucks ass.

What makes us different from other hardware gaming sites? Well, the fact that we give you the straight, **no BS** story on hardware.  We're not going to slam every piece we review, but we aren't going to be like other sites who have nothing bad to say about anything, just so they can score free hardware.

We will have several reviews each week.  The hardware will range from the latest graphics cards and CPUs, right down to cases, fans, heatsinks, and mice.  Everything that is important to you, the hardcore gamer.

**hardCOREware is:**
