Carl Nelson (lowlight) has been a hardcore gamer from the get-go.  From copying code out of magazines and into his Vic-20 at the age of 5, to starting (and running, of course) several gaming web sites, he has seen just about everything.

Other sites include: [Surreal-News.com](http://www.surreal-news.com/) \- A site devoted to bringing you the latest news regarding Surreal Software, and ALL their titles.  Right now this includes Drakan: Order of the Flame.  You will find the most extensive database of player-created levels on Surreal-News, as well as the official DevBoard, where YOU suggest to Surreal what YOU want to see in games.  Surreal is a true software development company.
