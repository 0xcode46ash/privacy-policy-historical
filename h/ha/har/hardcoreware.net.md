# hardCOREware.net - About Us

hardCOREware.net was started in February 2000 by Carl Nelson in Vancouver BC, Canada. The intention was to provide in-depth reviews on PC hardware and accessories without the pandering to hardware companies often seen on 'hobby sites' of the time. HCW became known for their tough view on PC hardware, and no-punches-pulled attitude.

HCW has grown a lot over the years. Originally, we would mostly cover cooling products along with some hardware. Today we focus mostly on the hardware that matters to you most; motherboards, processors, video cards, memory, etc. At the same time, we still cover the stuff we think you should know about; new cases, power supplies, and other quirky products that may grab our attention. We also attend the major PC trade shows, such as CES and Computex, as well as bringing you information from factories tours all over the world.

**Quick Facts:**

  * HCW runs on a Dell PowerEdge 850 with a Pentium Extreme 3.73 GHz CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 2 Raptor 74 GB Hard Drives.
