## OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

We may gather and store aggregate information about visitors. The collection of this aggregate information enables us to measure the number of visitors to various portions of the Site, diagnose problems with our server, administer the Site and track visitor activity. We will use this aggregate information to learn more about what you and our customers are expecting from our services, and tailor and improve the Site. Because aggregate information collected on the Site does not personally identify you, we may use aggregate information for any purpose whatsoever, and share aggregate information with third parties for any purpose whatsoever. Below are ways we may collect this aggregate information:

  * HTTP cookies, flash cookies, or other similar technologies.
  * Pixel-tags also known as web beacons or clear GIF's or similar means. The data collected includes such anonymous information as what operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our Site, how long you stay on our web pages, and when you open emails from us.
  * Internet Protocol address which is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting Internet Protocol addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.



We also use service providers to help us develop applications for your convenience, such as to submit a claim through your mobile device. These application service providers may use tracking pixels, agents or other visitor identification technology to collect certain non-personal information, such as your browser type, your operating system, and other information that does not identify you. The application service providers do not receive your claims information or any other information that identifies you.

We and the third parties we partner with currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our websites or use our services.

## OUR SECURITY PROCEDURES

We take reasonable precautions to safeguard the personal information transmitted between visitors and the Site and the personal information stored on our servers. Unfortunately, no method of transmitting or storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us through, or in connection with, the Site. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at The Hartford - Privacy Office (Law-B1E), 200 Hopmeadow Street, Simsbury, CT 06070. In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.

If you receive an email or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or social security number) via email or to a website that does not seem to be affiliated with the Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information. Report such requests to us at The Hartford - Privacy Office (Law-B1E), 200 Hopmeadow Street, Simsbury, CT 06070.
