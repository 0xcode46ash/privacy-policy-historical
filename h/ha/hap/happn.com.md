Updated on: 05/25/2018

### **1\. Processing manager**

The data collected is processed by SAS HAPPN with a capital of 36 486,44€ registered under the number 535 217 723 at the Paris RCS. Its headquarters are located at 8 rue du Sentier 75002 Paris, France, and the company is represented by its CEO, Mr. Didier Rappaport. 

HAPPN is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of your privacy. This privacy policy (along with our document on the use of cookies and our terms of service and any other document that references it) is meant to inform you on the way we process the personal data you share with us and that we collect when you use the Application and Services. We invite you to carefully read this document to better understand how we process your personal data, and to know your rights. 

This Privacy Policy is applicable to all Services created by HAPPN that you use (with the exception of services supplied and operated by third parties, in which case, their privacy policy applies). 

### **2\. The information we collect**

Your use of our Services makes it likely that we collect and process data necessary to the proper functioning of the Application and to the supply of the Services. It can be information you share with us directly, or data we collect automatically. 

**2.1 Data you share directly  **

When you use our Services, you are required to share some information, some of which may serve to identify you. When you communicate this information, you accept that some of it will be visible to the other Members of the Application, and therefore be made public on the Application. In an effort to help you identify this information easily, it is signaled as “public” below. HAPPN cannot be held liable for data published on its platform and disclosed by a Member. However, the information not marked as Public will not be visible or accessible by other Members. 

The information you share contains the following data: 

**Registration data:** this is the basic data that is necessary for you to register and access our Services. This data is collected by HAPPN from Facebook, via Facebook Connect, to simplify the process. When you click on “Facebook Connect”, you let Facebook share this data with us. This identity data is: 

  * Your photo (public): this is, at least, your public Facebook profile picture. You then have the option of removing this photo and/or adding other photos to your Account from your Facebook account or smartphone.
  * Your birthdate (private): only your age, as deduced from the birthday, will be visible to other members. You can also hide your age by subscribing to an option. 
  * Your gender (public)  
  * Your first name (public)
  * Your last name (private)



Sharing this information is mandatory. If you do not share it, happn will not be able to supply the Services offered in the Application and you will not be able to create an account. 

You may add additional information to improve your Profile. This information is optional, shared at your own discretion, and is your sole responsibility. You can add this information directly to your Profile on the Application and/or via Facebook Connect by synching your Account with Facebook. This data is: 

  * Information on your career (public) like your job or education. 
  * Your interests (public) like your personal preferences, hobbies, Facebook friends list allowing you to see possible friends in common on the Application. 
  * Your e-mail address (private). The Member commits to making sure the address collected from Facebook Connect is valid and/or to modify it to ease communications with HAPPN.
  * Your mobile phone number (private)
  * Your profile description (public): If you would like to, you can share additional information about you in the space provided for this purpose. This information will be visible to HAPPN Members. HAPPN does not encourage Members to share data that can be perceived as sensitive with other Member, or with HAPPN through the Application. Sensitive data refers to data that is legally qualified as “sensitive” by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). More specifically, it includes information on race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation with a union, along with information on health, sexual life or sexual preferences (“Sensitive Data”). If a Member decides to share such information on his/her profile regardless, it is deemed to have been “clearly made public” by the Member who shared it, according to the GDPR. 



**Data on your interactions with HAPPN** : we may ask you to share, or you may be in a situation where you need to give us information, for example when you contact our customer or support services, report an issue with our services, ask for help, exercise your personal data rights, or participate in a promo, game, contest, raffle, or survey, when you share your experience with our services, give testimonies, or answer one of our questionnaires. 

**2.2  ** **Data we collect automatically**

When you use our services and features, we collect information regarding your activity on the Application: 

**Activity data** : when you access our Services and use the Application and its features, data on the way you use them may be collected and processed. More specifically, this includes your registration date, last connection, the type and number of interactions with other Members (like the “Hi”, Likes, crossings, and Crushes), with the third-party accounts connected to your Account (like Spotify, Instagram), or the number of transactions performed (purchasing credits or subscription(s)). 

**Location Data (geolocation):** the Application’s main value and purpose is to allow Members to find other Members they have crossed paths with to facilitate virtual and/or real life meet ups. You will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your location data to allow HAPPN to identify your crossing points with other Members who agreed to be geolocated. The crossing points let HAPPN show you profiles of Members you have crossed paths with and who meet your search criteria. These crossing points can be displayed as a newsfeed or as a map. 

HAPPN can, if you deliberately agree, access your position, approximatively or more precisely depending on the technology you use. HAPPN does not recreate the movements and/or itineraries of its Members, and would like to remind you that it only keeps crossing locations between Members. The exact position or the itinerary of a Member is never available to the other Members.

You are free to withdraw your consent at any time and disable your smartphone’s geolocation option. If you choose to do so, your newsfeed will no longer be updated, and your will not be able see who you have crossed paths with after disabling the geolocation option. 

**Transaction Data:** HAPPN does not collect or process any bank data. Apple’s App Store, Google’s Play Store and Microsoft’s Windows Phone Store have opted to refrain from sending certain types data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial information. This data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and HAPPN does not have the option of changing this payment method. The only information exchanged between HAPPN and Apple’s App Store, Google’s Play Store, or Microsoft’s Windows Phone Store is technical data that doesn’t allow us to identify you (for example, a transaction number), which serves to confirm transactions. 

**Data on the use of the messaging service:** sent messages are stored on HAPPN’s servers exclusively, to provide the Service to allow Members having a Crush to have a conversation. Messages and voice notes are strictly private and only implicate the Members involved. HAPPN’s authorized managers do not hold or exercise any rights to view these conversations, except in cases of judicial request, and/or in compliance with legislative or administrative dispositions. Additionally, Messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Members not involved in the conversation, nor to any third party. 

**Search preferences data:** The Application lets you set search preferences for age and gender. You can change these settings in the Application and specify the age range and, after agreeing to HAPPN collecting and processing your data, the gender of people you are looking for, so you can be matched exclusively with profiles you crossed paths with and who meet your search criteria. You will then only see the Members you’ve crossed paths with and who share your search preferences on your newsfeed. 

**Device and equipment data:** we collect information from the devices and equipment you use to access our Services, including server logs, which may contain information like IP addresses, version of the application, mobile model, mobile ID, language used, operating system, application crashes, and advertisement ID. HAPPN cannot access its Members’ browser history. Data may be collected with cookies: to learn more about this, please see our document on the Use of Cookies. 

### **3\. How we use the data collected**

The data collected by HAPPN allows us to provide the Services and make sure the Application is running smoothly, which it is contractually obligated to do, in virtue of the contract biding us with the Members (Terms of Service). Your data is therefore processed for the following purposes:

As the data processing relies on the consent of Members to have their data processed, they can withdraw it at any time; withdrawal of the consent does not affect processing carried out before the withdrawal. 

HAPPN may process Members’ personal data in response to a legal request (search warrant, court order, or the like) or to comply with its legal, regulatory, judicial, or administrative obligations. 

Lastly, HAPPN can process your personal data to uncover or prevent fraudulent activities or breaches to the Service’s safety, in compliance with the law, or analyze reports of Members displaying a behavior breaching the Terms of Service.

HAPPN may also enter into agreements with authenticated and reliable service providers and partners, who may access and/or process Members’ personal data, in compliance with the Privacy Policy, and while ensuring the safety and privacy of the Members’ personal data. These service providers and partners help us run and improve our Services, especially with regards to data hosting, surveys, analyses and statistics, the use and/or proper functioning of the Application, and providing the necessary assistance to Members, marketing and advertisement to send offers, messages, and relevant content to HAPPN Members.
