# Haptik - Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

##### A. GENERAL

1.1 Haptik is committed to the protection of personal information provided by the users to us. You agree that your use of Haptik’s mobile application (the “Application”), owned by Haptik Inc (the “Company”), implies your consent to the collection and use of your personal information (or your children's personal information) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

1.2 We at Haptik take the privacy of its users seriously. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users while providing a personalised and valuable service.

When a user uses the Application, Haptik may collect users’ mobile phone number, mailing address, email ID, Pin Code, other apps on users’ phones, login information for Facebook, Twitter and Google account and other personal information such as service Account Numbers. A high standard of security is maintained by Haptik for its users; however the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect user information, particularly with respect to protection of personal data, we cannot ensure the security of user data transmitted to us via the internet or any other medium

##### B. INFORMATION COLLECTED

2.1 We collect personal information from you at registration and other times (for instance, when you download the Application) such as [your name, your picture, email address, postal address, mobile phone number, a list of all apps on your phone].

2.2 You are under no obligation to provide us with such information. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to use the Application and we may not be able to respond effectively to your query or provide you with certain services.

##### C. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

3.1 We do not disclose your information to any third parties other than Haptik’s affiliates.   
3.2 We also use information in aggregate form (so that no individual user is identified):

(i) to build up marketing profiles;  
(ii) to aid strategic development ;  
(iii) to manage our relationship with advertisers and partners; and  
(iv) to audit usage of the Application.

3.3 Haptik reserves the right to disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that it is necessary to do so to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of Haptik, the Application, or its users. 

##### D. YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS POLICY

4.1 By using this Application, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Haptik and to this Privacy Policy. If we change the Privacy Policy then we will post these changes on this page.

4.2 Whilst we use all reasonable endeavours to protect your security in the manner described above, we consider that it is only appropriate to advise users that data transmission over the internet, the world wide web or any other type of network cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure and therefore that you use the Application at your own risk.

##### E. YOUR RIGHTS

5.1 You have a legal right to a copy of any personal information about you held by us. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to request that we cease to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
