##  Haggle Privacy Policy

Effective March 23, 2010

###  What This Privacy Policy Covers

  * This policy covers how Haggle LLC ("Haggle," "we" or "us") treats personal information that Haggle collects and receives from you in connection with your use of its web site at [www.haggle.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"), your use or access of the Haggle auction service that may be accessed through other Web sites (the "Auction"), and the download, installation, access to and use of all or any part of the Haggle Toolbar software and any third party software or any portion thereof provided in conjunction with the Haggle Toolbar (collectively the "Software").
  * As used in the policy, "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about an individual or that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site or the Auction, when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or the Auction or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Haggle does not own or control, or to people that Haggle does not employ or manage. Our Site may contain links to other Web sites. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of web sites to which we link. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with any personal information.



###  Information Collection

Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site or participate in the Auction. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example: 

  * Haggle may collect personal information when you register with Haggle, when you make a bid, or when you purchase bids or items. Haggle may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
  * When you register or make a purchase, we collect information such as your name and email address, and you are not anonymous to us.
  * Haggleâ€™s third party payment processing provider collects credit card and other personal information when you make purchases.
  * Haggle may also collect demographic information and information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.
  * From time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.
  * If you participate Haggle-sponsored pages or events on third-party websites (such as a social networking site), we may collect personal information you submit in connection with such participation.



When you use the Site or participate in an Auction, some information is also automatically collected. For example: 

  * Haggle may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring Web site, and your activity on the Site.
  * We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the Site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information.
  * We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site. These third parties may place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services.



###  Use of Personal Information by Haggle

In either case, this Policy governs this information.
