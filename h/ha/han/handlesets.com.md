By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * Information You Give Us
    * We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way with the exception of your credit card numbers. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you.
  * Automatic Information
    * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our site. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at our site if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.



Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as the storage of items in your Shopping Cart. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, if you disable cookies, you will not be able to purchase from the our web site. We recommend that you leave them turned on.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 

If you choose to visit our site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about our privacy policies, please send us a thorough description to [customer Service](mailto:customerservice@handlesets.com) and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
