# Privacy - Comic Relief

**Privacy Policy**

Welcome to www.comicrelief.org ( the “Website”) operated by or on behalf of Comic Relief, Inc. (AGB), a nonprofit Delaware corporation located at 488 Madison Avenue, 10th Floor, (between 51st & 52nd Streets), New York, New York 10022 (“CRInc”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). This privacy policy is intended to inform you about how your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information is collected and used by us in operating the Website.

**How does the Website work?**

The Website offers visitors (“you” or “your”) the opportunity to browse the Website and use certain features on the Website. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by CRINC as described herein. CRINC reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website at any time. Our privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.

**What type of Personal Information do we collect from you and how do we use it?**

CRINC does not require you to provide us with any Personal Information in order to use the Website. Unless you provide Personal Information to us, we will not collect any Personal Information from you. However, in order to sign up for updates about CRINC, or to make a donation to us, you will need to provide certain Personal Information to us.

If you make a donation to us, the Personal Information you provide may include without limitation your name, address, email address and credit card and billing information, which we or an authorized third party on our behalf will collect and/or use to process your donation and issue a tax receipt to you. If you request to receive email updates, you will need to provide us with your email address, which we will use to provide you with such information.

In order to enable you to make donations and receive updates, we will share your Personal Information with (a) third parties authorized to act on our behalf, including, without limitation, credit card processing, banking and other service providers and (b) as applicable, other charitable organizations associated with your donation. If you elect to make a donation to CRINC through other websites, information you provide to authorized third parties on our behalf will be subject to the policies and procedures of such third parties, over which CRINC has no control.

Other than the third parties set forth herein, we will not sell, hire or release your Personal Information to any other third parties, unless we believe the release of such information is necessary (i) to comply with the law (e.g. a legal process or a statutory authorization), (ii) to protect or enforce our rights, or (iii) as part of a reorganization, consolidation, merger, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of CRINC.

**How is Personal Information protected?**

We care about the safety and security of your transactions. We select our service providers on the basis that they use industry-standard security protocols for protecting the confidentiality of the Personal Information that they handle for us, including without limitation using SSL encryption for credit card transactions. We do not authorize our service providers to use your Personal Information for purposes other than to execute transactions requested by you and to provide related services to us. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, please keep in mind that while we take the foregoing actions to protect Personal Information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

**What other information does Comic Relief collect?**

We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow a website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such non-Personal Information for promotional purposes.

If you do not want us to track such non-Personal Information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. Please keep in mind that if you make such adjustments, you may not be able to make a donation through the Website.

**Does Comic Relief provide links to other websites?**

CRINC may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we do not control unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your Personal Information and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this privacy policy.

**Do Not Track Signals**

Some web browsers have settings that include “do not track signals.” Our services are not currently engineered to respond to those signals from browsers.

**What are our policies regarding children?**

CRINC does not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age.

**Changes**

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).  
Do we have a mechanism to address questions and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?

**Personal Information Processing Outside of the United States**  
As part of the administration of the services, CRINC may enlist the aid of authorized third parties outside of the United States. Information collected under this privacy policy may be stored and processed outside of the United States, including without limitation in the United Kingdom.
