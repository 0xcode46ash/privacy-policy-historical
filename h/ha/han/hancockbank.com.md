# Hancock Bank Online

At Hancock Bank, we take the issue of privacy very seriously. We want to assure visitors to our Web site the security, privacy and confidentiality that they expect from a premier financial services institution. You can be sure that our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the principles and online guidelines described below. 

**Information Collected General**  
Hancock Bank does not collect any personal information from anyone who is merely visiting or browsing its Web site. Personal information may be requested if the visitor chooses to respond to online surveys, send Hancock Bank an e-mail message, apply for products and services online, or use Hancock Bank's on-line banking product. 

**E-mail and Product Inquiry**  
Through use of a "Contact Us" feedback form, Hancock Bank invites visitors on its Web sites to send e-mail messages to Hancock Bank so that Hancock Bank may respond to inquiries regarding Hancock Bank or its products or services. Hancock Bank retains copies of these e-mail messages. The information provided by a visitor will only be used to respond to the visitor's inquiry and to provide better customer service. If Hancock Bank thinks that a particular Hancock Bank account or service might apply to you or serve your needs, then Hancock Bank may occasionally contact you at your e-mail address to inform you of the potential benefits and availability of such accounts or services. Unless otherwise stated, all e-mail inquiries initiated from Hancock Bank’s web site by the user are assumed to be non-secured and therefore may be transmitted in the “open” over the Internet. 

**Applications for Products and Services**  
Through its Web site, Hancock Bank offers opportunities to apply for various products and services online, such as PC banking and brokerage services. Visitors who choose to apply for such products and services provide personal information Hancock Bank needs to process the application. To protect the confidentiality of the information submitted, Hancock Bank uses secure socket layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology establishes a "secure" Internet session and encodes the data submitted to the Hancock Bank Web site, ensuring that the information is accessible only to an authorized Hancock Bank representative and the customer. To support SSL, customers must have an Internet browser that supports state-of-the-art 128-bit "strong" encryption, such as Netscape 2.0 and higher, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and higher, and AOL 3.0 (Windows). A customer can tell whether a document comes from a secure server by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. After you have submitted an application online, Hancock Bank recommends that you end your browser session before leaving your computer. 

**Protecting Your Bank Online  
**When you bank online with Hancock Bank, we, along with our third-party service providers who bring these services to you, have access to your information. Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate third-party service provider, depending upon what is required to serve your needs. We use state-of-the-art Internet technology, supported by the third-party service providers that we work with, to make online banking secure and to protect your personal information. We also require an I.D. and password to access your accounts. If you do not provide this information, we cannot establish an online banking service for you. You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your ID or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off. 

**Planning Tools Do Not Capture Personal Data  
**There are many planning tools throughout this Site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home. We encourage you to try all of our "what-if" scenarios as often as you like. When you use various planning tools on our Site, the calculations run on your computer or our server. We do not capture the personal information that you provide using these planning tools. 

**Applications for Employment**  
Hancock Bank offers visitors to its Web site the opportunity to inquire about employment opportunities posted on the Web site. When enabled, applicants may also submit online resumes on the Web site. The information submitted is used solely to evaluate prospective candidates and to communicate regarding an open position. 

**Transactional Services**  
Within its web-site, Hancock Bank collects personal information necessary to complete transactions or provide data requested by the visitor (for example, account balances and check clearance dates).
