**WEB SITE POLICY NOTICE**

At Hancock Bank, we take the issue of privacy very seriously. We want to assure visitors to our Web site the security, privacy and confidentiality that they expect from a premier financial services institution. You can be sure that our commitment to protect your financial information will continue under the principles and online guidelines described below. 

**Information Collected Generally**  
Hancock Bank does not collect any personal information from anyone who is merely visiting or browsing its Web site. Personal information may be requested if the visitor chooses to respond to online surveys, sends Hancock Bank an e-mail message, applies for products and services online, or uses Hancock Bank's e-Banking Services. 

**E-mail and Product Inquiry**  
Through use of a "Contact Us" feedback form, Hancock Bank invites visitors on its Web sites to send e-mail messages to Hancock Bank so that Hancock Bank may respond to inquiries regarding Hancock Bank or its products or services. Hancock Bank retains copies of these e-mail messages. The information provided by a visitor will only be used to respond to the visitor's inquiry and to provide better customer service. If Hancock Bank thinks that a particular Hancock Bank account or service might apply to you or serve your needs, then Hancock Bank may occasionally contact you at your e-mail address to inform you of the potential benefits and availability of such accounts or services. Unless otherwise stated, all e-mail inquiries initiated from Hancock Banks web site by the user are assumed to be non-secured and therefore may be transmitted in the "open" over the Internet. 

**Applications for Products and Services**  
Through its Web site, Hancock Bank offers opportunities to apply for various products and services online, such as PC banking and brokerage services. Visitors who choose to apply for such products and services provide personal information Hancock Bank needs to process the application. To protect the confidentiality of the information submitted, Hancock Bank uses secure socket layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology establishes a "secure" Internet session and encodes the data submitted to the Hancock Bank Web site, ensuring that the information is accessible only to an authorized Hancock Bank representative and the customer. To support SSL, customers must have an Internet browser that supports state-of-the-art 128-bit "strong" encryption, such as Netscape 6.1 and higher, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6.0 and higher, and AOL 3.0 (Windows). A customer can tell whether a document comes from a secure server by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. After you have submitted an application online, Hancock Bank recommends that you end your browser session before leaving your computer. 

** Protecting Your Bank Online  
**When you bank online with Hancock Bank, we, along with our third-party service providers who bring these services to you, have access to your information. Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate third-party service provider, depending upon what is required to serve your needs. We use state-of-the-art Internet technology, supported by the third-party service providers that we work with, to make e-Banking secure and to protect your personal information. We also require an I.D. and password to access your accounts. If you do not provide this information, we cannot establish an e-Banking service for you. You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your ID or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off. 

** Planning Tools and Personal Data  
**There are many planning tools and educational topics throughout this Site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home. We encourage you to try all of our "what-if" scenarios as often as you like. When you use various planning tools on our Site, the calculations run on your computer or our server. The information you enter is retained to assist you on return visits to our site as it relates to the use of the tools and topics. The information is also used to present specific product/service information related to those tools or topics when visiting our web-site. You will not be solicited by telephone or e-mail unless you specifically request to have a representative contact you.
