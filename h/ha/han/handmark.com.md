**Privacy Policy**

**Handmark, Inc. (handmark.com) Privacy Notice**

Handmark, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting handmark.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

**What personal information about customers does Handmark, Inc. gather?**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and improve your online experience at handmark.com. Here are the types of information we gather: 

  * **Information You Give Us** \- We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, improving our shopping and other online experiences, and communicating with you. 
  * **Automatic Information** \- We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses handmark.com. 
  * **Information From Other Sources** \- For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. 



**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Handmark's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 



**Does Handmark, Inc. Share the Information It Receives?**   
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below. 

  * **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control** \- Occasionally we may make offers that are fulfilled through a business other than Handmark, Inc. You can tell when another business is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that business. 
  * **Agents** \- We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Promotional Offers** \- Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Handmark, Inc. customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. 
  * **Business Transfers** \- As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy products, services or other assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Handmark, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Handmark, Inc. and Others** \- We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Handmark, Inc., our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
  * **With Your Consent** \- Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 



**Children**  
handmark.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use handmark.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
