**THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS** govern use of your name, email address, payment information, and similar personal information that you may provide to e-Standard, Inc. ("e-Standard", "us", or "we") in the course of using this Web site, its products or services. By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by e-Standard, Inc. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION:** In the course of obtaining information about service providers, obtaining a referral to a service provider and using other services provided by this Web site ("transactions"), you may have the opportunity to voluntarily submit personal information that identifies you, for example, in filling out a personal profile or in the course of conducting a transaction. e-Standard maintains this information in a database.

**USE OF INFORMATION:** The primary purpose of maintaining this information is to complete transactions with you, to inform you about other services available through e-Standard, and about new services offered to you by e-Standard. e-Standard may offer this information to third parties that offer other products or services that e-Standard believes will interest you. e-Standard may also use this information to personalize your site experience by using your selections to shape recommendations about service providers that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store.

We may use "cookies" to process your transactions. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features and to store information about your transactions between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them.

We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to using the procedure below. Also, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Under no circumstances will e-Standard disclose information that is not reasonably needed by such third parties.

**SECURITY:** e-Standard carefully selects such third parties, is sensitive to the privacy and security of your personal information, and intends to safeguard such information. However, e-Standard and any such third party cannot guarantee absolute security for such information. Such information may be transmitted through or using the Internet, other public telecommunications networks, servers, hardware and software ("systems") that are not owned, operated, or controlled by e-Standard, and e-Standard makes no assurances that such information will remain private when transmitted by e-Standard through such systems.

**REQUESTING NO RELEASES:** If you prefer for e-Standard not to provide your personal information to such third parties, you may request e-Standard not to release such information.
