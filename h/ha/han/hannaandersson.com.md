**How does Hanna ensure my information is secure?**  
The security of your personal information is very important to Hanna, and we have implemented measures to ensure your information is processed confidentially, accurately, and securely. Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your order information, such as your name, address, and credit card number, during data transmission. Once you begin the checkout process you will be in secure mode and should see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the bottom of your Internet browser window. In addition, the beginning of the Hanna URL address at the top of your browser should change from “http” to “https”; the “s” standing for secure.

The Hanna website also displays the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that the site has been authenticated by VeriSign and that confidential transactions with our site are secured by SSL encryption.

Our customer service center and stores also operate over a private, secure network.
