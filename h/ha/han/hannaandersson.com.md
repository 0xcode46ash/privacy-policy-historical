At Hanna, we are committed to your security and privacy. We want to make your visit to our site enjoyable, informative, convenient and secure. To accomplish this, we collect certain customer information that permits us to enhance your online shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. We want to assure you that your personal information is managed responsibly.What this Policy Covers  
This policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. A link to this notice is available on our home page, and also anytime we request personally identifiable information. The policy applies only to the information that we at Hanna Andersson collect on our Web site.The Information We Collect   
We recognize and collect only the e-mail addresses of visitors who volunteer this information, and we do collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. These addresses are for e-mail correspondence only, and are not shared with outside parties. The addresses are shared only in accordance with the policies stated in the How We Share section, below. If you prefer not to receive information from Hanna Andersson through e-mail, postal mail or by telephone, please let us know by [clicking here](http://www.hannaandersson.com/email.asp), or by calling us at 1.800.222.0544. 

We also collect information on pages that customers access, and any information volunteered by customers, such as name, address and credit card information. We request this information when you place an order with us online, or request a catalog. Your credit card is not required to receive a catalog. To prevent unauthorized access, and to maintain data accuracy, as well as ensuring the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We also collect information that customers provide to Hanna Andersson about other customers. This occurs when a customer requests a catalog for a friend or sends a gift. To complete the request we need the friend's name, address and telephone number. We use the information provided only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. This information is not shared with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the order. 

Customers may review or update the personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain it at any time by calling us at 

1.800.222.0544 or visiting the online registration area on the Web site. When a customer calls or accesses our online registration, we will verify the customer identity before granting access to customer information. How We Use Information

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

Cookies

Cookies allow hannaAndersson.com to make our site more responsive to customer needs by offering a more personalized experience.

Coremetrics places cookies on your computer to collect information for Hanna to give us better knowledge about things like your navigation at our site, customer visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information. Important Note: hannaAndersson.com does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information.

The information and analysis is used only to help us better understand your interest in our Web site, and how to improve our service.

Security  
Whether you are shopping online, from our catalog or in our stores, we have security measures in place and take reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. Because the security of your personal information is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure that it is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. Our website uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address and credit card number. Our customer service center and stores also operate over a private, secure network. 

Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information. 

Here's how the Secure Server works:  
1\. Starting your order. Every order at www.hannaAndersson.com is secure. All data submitted via the checkout form is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.

2\. Making a Positive ID. After you've selected items to purchase, you'll be prompted to continue your order by clicking on "Check Out". At this point, your browser looks for a "site certificate" to confirm that it is communicating with www.hannaAndersson.com. Once a positive ID is made, your order continues.

3\. Entering "Secure Mode". At this point, your computer and our server begin communicating in secure mode, sending data back and forth in an encrypted format. We are now ready to ask you for your credit card information. The encryption features of browser software are exceptionally powerful and ensure the security of this data as it is transmitted to our server.

4\. Once your order information is received it is retrieved only by Hanna Andersson staff. How can you tell if you are in Secure Mode? The standard, unsecured URL address begins "http://". When you enter secure mode, the beginning of the URL address will change to "https://"; the "s" stands for secure. Most browsers in secure mode also display a blue line along the top of the browser window. Netscape Navigator (versions 3.0 and earlier) display a broken key symbol in the lower left corner of your browser window when you are not viewing a secure page of a site. This key will become solid when you enter secure mode. Netscape Communicator 4.0 uses a padlock, in the same location as the key, to indicate if you are in standard or secure mode. The padlock is open in standard mode and closed in secure mode. In Microsoft's Internet Explorer, you'll see a padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window when the browser is in secure mode. 

The account information of Hanna Andersson customers is password-protected for privacy and security. Hanna Andersson never asks customers for their passwords in unsolicited phone calls or e-mails. Customers are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their passwords and account information. Customers should always sign out of their Hanna Andersson account and close the browser window after shopping to help ensure that others cannot access personal information.

If you are still uncomfortable with submitting your personal information via the Internet for any reason, please feel free to call us at 

1.800.222.0544 8am to 12 midnight ET to place your order. We can also receive your order by fax at 1-503-321-5289 (U.S., Canada, and International orders) or at 00531-13-0663 (Japan). 

If at any time a customer believes the security of their account information has been compromised, we urge them to contact the Hanna Andersson Customer Service Team immediately at 

1.800.222.0544 or change the account information online. 

If a customer discovers unauthorized use of their credit card or debit card, the customer should notify their card provider immediately.

Hanna Andersson reserves the right to change, modify or amend this policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes to this policy, we will post those changes on this page. Hanna Andersson encourages customers to periodically review this policy to stay informed of how we collect, use and protect customer information.How to Update My Account Information  
Customers may access their information online by clicking "My Account," signing in, and then changing the appropriate information and clicking "Update My Account."How to Remove My Information from Hanna Andersson's Mailing Lists

If a customer asks Hanna Andersson to remove their name and address form our e-mail or postal mailing lists, we maintain that name in a "Do Not Mail" file to ensure that we will honor that request. Important Note: Because we plan mailings in advance, such requests may take from six to eight weeks to become effective.
