# Haband About Haband Privacy Policy

  
Haband Company and its subsidiary, Haband Online, are committed to respecting the privacy of our customers and all visitors to the Haband web site. We track non-specific statistical information about visitors arriving at our site such as the time of day they visit, which search engine they use and which web site referred you to us. We do not make any attempt to identify visitors by name or e-mail address. If you make a purchase at our site, we request only enough personal information for us to process and deliver your order. Here is how we handle the personal information that you provide us:

1\. E-mail address. When you place an order, or contact us for any reason at the Haband web site, you provide an e-mail address. The primary reason for this is so that our customer service department can respond to your inquiry or contact you with any questions they might have about your order. We will, from time to time, contact you via e-mail to let you know about new and interesting merchandise and special discount offers available at the Haband web site. If you would rather we not contact you with this information via e-mail, please send an e-mail to [remove_name@haband.net](mailto:remove_name@haband.net) (there is an underscore “_” between “remove” and “name”). Please mail the request from the e-mail address you wish to be excluded from such mailings.

Haband does not rent our customer e-mail addresses, nor do we share them with or sell them to any third party.

2\. Telephone Number. We ask for your phone number when you place an order at our web site. We will only call you if we need information to fill your order. We will not make a sales call to you.

3\. Credit Card Number. When you place an order at the Haband web site, we ask for your credit card information. Since our site is secure, no third party can intercept this information. We do not transfer or disclose our customer credit card information to any third party except in the single exception below.

* There is a link on our "Thank You" page that directs customers to another web site. This web site makes an offer of rebates and discounts for a monthly subscription fee. If you follow the link and only if you accept the offer, Haband will transfer your name, street address and credit card information to the operators of that web site so that they can fulfill the subscription and charge your card. This web site requires your explicit consent to transfer your information if you choose to accept their offer. If any customer follows the link, but does not accept the offer, no personal or credit card information will be transferred. If you wish to review this web site's privacy policy, you can do so at:

Haband Company sends flyers via direct (U.S.) mail to the names appearing on its customer file. From time to time, Haband rents or contributes these names and street addresses to other reputable companies for the purpose of direct mailing only. If you do not want Haband to rent or contribute your name and street address to any third party, please send an e-mail to [service@haband.net](mailto:service@haband.net) with “DO NOT RENT” in the subject line. Please specify the name and street address you wish to be excluded from the rental list. 

There are links on the Haband web site that will take you to other web sites. Haband does not share any of the personal information we gather with the companies that operate those sites. Haband, however, has no control over nor can we make any promises about the privacy polices of those sites. We suggest that you read each site’s privacy policy carefully before providing any personal information.
