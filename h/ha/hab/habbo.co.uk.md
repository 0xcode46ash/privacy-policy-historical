 **YOUR CONSENT**

By using our Websites and submitting any personal information to us or any Sulake UK Affiliate, you consent to our collection, use, transfer and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

 **PERSONAL INFORMATION**

'Personal information' is information about you that allows you to be identified, such as: your name, home addresses, email addresses, other web addresses, usernames and passwords, age (including your date of birth), telephone numbers, credit card numbers or other payment information, and the items you purchase from the Websites. You may submit personal information to us when you visit our Websites. Information is collected through your interaction with us, including:

• your completion of online forms (such as the registration form);   
• your participation in contests and surveys;   
• your subscription for certain newsletters and enhanced services;   
• your posting of messages to the message boards and chat services; and   
• your emails or other communications with us. 

In certain circumstances, we may also keep a record of the conversations that you have with other end users within our Websites. We also collect information automatically about your visit to our Websites using “cookies”. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser about your computer, but not about you. We use cookies to identify your computer when your computer is used to visit us, and to keep track of which webpages and websites you visit so we can build up a demographic profile and learn about what your preferences are. Our use of cookies also allows you to be presented with a personalised version of the Websites and promotional information, and to enable you to access your account.

Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer to, you can disable this feature by removing or blocking these cookies in your browser settings through the “Tools” option on your top menu bar and adapting your “Privacy” settings within the “Internet Options” dialogue box.

 **PURPOSES OF COLLECTION**

If any such acquiring company intends to make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you beforehand.  
2\. * service providers retained by us or a Sulake UK Affiliate to perform functions on its behalf or to provide services to us or a Sulake UK Affiliate, such as Website hosting, data processing and storage, software development and support, advertising and marketing, research, delivery, payment processing, office services, in each case provided that such service provider does not use or disclose your personal information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent.

 **THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING**

Advertisements, promotions, branded areas and other marketing initiatives that are displayed on our Websites are sometimes delivered to you directly by third parties. Our third party advertising partners may directly obtain details of your IP address (which is the unique address of your computer) and may also make use of cookies or other technologies, such as web beacons. A web beacon is an electronic file that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page, or to access certain cookies to provide you with content via our Websites that is more suitable to your personal preferences. 

This Privacy Policy only applies to our use of our own cookies. Use by our advertising and promotional partners of their own cookies and any other similar technologies are subject to their privacy policies. We do not make use of, or have access to, these cookies. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer to, you can disable this feature by removing or blocking these cookies in your browser settings through the “Tools” option on your top menu bar and adapting your “Privacy” settings within the “Internet Options” dialogue box.

 **SECURITY**

We protect your personal information with security safeguards, including physical, organisational and technological measures designed to protect against loss, theft and unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. All personal information you provide us with on the Websites, and all personal information contained in your account (including any credit card details that you may provide), is encrypted. This encoding lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept the encryption. Only our authorised personnel of ours and Sulake UK Affiliates or their partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our, or their, privacy policy.  
That said, it is impossible for us to guarantee that no-one can circumvent the security measures that are in place. For example, we cannot control any illegal and/or unforeseen activity of other users that may allow them to get around the privacy or security settings on our Websites. You acknowledge, therefore, that there may be circumstances in which your personal information may be accessed by unauthorised persons and used for unauthorised purposes.   
Please note that unlike your communications with the Websites, we have no control over the privacy of your e-mail messages with us. We recommend that you do not include personal information in e-mails, including your account password. We are not responsible for any loss or damage if you send us personal information by e-mail.

 **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right, at any time, and from time to time, to modify this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by such modifications. Changes to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately upon providing you with notice, which notice may be given by any means, including without limitation, by posting the change on the Websites or by electronic or conventional mail. You agree to regularly review the Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites following the posting of any change (other than changes to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information) shall constitute your agreement to the modified Privacy Policy. If at any time the modified Privacy Policy is no longer acceptable to you, you should not use the Websites.

 **LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**

Please be aware our Websites may have advertisements and links to third party websites and services that may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy only applies to personally identifiable information that is collected by us and does not cover the practices and policies of these other third parties, and we cannot control the practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours.

 **APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy applies to us. Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against us or a Sulake UK Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon us or a Sulake UK Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that we or a Sulake UK Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law, or in equity, or otherwise.
