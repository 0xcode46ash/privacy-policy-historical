We also collect "cookie" information automatically about your visit to our Website. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser about your computer, but not about you. We use cookies to identify your computer when your computer is used to visit us and to keep track of which webpages and websites you visit so we can build up a demographic profile and learn about what your preferences are. Our use of cookies also allows you to be presented with a personalised version of the Website and promotional information, and to enable you to access your account.

We encourage you to read the policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours. 

**APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**  
This Privacy Policy applies to Habbo Australia. Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against Habbo Australia or a Habbo Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon Habbo Australia or a Habbo Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that Habbo Australia or a Habbo Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or in equity or otherwise.
