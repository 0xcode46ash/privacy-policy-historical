### Secure Shopping

Protecting your order information is a priority. We utilize SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure safe, secure transactions. With SSL, information sent via the Internet is encrypted, and can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered. We believe this element provides the most effective way to ensure that your order information is protected while offering a very secure shopping environment.

We do not transfer credit card numbers via email, and ask that in any email correspondence with us you refrain from doing so as well. If you have any concerns about ordering electronically, please call 1-800-321-1484 to place your order over the phone.
