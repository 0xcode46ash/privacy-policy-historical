# Hawes & Curtis | Privacy policy

Hawes and Curtis are committed to complying with the Data Protection Act 1998 and have published this guide to help our customers understand how and why we collect information from you, to whom this information is disclosed and what your rights as a customer are. 

**What kind of information do we collect and how do we obtain it?**

We receive information in one of three ways, either directly from you online when you register with us, when you register your corporate card offline or from third parties such as credit reference agencies (i.e. to access your credit rating). When you register with us you will be asked to disclose information such as your name, email address, details of your credit card (only if you are paying by credit), telephone number and email address so that we can process and fulfil your order, notify you of your order status and inform you of special offers and promotions if you are a corporate card holder.

How do we use your information? 

We use the information that we collect about you to: 

  1. Process your order 
  2. Manage your account – see also “Use of credit reference agency information” 
  3. Monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop and improve the design and layout of the site 
  4. Notify you about enhancements to our services, such as changes to the website, new services and special corporate offers that may be of interest. 



If you have given us permission to send you information about our products and services by telephone, email or in writing, you agree that by doing so Hawes and Curtis are not in breach of the Telecommunications Regulations 1999 or the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) code of practice. 

Use of Credit Reference Agency Information and sharing of credit information 

In the interests of responsible lending and for security purposes we carry out searches with credit reference agencies when you register with Hawes and Curtis and further searches may be carried out before deciding whether to accept orders and/or grant further credit. The agencies record these searches.  


We also share information about you and the conduct of your account with credit reference agencies, other lenders and relevant third parties. Information about you and other members of your household and those with whom you are financially linked will be used to verify your identity and for the credit assessment of you and them. We may also use your information for payment recovery or fraud and debt tracing. We will pass on details of defaulting accounts to debt collection agencies.  


For details of the Credit Reference Agencies that we receive information from and share information with, write to **[info@hawesandcurtis.com](mailto:info@hawesandcurtis.com)** , quoting Security and Privacy Enquiry.

As a result we may disclose your information to:

  1. Credit Reference Agencies - for more information see above. 
  2. Legal and debt recovery representatives for debt collection and debtor tracing purposes. 
  3. Reputable companies to fulfil your order or process your data on our behalf. 



Hawes and Curtis will not share your information with companies outside Hawes and Curtis for marketing purposes.   
Please be aware that if we are requested, by the police or any other regulatory or Government authority investigating suspected illegal activities, to provide your information and/or use your information, we are entitled to do so.
