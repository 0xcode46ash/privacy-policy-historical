We use your IP address, or the location of your computer on the Internet, to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.

Our site's registration forms, contests and online surveys require users to give us contact information (like, but not limited to, their name and email address) and demographic information (like, but not limited to, their zip code, age, or income level).

We use demographic and profile data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in and displaying content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis, to demonstrate facts about our overall audience.
