The 84 Lumber Company ("84 Lumber") provides this privacy statement for you to explain about the collection and use of personally identifiable information, in particular any such information that is collected the following websites, located at [http://www.84lumber.com](http://www.84lumber.com/), [https://builder.84lumber.com](https://builder.84lumber.com/), [http://innercircle.84lumber.com](http://innercircle.84lumber.com/),  and any sub domain website of 84lumber.com (the "Sites").   This policy applies only to information collected on the Sites and does not apply to information collected from us elsewhere, such as through email messages or offline. 

From time to time our information collection practices may change.  You should check back on this page to see the most recent version of our Privacy Policy.  This privacy policy is effective as of 2/1/2009.

**Information Collection and Use**

In many areas of the Sites, you can browse without submitting personally identifiable information.  Certain features, however, require you to provide us with your personal information. The information you submit is used as described when it is collected. Information you provide is also used for 84 Lumber's legitimate business purposes, including sending you information about us, our stores, our products and services, or other products and services in which you may be interested. 

84 Lumber may use passive tracking technologies, including cookies. These technologies are used to watch consumer behavior on this website, and to customize the content of the site to the consumer in order to improve the consumer's online experience.  These technologies may also be used to improve our site features and functionality, to better understand our consumer, or for other legitimate business purposes.

**Information Sharing and Links to Other Websites**

From time to time, 84 Lumber may share information submitted or collected on this website with third parties.  We may also share aggregate non-personal information with third parties.

Information may be shared with third parties if we believe we are legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties or if we are jointly providing services with a business partner.  In the unlikely event that we are sold or acquired, or part of our business is sold or acquired, your information will be transferred to the new owner.  Your information may also be disclosed if we believe it is necessary to protect 84 Lumber or one of our users.  If we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we may disclose any information about you to government officials; we may also disclose information in response to a subpoena or other governmental request.

This website will provide you with the ability to visit third party websites who may have different policies than those of 84 Lumber, and those third parties are not under 84 Lumber's control.  When you visit any of these other websites and submit information to those third parties, please keep in mind that information will be provided directly to the third parties, and their privacy policies and terms of use will apply.  You should read those documents carefully before submitting information on those websites.
