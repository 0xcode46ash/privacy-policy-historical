# 80sTees: Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy**

**Updated: 5/28/2008**

### Your Credit Card Number

We use industry standard SSL encryption to make sure your credit card data is safe. Additionally, only select employees have access to credit card information. We purge our database of all credit cards 45 days after the transaction is completed.

### Your Email Address

80sTees will not sell or share your email address. Also, we will not contact you with promotional email unless you opt-in to our email list. We use your email address to send you transactional email messages. Transactional email messages include: Order Confirmation, Shipment Notification, Delivery Notification, Request for Product Reviews, and any other email communication needed to facilitate your order.  
You will be given the option to add your email address to our mailing list when you place your order. We suggest you do because we give out discount coupons and announce sales from our list.

### Your Phone Number

We only call our customers if it is necessary to ask a question about an order. We do not sell, share, or rent your phone number. We do not like getting sales calls, and we will not subject our customers to it.

### Your Physical Address and Contact Information

Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information and promotions from 80sTees.com. Periodically we may partner with other companies that want to send promotional material via the postal service to our customers. 

### Your Web Browser

While you are using our site we may record your preferences and browsing history to our database. This information is used so that we may better serve you via our website. We never share this information with other companies. This data may be used to recognize you when you visit our site and to promote products similar to products you have ordered in the past. We sometimes partner with companies who can place banner ads to 80sTees.com on other websites. If you have been to our site in the past you may see 80sTees.com banners more frequently since we target potential customers who have visited the site in the past.
