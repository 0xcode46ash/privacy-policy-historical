## ******8tracks.com Privacy Policy**

At 8tracks.com, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use 8tracks.com's services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. 

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address. You can find more details about the data we collect on particular services by clicking the links on the side of this page.

Data collection 

8tracks.com does not require any personally identifying information. 

8tracks.com collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 

Cookies 

Upon your first visit to 8tracks.com, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. 8tracks.com does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some 8tracks.com features or services may not function properly without cookies.   
Information sharing 

We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals. 

We may share aggregated search information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "jelly beans" or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. 

Links 

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by 8tracks.com's services are developed by people over whom 8tracks.com exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. 

8tracks.com may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of 8tracks.com's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. 

Changes to this Policy

Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent notice. Each version will be noted at the top of the page. Prior versions of this Privacy Policy will be kept in an archive for you to view.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us any time at info @ 8tracks.com
