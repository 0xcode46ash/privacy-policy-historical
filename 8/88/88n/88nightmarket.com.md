In addition to the use of information described above, 88RISING reserves the right to disclose information provided by Users (including Personal Information) as follows:

Disclosure By Law.  You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); (2) protect or defend 88RISING’s, or a third party’s, rights or property; or (3) protect someone’s health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.

We may share your information with third party service providers to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, processing payments, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. 88RISING may also partner with third party service providers for fraud prevention and/or identity verification. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such third party service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize.

Data/Information Transfer As a Result of Sale of Business. In the event that 88RISING is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, 88RISING reserves the right to sell or transfer User information (including Personal Information) as part of any such transaction.  To the maximum extent allowable by law, the Privacy Policy will apply to the User information as transferred to the successor entity. However, User information submitted after a transfer to a successor entity may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.

**Access to Your Personal Information**

Certain information will actively persist on the Service even if you close your account, including messages you posted on our Service.  In addition, personal information may remain in our archives and information you update or delete, or information within a closed account, may persist internally for our administrative purposes, legal compliance reasons, to the extent permitted by law.  In addition, we typically do not remove information you posted publicly through or on our Service. 

**Data Retention**

We keep your information, such as your name, email address and phone number for as long as you keep your account in existence.  In some instances, we will delete the information you provide to us after it is no longer needed. We also keep information about you and your use of the Service for long as it is necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm to you, any third party, or us.

**Children**

The Service is not intended for persons under 18 years of age, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides (“Child” or “Children”), and is not intentionally developed for or directed to Children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any information from Children nor do we knowingly market our products or services to Children. If we learn that we have collected information of a Child, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible and, if applicable, terminate that Child’s account. 

**Third Party Websites**

The Service may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and the inclusion of the linked third-party websites on the Service does not imply our endorsement of the third-party website and/or content and materials found at the linked website, except as specifically stated otherwise by 88RISING.  You will need to check the policy statement of these others websites to understand their policies. When you access a linked site you may be disclosing private information. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

**Cookies and Do Not Track Signals**

When you view the Website, we may store some information on your computer's hard drive. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie." Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. Without accepting a Cookie, your use of the Service may be affected.

Do Not Track Signals from Web Browsers – The Website is not presently configured to support Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals from web browsers. 

**Security**

We take the security of your Personal Information seriously. We appreciate your membership, and will employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and unsolicited contact from third party groups. To that end, all sensitive personal information is transmitted through secure networks supported by SSL encryption.

Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not. A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is subsequently created.  Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.

Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. This request is free and may be made once a year. To make such a request, please email us at the following address:  **cs@88rising.com**

**International Privacy Laws**

If you are visiting 88RISING from outside of the United States, please be aware that you are sending information (including personal data) to the United States, where our servers are located. That information may then be transferred within the United States or back out of the United States to other countries outside of your country of residence, depending on the type of information and how it is stored by us. These countries (including the United States) may not have data protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in the country of your residence, however, our collection, use, and storage of your personal data will at all times remain governed by this Privacy Policy.

**Complaints**

While we hope that you will not need to, if you want to complain about our use of Personal Information please send an email detailing your complaint with the subject line “Personal Information Complaint” to **cs@88rising.com**.
