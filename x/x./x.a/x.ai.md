## About This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”) applies to the website the <https://x.ai/> and various related services (collectively, the “ **Sites** ”, “ **Services** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”) to you (“ **You** ”), the user (“ **User** ”). This Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose information, and what choices you have with respect to the information. This Policy should be read in conjunction with our [Terms of Service](http://x.ai/terms-of-service/).

We understand that by choosing x.ai, you are placing some of your important data in our hands. We are only in business if you trust us, so your privacy means everything to us! Here are the key things you should know:

## Information We Collect and Receive

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. We collect and use this information to provide, improve and protect our Services.

### A. Information Related to Your Account and Interaction with x.ai.

**Registration and Contact Information.** We collect certain “Personally Identifiable Information” from you when you sign up to our Services, that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and any other information that we deem relevant for the purpose of providing you with our Services or which you provided to use voluntarily. This category also includes information tied to your identity that you provide us through other means, such as emails to our support service.

**Team Subscription.** When you create a team account using the Services, we collect an email address, a team name, domain details and user name for the individual setting up the team. In some cases, the Organization (e.g., your employer or another entity) or the individual (e..g. your team administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including Personal Information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products). We collect this information under the direction of our Users. If you are an employee of one of our Users and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your team administrator. If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you must have the authority to provide this information on their behalf and consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Payment Information.** When you purchase the Services, we will also collect transaction information, which may include your credit card information, billing and mailing address, and other payment-related information (“ **Payment Information** ”). We describe how Payment Information may be collected and processed in Section 7.

**Technical, Usage and Location Information**. Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect ”Non-identifying Information” from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.

**Third Party Platforms.** We may collect information when you interact with our advertisements and other content on third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites. This may include information such as “Likes”, profile information gathered from social networking sites or the fact that you viewed or interacted with our content.

**Other Information.** We receive additional information provided to us when submitted to our Sites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with x.ai.

### B. Information Related to Our Service.

**Calendar and Email Information.** In order to perform the Services, we ask for visibility into your calendar, but you can revoke our access to your calendar at any time. x.ai is by design exposed to emails we are explicitly copied on through the Services.

### C. Cookies.

We use cookies, tracking pixels and related technologies. Cookies are small data files that are served by our platform and stored on your device. Our Site uses cookies dropped by us or third parties for a variety of purposes including to operate and personalize the Site. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but this may limit your ability to use the Services

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use your information in the following ways:

  * **to provide, update, maintain, improve and protect our Services** , including to operate certain features and functionality of the Services, to prevent or address service errors (for example, by remembering your calendar information), security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities.
  * **For billing, account management and other administrative matters** , we share and use Payment Information as described in Section 7.
  * **to respond to your support requests, comments and questions.**
  * **to control unauthorized use or abuse of the Services,** if we have a good faith belief, or have received a complaint alleging, that Your Data is in violation of our Acceptable Use Guidelines.
  * **to communicate directly with you,** including by sending you newsletters, promotions and special offers or information about new products and services. You may, at any time, request to opt-out of receiving future emails or notifications from us, by contacting us.



We do not and will not sell Your Data, individually or in aggregated form. We may share or transfer your personal information to third parties only in the following limited circumstances:

**We will display your Account information** on your [https://my.x.ai](https://my.x.ai/) profile page and elsewhere through the Services in accordance with the preferences you set in your Account. You can review and revise your Account information at any time.

**We will display your Your Data within the Services as directed by you.** If you elect to use a third party application through the Services, then we may share or disclose Your Data with that third party application as directed by you. Please remember that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.

**With Trusted Service Providers and Business Partners.** We may utilize trusted third party service providers to assist us in delivering, improving, protecting and promoting the Services. For example, we may use third parties to help host our Services, send out email updates, perform analyses related to the operation of the Services, or process payments. These third party service providers may have access to Your Data for the limited purpose of providing the service we have contracted with them to provide. They are required to have a privacy policy and security standards in place that are at least as protective of your information as is this Privacy Policy. Additional information about the subprocessors we use to support delivery of our Services is set forth at _x.ai Subprocessors._

**In an Aggregate and Non-Personally Identifiable Manner.** We may disclose aggregate non-personally identifiable information (such as aggregate and anonymous usage data, platform types, etc.) about the overall use of our Services publicly or with interested third parties to help them understand, or to help us improve, the Services.

**In Connection With a Sale or Change of Control.** If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the Services can continue to operate. In such case, your information would remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Privacy Policy until such time as this Privacy Policy is updated or amended by the acquiring party upon notice to you.

## Other Access to or Disclosure of Your Information

We restrict access to any data and content you transmit to x.ai or is otherwise made available via the Services to x.ai employees, payment processors, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to perform the Services. All of these individuals are subjected to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

## Security and Information Protection

We take security seriously. We take various steps to protect information you provide to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology. We use commercially reasonable and industry-standard physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. To learn more about our current practices and policies regarding data privacy, security and confidentiality, please see [https://x.ai/security](http://x.ai/security/).

## Payment Information

We use a third party, Stripe, to process subscription payments, and therefore provide them with the Personally Identifiable Information required to charge your credit card. Stripe commits to complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and using industry standard security. Stripe may use your Payment Information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy here: https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal.
