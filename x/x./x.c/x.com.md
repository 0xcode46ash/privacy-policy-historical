X.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site.
  2. The organization collecting the information. 
  3. How the information is used. 
  4. With whom the information may be shared. 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information. 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under X.com's control. 
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 



If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact X.com at [privacy@x.com](mailto:privacy@x.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

TRUSTe certification applies to any information that is collected through this website.

X.com and the providers of goods or services through the X.com Website (“Providers”) recognize the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the practices regarding information provided or obtained in connection with only the X.com Website ([www.x.com](http://www.x.com/)), including information that is personally identifiable to you (“Personal Information”).

You may provide Personal Information in several ways. For example, you may provide Personal Information when you fill out the initial application on the X.com website, when you obtain products or services from a Provider or when you contact a customer service department. In order to open accounts with Providers, it is necessary to collect and retain Personal Information, which may include your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, and age and date of birth.

In connection with goods or services requested or obtained through the X.com Website and/or the operation of the X.com Website, Personal Information about you may be shared and used. The purposes with which Personal Information might be shared or used include the following:

  * Identifying you; 
  * Protecting against error and fraud; 
  * Understanding your needs and eligibility for products and services; 
  * Recommending particular products and services to meet your needs; 
  * Providing ongoing service, including processing your transactions; 
  * In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party; 
  * Complying with legal requirements; 
  * If you otherwise give us your written permission.; 



For example, in order to seamlessly integrate all aspects of the products and services on a secure, easy-to-use Internet platform, Personal Information about you may be shared with the Providers. Thus, Personal Information about you may be shared with First Western National Bank, La Jara, Colorado, which provides banking products and services through the X.com Website. Likewise, Personal Information about you may be shared with credit bureaus or third parties that provide services on behalf of X.com or Providers, such as data processors.

X.com and the Providers seek to limit the information requested to information required to provide you with the products and services offered through this Website. In addition, Personal Information will be safeguarded according to strict standards of security summarized in this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, X.com and the Providers only allow authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of confidential information to have access to Personal Information about you.

A condition of sharing of Personal Information is that the receiving party retain the information pursuant to its own privacy policies, which may be no less stringent than this Privacy Policy. X.com reserves the right to audit Providers to determine if they are complying with their privacy policies.

X.com also collects general information about visits to our site. For example, we compile statistics to determine the number of daily visitors, the pages or sections most frequently visited and how long people remain at each page. This information is used to help meet customer needs. The information is recorded, but is not identified to a specific visitor.

Operation of the X.com Website involves the use of small data files that are saved on a user’s computer, commonly known as “cookies.” However, cookies do not contain any information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means.

You can review and update your profile in X.com’s records through X.com's on-line account maintenance function. We encourage you to correct any inaccurate or outdated information that you may discover.

X.com also seeks to keep Personal Information secure. Interaction with X.com requires an Internet browser that supports: (i) encryption that encodes information so that it can’t be read without decoding; and (ii) Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) version 3.0 protocol, which ensures that unauthorized users cannot interrupt or intercept any communications. Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher or Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher, which utilize automatic SSL activation, should be used. All information exchanged between the X.com website and you will be encrypted using SSL. No financial data will be transmitted over non-SSL connections.

Access to Personal Information about you requires an authenticated login, using a user name/password combination. It is essential that you never reveal your password to anyone and that you change it on a periodic basis. You also should log out if you are going to step away from your computer.

You also should be aware that all databases storing Personal Information about you are situated topologically behind three layers of firewall protection. Tape backup occurs nightly in a secured network environment on our network backbone. These tapes are secured in a vault and retrieved only by authorized personnel. X.com's security measures are actively tested and certified by reputable independent security audit groups on a regular basis.

If you have questions regarding the capacities of your Internet browser, or these security measures, please contact X.com at 888-447-8999 or customerservice@x.com.

X.com and Providers may, from time to time, share information about you and your experiences on the X.com Website with companies that are related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control to X.com or to the Providers, as applicable (“Affiliates”). You may request that X.com or a Provider not share information (other than experience information) with Affiliates by contacting X.com in the manner described below with regard to inquiries about its Privacy Policy.

X.com reserves that right to change this Privacy Policy and to apply such changes to Personal Information collected after the change, but will not do so without posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. Information submitted before the change will never be used in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that new use. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy from time to time to make sure you understand how Personal Information about you may be used.

Information sharing among X.com and the Providers is integral to the quality and cost of services and products provided through the X.com Website. **You should seek a relationship with X.com and the Providers only if you agree with this Privacy Policy.** This Privacy Policy will continue to apply even if you cease to use the products and services of the X.com Website.

We also participate in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBB _OnLine_ ® Privacy Program, and comply with all the BBBOnLine Privacy standards. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact X.com at 888-447-8999 or customerservice@x.com.
