Protecting your information online is of the utmost importance to XPO Logistics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, “XPO Logistics” or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us through the XPO Logistics website located at [www.xpo.com](http://www.xpologistics.com/) (the “Site”) and/or through your use of any software or mobile application offered by XPO Logistics or its affiliates (the “Software”).

**Your Consent**

By using the Site or Software, you agree that this policy governs our collection, use and disclosure of any personal information submitted to us on or through the Site or Software. If you do not agree to be bound by this policy, you may not access or use the Site or Software, and you may not submit any information to us through the Site or Software. This policy applies only to information collected through our Site or Software and not to any information collected offline.

**Protection of Information**

You can visit our Site as often as you like without registering or submitting personal information. However, if you submit a request to us or initiate a contractual relationship with us through our Site or Software, whether as an investor, customer, carrier, vendor, employee or contractor, you may be asked for information, including personally identifiable information, that will allow us to fulfill your request. You acknowledge that your use of the Site and/or Software is conditional on your provision of this information. XPO Logistics and its affiliates and representatives will use such information solely for the purpose of responding to the submitted request and in accordance with this Privacy Policy; however, we may collect the e-mail addresses received through such requests.

In addition, XPO Logistics or its affiliates or representatives may collect certain information by automated means. For example, we collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser when you visit our Site or use the Software. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. We also use “cookies” and other web or mobile technologies to collect information and support certain features of our Site and Software. For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use the Site and Software—which pages they visit, which links they use and how long they stay on each page. The information we collect from your Web browser and from cookies and other Web or mobile technologies does not identify you personally but in some cases we may link it to personally identifiable information. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie (rather than automatically accept all cookies). However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Site, you will limit your access to certain benefits provided by the Site.

No personal information submitted to us will be shared with or sold to any other company or individual for marketing purposes without prior authorization. We may provide certain of your information to our employees and trusted business counterparties, but will do so solely in the course of performing services you have requested. We may also provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our Site or users of the Software, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you.

XPO Logistics or its affiliates or representatives may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on XPO Logistics; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of XPO Logistics; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees, users of our products or services or members of the public.
