# X PRIZE Foundation : Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

At The X PRIZE Foundation we respect your right to privacy. We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and promotions that we provide on XPRIZE.org are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide The X PRIZE Foundation with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not 'opt out,' The X PRIZE Foundation and The X PRIZE Foundation representatives and affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other information. Representatives and affiliates may include value-added resellers and authorised training partners. Beyond its representatives and affiliates, The X PRIZE Foundation does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties.

The X PRIZE Foundation respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users. If you do not want The X PRIZE Foundation or X PRIZE representatives to contact you, you may 'opt out' of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting The X PRIZE Foundation directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt back in and have The X PRIZE Foundation contact you based on your previous or new preferences.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most The X PRIZE Foundation websites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification. Personal information that you post to online forums is accessible by other forum participants. If a user elects to use our Tell A Friend application for forwarding a X PRIZE e-mail to their colleague or informing a colleague about our website, we ask them for the colleagues name and e-mail address. The X PRIZE Foundation will automatically send the colleague the specified e-mail or the specified website information. The X PRIZE Foundation will not use the colleague's information to contact them in the future.
