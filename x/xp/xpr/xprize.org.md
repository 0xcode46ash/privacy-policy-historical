## THE X-PRIZE FOUNDATION  
PRIVACY POLICY  
(United States)

**BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY TERM IN THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR SUBMIT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.**

**1\. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY**

The X-Prize Foundation (“X PRIZE”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all information submitted by you on this website and it explains the type of information we may collect and how we may use it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to be aware of our privacy protection procedures and the use of your personal information you provided to us. Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies only to this X PRIZE website for the United States and does not address information that we might obtain from places other than this website. Since other websites (including those to which we link) have their own privacy practices, we encourage you to ask questions and provide information only to those sites whose privacy practices you understand and trust. Also, we reserve the right to revise our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice, so please check this page periodically. 

**2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

**2.1 What Information We Collect**

We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address. Our servers typically log your IP address when you request a page from this website. We also log such information as your resolution settings, browser information, platform type, and originating URLs. You remain anonymous to us since we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. However, we also collect personally identifiable information about you when you voluntarily submit it to us, such as by: registering for a product warranty; filling out a form or survey; Posting Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use); requesting promotional material; registering your e-mail address with us; signing up for an e-mail newsletter; or, e-mailing us.

Our website has been designed to meet your needs. As is standard practice on many corporate websites, X PRIZE’s website utilizes cookies to gather technical information. A cookie is a small data file installed on your computer hard drive by a web server. Generally speaking, it records data about your computer's navigation within our website (pages viewed, date and time of your visit, etc.), which are read during subsequent visits. Cookies provide websites with information regarding the state your browser is in. For example, if you have visited the site before (a state of “this browser has visited this site before”), you will not have to fill out a X PRIZE registration form again during subsequent visits in order to benefit from our personalized services. Our website may also use the servers of our advertising partners to display the advertisements seen on our website pages. These partners may also utilize cookies to help target the advertisements shown towards your needs.

Please note that if your internet browser is configured to not accept cookies, we cannot guarantee that the services available to you on our website will work correctly.

**2.2 How We Use This Information**

Pursuant to the Terms of Use, you have expressly assigned all rights in and to Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use) to X PRIZE. X PRIZE and/or its subsidiaries may, in their sole discretion, use information submitted at the time of registration or any Submissions for marketing, promotional and any other commercial purposes and may share such information or Submissions with our promotional partners in accordance with the Terms of Use. We may use your contact information to send you information about our company’s current activities. You may decide at any time to stop receiving future mailings. 

Your personally identifiable information may be shared with and stored on a database controlled by third parties that have been hired by us to provide limited services on our behalf. Agents or contractors of X PRIZE who have access to your personally identifiable information are required to use their best efforts to keep the information confidential and are prohibited from using this information for any purpose not previously disclosed to you.

We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for site administration and for the purpose of performing the services for which such data was collected.

We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, unless disclosure is required by law or to protect our interests. At times, X PRIZE may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information; this includes special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with X PRIZE’s rights. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

We use your IP address, resolution settings, browser information, platform type, and originating URLs to help diagnose problems with our server, measure usage, and to administer the site. 

You agree that any commentary on our products or services that you provide to us belongs to us and can be used and published by us for any purpose, so long as we do not identify you as the source or author of such commentary without your consent.

Even though our information practices may change from time to time, we will not use your information in a manner not previously disclosed to you in our Privacy Policy. We will provide you with notice by posting any privacy policy changes on this website. 

**3\. UPDATING OR CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION**

If you provide us with personally identifiable information to have us perform ongoing services to you, we will use reasonable diligence to provide you with a way to review the information we have on file and either update or correct this information.

**4\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION**

We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information. 

**5\. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS**

Your privacy is very important to us. We use security technology and security procedures that are reasonably designed to help maintain the privacy of your personal information. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access this data. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. Further, please note that our web servers may be run by a third party web host whose actions we do not control. 

**6\. TERMS OF USE**

Please consult our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) for the conditions under which X PRIZE makes its website available to users and the conditions under which users may have access to and use this website. 

**7\. AMENDMENTS**

This Privacy Policy became effective on September 26, 2007. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy. Any amendments will be effective when posted. Your continued access of this website shall be deemed your acceptance and complete understanding of the amended Privacy Policy. 

As this privacy policy is designed to become more comprehensive over time, we want it to develop in line with your requirements and expectations. We are therefore open to all questions and suggestions related to our privacy policy. Please feel free to send us your comments the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact) section of this website.
