For example, like many Web sites, we use ´cookies,´ and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses xpressdocs´ website.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us and let us know.
  * **Information from other sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

## Does xpressdocs´ website share the information it receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.

  * **Financial processing:** We use [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/) for our credit card processing – a well recognized and reputable financial processing company. Information required to process a credit card transaction is securely transmitted to [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/) (for example, Name, Address, Credit Card Number, etc) for payment authorization and processing. For information on their security and privacy policies, please visit their website at [www.authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/).

## How secure is information about me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/) during order processing.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, or close the browser window.
