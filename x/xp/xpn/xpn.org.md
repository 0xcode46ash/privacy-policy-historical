# Privacy

##  Privacy 

### Sssssh! Your secrets are safe with us.

When you're part of a family, you have to share a bit of information - otherwise, we'd walk around calling each other 'hey, you.' But you can be sure that we take every precaution to keep your personal information as safe as possible. All of our data, especially credit card information, is kept in secure areas and we have the experts at the University of Pennsylvania behind us on that. We're always monitoring the most recent advances in security and adapting - even though this is incredibly boring. 

Of course, we hope it's okay if we contact you occasionally. How else can we invite you to great events? If you don't receive our e-newsletters, do sign up. They are the best way to learn about the many, many opportunities you have to gather with the XPN Community and get the inside scoop on XPN and music news. It also makes it a lot easier for us to remind you how much your support is needed to do all this good stuff. 

WXPN does make your contact information, including name, address, phone number and email address and some financial data available to third party companies that do data analysis or perform other functions, like mailing letters, to help us serve you better and do our jobs better. 

We will never share your email address or your phone number with anyone not performing work on our behalf, because that's just rude. We do share our membersâ€™ names and addresses occasionally with other organizations that we think you may be interested in supporting (usually arts, music and cultural organizations). You can opt-out of this kind of information sharing with a simple email to Member Services. 

Finally, XPN does track general information about people visiting our site and other pages with trusted third party tracking service by reading browser settings. This does not include any personal information. It just helps us figure out how many folks are enjoying what we do online and aren't really interested in things like privacy policies. 

### Opt Out

But you are the boss. If you don't want us to share your name and address with third parties not doing work on our behalf - done. Don't want us to contact you (as sad as that would make us)? - done. {emailcloak=off}[Just drop us a quick email here](mailto:xpn885@xpn.org). If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, please feel free to [send an email to the WXPN Online Dept](mailto:online@xpn.org). 

Any content that you submit to us, must follow the University of Pennsylvania's policy on Copywrite Infringement located [here](http://www.upenn.edu/computing/security/reporting_copyright.php).
