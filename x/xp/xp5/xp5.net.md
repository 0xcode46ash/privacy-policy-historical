# Privacy Policy - Free Online Games (XP5.NET)

## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

As a registered Facebook user, you are also subject to Facebook’s privacy policy. Please check your Facebook account privacy settings for further information.

## Collecting information about you

We collect different types of information about App users for four main reasons:

1\. To personalise the content of the App for individual users.  
2\. To help us to monitor and improve the App.  
3\. To advertise on the App.  
4\. With user consent, to market services to individual users.

## Sharing your information with us and others

When you first access the App, for example by clicking on a link to a Game application from your Facebook newsfeed, you will be presented with a Facebook permissions page, which will advise you about the Facebook information you will be sharing with the App and other Facebook users. You can then decide whether or not to share your Facebook information by using the App. If you decide not to grant permission you will not be able to use the App.

By granting permission you will be agreeing to share your Facebook user details (including your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID and any other information you choose to share according to your Facebook account settings) as well as the user details of your Facebook friends, and information about your use of the App, for example, the game you are playing.

If you choose to post content or other data on the App, for example, by commenting on an game, this can be accessed by all of your Facebook friends.

## What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

* Internal record keeping.

* We may use the information to improve our products and services.

* We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## General Policy.

The games provided by this site are considered to be from the public domain, e.g. they are widely found on many other gaming sites etc., and comply with second party site’s policies. We try our best to give as much credit back to those authors/owners/organisations etc. as possible.

But if you believe such a game should not be featured on our website, Please contact us at webmaster@xp5.nry and we shall arrange to take off the game as soon as possible. Usually within 24-48 hours.”

## Log Files

Like many other Web sites, xp5.net makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

xp5.net does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser.

A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a xp5. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.

We may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which deliver cookies to your computer so the ads you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use Non-Personal Information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We will not provide these third party advertising companies with any Personal Information.

For example, we have contracted with certain companies to place tool bars and advertisements on our applications for cross-promotion purposes. These companies may monitor certain pages of our Service for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement “click-thrus,” and/or other activities on our Service. They use monitoring technologies to compile statistics about our Service visitors.

## Our Commitment To Childrens Privacy

The Service is not geared toward children under the age of 14 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 14. If we learn that a child under 14 has provided us with Personal Information we will delete such information from our files.

## Links to third party Ads

From time to time we may include at the Site links to other websites as a service to you. The third party sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by the policies and practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of these third parties before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.

We allow third party advertisers to post advertisements on our Site. These third parties may place cookies on certain pages of our Site. We do not control those third parties, or their cookies. This privacy policy does not cover those third party advertisers use of cookies.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

The contents of this statement may be altered at any time, at our discretion.
