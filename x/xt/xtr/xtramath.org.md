# XtraMath Privacy Policy

XtraMath Privacy Policy
XtraMath is committed to protecting your privacy. Your or your child’s/student’s use of the
XtraMath program indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept all of
the terms of this Privacy Policy you should not use XtraMath. This Privacy Policy may change,
so please refer back to it periodically.
1.        Information we ask you to provide
We collect the minimum amount of information required to operate the program and understand
its effectiveness. We collect information when you sign up a child to use XtraMath. From parents
and teachers, this information includes your full name and email address and your
child’s/student’s first name and grade level. Teachers also provide the name of their school. We
do not request or receive any information from children who use the program other than
retaining their XtraMath performance data so they can progressively build their math skills.
Further, a child cannot create their own account. A parent or teacher must do it for them.
2.        XtraMath’s use of the information you provide
We will only use your email address to send you reports, alerts, reminders, and announcements
related to XtraMath. You can control what types of email you receive and can opt out of email
entirely.
Parent, teacher and child personal information is never shared, sold or provided to third parties,
except that information may be provided to trusted third parties who assist in operating our
website to the extent necessary for them to provide those services. De-identified, aggregate
visitor and performance data may be provided to third parties for other uses including research.
Data will be anonymized so that it is impossible to identify any individual, classroom, school or
district.
XtraMath uses "localStorage" to store computer-specific preferences such as remembered
sign-ins.
We also release information if required by law.
3.        Non-personal information
We may collect non-personal information about you when you visit our website. Non-personal
information may include IP addresses, browser types, access times, and technical information
concerning connection to the website. We may use this information for internal purposes, for


example, to improve the website, analyze usage patterns, and negotiate with vendors of Internet
services. That information does not include your Personal Information. We use cookies to track
aggregate usage statistics through Google Analytics.
4.      Security
We treat security seriously and take reasonable measures to protect each user’s personal
information. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information. While we strive to use industry-standard practices to protect your
information, XtraMath cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. If XtraMath
discovers that our security has been breached and your information has been released without
your permission, we will investigate the circumstances and notify you within thirty days. We will
also remove all of your information from our system at any time upon your request.
5.      Notification of changes
We strongly believe in respecting your privacy. We will update and amend this Privacy Policy if
and when it is necessary. Please check back periodically to read our most updated and
amended version. Your or your child’s/student’s continued use of the XtraMath program means
that you consent to our updates and amendments.
If XtraMath decides to use your information in a manner different from that stated at the time of
collection, we will notify you in advance by email. You may choose whether or not XtraMath may
use the information in this manner. In addition, if XtraMath makes any material changes in our
privacy practices that do not affect your information already stored in the XtraMath database, we
will post a prominent notice on our website notifying you of the change. In some cases when
XtraMath posts such notice, we may also email you to notify you of the changes to this Privacy
Policy.
6.      Contact
You may contact XtraMath if you have questions or concerns, or to request the deletion of your
information in our system, by contacting e ​ rika@xtramath.org​.
