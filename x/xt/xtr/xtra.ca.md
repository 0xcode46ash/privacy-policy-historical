# Privacy policy – Xtra

**THIS PRIVACY POLICY WAS LAST UPDATED ON: June 19, 2017**

Pink Triangle Press (collectively “we”, “our” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users (collectively “you” or “your”) of our websites (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy is applicable to any of our Sites that make reference to this Privacy Policy.

While many aspects of our Sites do not require you to register before using them, other activities such as signing up for a newsletter or entering a contest require registration or membership. Personal information is collected through these registration and membership processes which may be conducted through other platforms such as Google Forms, MailChimp, Gleam and others. Apart from using the information for those purposes, all data and findings collected through these means and used for statistical information is presented as anonymous or aggregated information. We will never release personal information about individual users.

**Under-Age People.** Anybody under 18 years of age should ensure they have permission from their parent or guardian before providing any personal information.

**Cookies.** In order for our Sites to function properly, we occasionally place small data files called “cookies” on your computer or mobile device – here is some additional information about cookies:

**What are Cookies?** A cookie is a small text file that is saved on your computer or mobile device when you visit one of our Sites. It enables the Site to remember some of your actions and preferences (such as login, display preferences or other things), so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the Site or browse from one section to another.

**How Do We Use Cookies?** When you create an account with us, we use cookies for the management of the signup process and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out; however, in some cases they may remain afterward to remember your preferences on the Site when you are logged out.

We also use cookies while you are logged in to prevent you from having to log in again every time you visit a new page; these cookies are typically cleared when you log out to ensure you can only access restricted features and areas of the Sites while you are logged in.

In order to provide you with a great experience on our Sites, we provide you with the ability to set your own preferences for how a Site functions when you use it. We need to set cookies on your device to remember your preferences, so this information can be retrieved whenever you use a function of a Site that is affected by your personal settings **.**

**Third Party Cookies.** In some cases, we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter through our Sites.

We use Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the Internet, to help us understand how you use our Sites and to develop ways to improve your experience. We have also enabled the [Demographics and Interest](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357) feature which provides us with data from Google’s Interest-based advertising and 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests). This feature allows us to better evaluate who our users are, how their behaviour varies by demographics and interests, and ultimately help us create more appropriate content for our users. You can choose to opt-out of this feature using [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) or [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**How To Control Cookies.** You can control and delete cookies as you wish – for more information, please see [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.
