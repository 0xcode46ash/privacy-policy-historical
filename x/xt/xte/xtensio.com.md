**COOKIES**

When you visit our Properties we may place “cookies” on your computer to recognize you.  We do this to enhance your experience on the Properties (such as storing your preferences), collect statistical data, and track how you use our Properties.

Cookies are widely used, and most web browsers are configured to accept them automatically. If you prefer not to accept cookies, please configure your browser settings accordingly, but note that in doing so you may be unable to experience certain features of the Properties.

Additionally, we may embed pixel tags on web pages, ads and emails in order to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page was viewed). We may use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services.

**MOBILE DEVICE ID**

If you’re using our mobile or other software applications (“ **Applications** ”), we may use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We may do this to store your preferences and track your use of the Applications. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted.
