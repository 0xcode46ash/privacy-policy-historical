# Xara Online web service applications for your website

At **Xara** we believe that strong electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial, and entertainment medium, but we do need to understand our members' behavior in order to develop the most appropriate tools for you. To achieve this goal, we need to understand what makes our members different which is why we sometimes collect information when you complete our registration form. 

  


**Xara** gathers information about customers that allows us to offer compelling products and services and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well. When you open an account with **Xara** we may ask you to provide information such as your first and last name, email address, geographical location and how you came to join us. We ask these questions in case we need to verify your identity for security purposes. 

  


Any information you provide to **Xara** when registering for our products or services is maintained and accessible only by **Xara** unless you elect to join any of our partner services at which point your details will be passed to these carefully selected partners who will also strive to maintain your privacy. Every customer can freely choose not to join any of our partner services and as a result the personal information submitted will not be passed to any of our partners. 

We analyze general browsing habits with a view to presenting you with the most relevant and valuable information and services. We develop summary - not individual - reports for advertisers (who make it possible for you to use **Xara** services for free) to determine the effectiveness of their advertising investments. We never tell advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 

Except as described in this Privacy statement, **Xara** will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant), in circumstances where **Xara** , in its sole discretion, deems appropriate at the request of law enforcement officials, or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. 

  


Except as described in this Privacy statement, **Xara** will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used by **Xara** to provide a personalized experience to you. 

  


You can correct or modify your password, E-mail address and other personal information by first signing-in and then selecting " **My Details** " from your Module Store, once you have amended your details simply click " **Save** " to update our records and return to your Module Store.
