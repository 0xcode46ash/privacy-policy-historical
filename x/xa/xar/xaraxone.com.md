# Privacy Policy - Xara Xone

XARA has created this privacy statement in order to **demonstrate the company’s firm commitment to privacy**. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Xara web [www.xaraxone.com](http://xaraxone.com/)

**Xara Group Ltd is 100% owned by Magix AG and references to Xara in this document should be taken to mean both Xara and Magix.**

## Information collected by download forms, opt-in mailing list and surveys

Certain visitors to this website choose to interact with it in ways that require Xara to gather personally-identifying information, described in this section. In each case, Xara collects such information and only shares it with its employees and contractors, and only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the actions described in this section. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in these activities. Xara will not rent or sell personally-identifying information to anyone.

The site’s **mailing list sign-up forms** offer site visitors the option to subscribe to our email newslists. Contact information from this form is used to send information about Xara products and the company to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at the time; see the choice/opt-out section below.

The site’s **download forms** require users to give us contact information (their name, country and e-mail address). Contact information from this form is used to send information about Xara products and the company to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at the time of downloading or subsequently; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Occasionally we run **online surveys** which may ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level) and questions about their use of Xara’s products and web site. The customer’s contact information may be used to contact the visitor when necessary but **is not used for mailings**. This demographic, product and web site information is used to help improve Xara’s products, customer service and website.

Occasionally we run **contests** for which purpose we will ask contest entrants for their contact information (their name, email address, postal address) and potentially other questions relevant to the contest so that we can announce the results and deliver the prize. This information is **not used for mailings**.
