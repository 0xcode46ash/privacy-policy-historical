Xaxis Privacy Policy

 **Effective Date: December 9, 2016**

Xaxis is firmly committed to protecting user privacy and fostering user confidence in the Internet and digital advertising.  We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide clear notice about the information we may collect in connection with our Services (as defined in Section 1 below), including activities we undertake across web sites, applications and other digital properties (collectively, “Sites”), and on our corporate web site, [www.xaxis.com](http://www.xaxis.com/) (“Xaxis Web Site”), which is operated by Xaxis, Inc.  

For information on how we use data and cookies as part of our business to provide digital advertising services to our clients, please see Section 1 below. For information on how we use data and cookies on the Xaxis Web Site, please see Section 2 below.

Except as expressly stated otherwise, the use of information by our non-Xaxis affiliates, our clients and our service providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  

Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy laws and regulations, user needs, and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand our privacy practices, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred.  You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Effective Date” above.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us through email or by mail.  You can address your general questions and comments by e-mail to [privacy@xaxis.com](mailto:privacy@xaxis.com) or by mail to us at c/o Xaxis, Inc., 132 West 31 Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10001, Attn: Legal Department.

 **Section 1: Xaxis Services Privacy Policy and Cookies**

 **Xaxis’s Services**

We provide a range of services to our clients, including advertisers, agencies, publishers, and service providers. Xaxis’s services (“Services”) include: media planning, buying and selling; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement; search engine optimization; and audience segmentation and data management. Our clients use our Services in order to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant ads. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Xaxis’s Services do not include the services of Xaxis’s Light Reaction performance marketing division. For information on how Light Reaction collects and uses information through its services (as opposed to the collection and use of information through the Services or on the Xaxis Web Site), please click [here](http://lightreaction.com/en/policy_emea_apac/). 

 **Types of Information We Collect through Our Services**

When you view and interact with Sites and with advertisements where our Services are utilized, we may collect through our Services information regarding your browsing, usage and interactions. We may also collect information that identifies browsers and devices we have interacted with previously. Such information collected through our Services may include the type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system you use, your device’s Internet protocol (“IP”) address, unique identifiers available at or pertaining to your device, connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), region where your device is located, network to which your device is connected, longitude/latitude of a (mobile) device, mobile carrier (if available), the Site and page you came from before, and visited after, viewing an advertisement, and information related to the Site and page you are viewing (i.e., in order to ascertain your interests). Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an Internet connection.

We do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services.  

We collect information through the use of cookies, pixels and other technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a browser by a Site or ad server which allows that Site or ad server to recognize that browser and remember user preferences and other information. A pixel is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign online activities to a device or browser. The use of a pixel allows Sites and us to record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular Site or page. Additional information from an earlier period or interaction, which may include interest, demographic or other information intended to provide users with more useful and relevant online advertising, may also be associated with such device or browser.

 **How We Use Information Collected through Our Services**

We use the information collected through our Services to help ensure that you receive the most useful and relevant online advertising you see on Sites (including on web sites in a browser environment and/or in applications, and on other devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the device and/or browser where the information was collected) (we refer to customized advertising based on users’ interests as “Interest-Based Advertising”). For example, if we think that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver Interest-Based Advertisements to that user about a particular type of apparel, as follows:

  

Such information may also be used to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, and for other purposes such as research, reporting and analysis in order to deliver the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising.

We may also receive from other companies information collected outside the Services for use in connection with the Services, also to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising. We do not associate such information with your name, mailing address, email address or similar personally identifiable information.

We require our clients to comply with applicable laws governing online privacy.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the Sites you visit to better understand issues relating to your online privacy.

 **Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

We may disclose the information we collect about you (see “Types of Information We Collect through Our Services” above), and information derived from it, to our clients and service providers.  As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties.  However, if you decide to provide personally identifiable information via one of our clients’ advertisements or Sites, then that information will be received by that client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy.  Our service providers are not permitted to use non-aggregated information we disclose to them for any purpose other than providing services to us or our clients.

Xaxis, Inc. operates and maintains a proprietary data management platform that affiliates controlled by Xaxis, Inc., including Light Reaction, utilize in order to provide services.

We also may disclose the information we collect to third parties, including law enforcement, when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

 **Disclosure of Information to Market Research Companies**

We may disclose the information we collect about you to market research companies, which companies can add demographic, interest, and similar information to the information collected by us. We may aggregate this information together with the information we collect about you, for purposes of research, reporting, analysis and optimization of online advertising campaigns.

 **User Choice**

We collect information through our Services via the use of cookies, pixels and other technologies.  We believe that the use of these technologies enables us and our clients to provide users with a more useful digital experience.

You may simply choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements via Xaxis cookies on the browser you are using by clicking below, in which case your unique third-party Xaxis cookie will be replaced with a non-unique “opt-out” cookie and the Interest-Based Advertising data previously collected or received in association with the replaced unique third-party Xaxis cookie will not be used for Interest-Based Advertising on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to the browser where the information was collected:

[](http://xaxis.com/static/view/opt-out-confirmation)

Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire ten years after they are initially issued.  If you buy a new device, upgrade or change web browsers or delete this opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out process again.  In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept third-party cookies.   

You may also opt out from Xaxis cookies, and in some cases refuse or remove cookies from both Xaxis and other service providers, via the following methods:

  * You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies, which would result in the elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via cookies from other providers in addition to Xaxis.  However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites you visit or take full advantage of all Site offerings and Interest-Based Advertising.  You may refuse or remove cookies by following the directions provided in your browser settings.  Further information about cookies is available at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers#cookies>. 
  * You may adjust the initial cookie settings at the level of the Site owner where you granted us your consent to our cookie usage, to the extent made available by the cookie settings deployed by the applicable Site owner.
  * You may simply opt out of Interest-Based Advertising via our cookies, as well as the cookies of other service providers, at the following Sites:
    * [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
    * <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>
    * <http://youradchoices.ca/choices/>
    * [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (by clicking the “Your ad choices” link after selecting your country)



You may also choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements from Xaxis and other service providers in a mobile app environment (instead of via cookies in a browser environment) by selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” via your mobile device settings.

 **Network Advertising Initiative**  

We are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to the NAI’s Codes of Conduct in those markets where these self-regulatory frameworks apply and are in effect.  In accordance with the Codes of Conduct, we require our Xaxis Marketplace (formerly Xaxis Publisher Network and 24/7 Access) clients to inform users about their privacy and information collection practices via their privacy policies and to include in their privacy policies information regarding the use of third-party advertising technology and services on their Sites, the types of data collected through these services, the use and distribution of that data, and a link to an industry standard opt-out from Interest-Based Advertising.  We periodically monitor the Sites of our clients to determine whether they are adequately disclosing and updating their privacy statements.

We fully support the digital advertising industry’s efforts to increase transparency in the area of Interest-Based Advertising and health segments.  For more information on standard interest segments based on health-related information or interests that we may use for Interest-Based Advertising purposes, please click [here](http://www.xaxis.com/static/view/consumer-interest-segments).

You can also click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to reach the Network Advertising Initiative site, a central location for information about Interest-Based Advertising and the choices available to you, and to opt out of receiving third-party Interest-Based Advertising via cookies from us and NAI member companies.

 **Digital Advertising Alliance, IAB Europe, and Ad Choices**

Xaxis supports deployment of the Advertising Option icons (AdChoices and AppChoices) as part of its participation in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory framework (in the United States) and the IAB Europe OBA Framework (in Europe).  Advertisements that are provided by organizations that participate in these frameworks will display the icon displayed below when technologically feasible.  If you click on the icon displayed on an ad, you will receive information about Interest-Based Advertising.

  

You can click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) to reach the Digital Advertising Alliance site, which has additional information about Interest-Based Advertising and the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory framework, as well as a mechanism to opt out of receiving third-party Interest-Based Advertising via cookies from us and DAA member companies.

 **Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada and  European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance**

We are a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and, in connection with such memberships, adhere to the Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising and the IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising, respectively, in those markets where such applicable self-regulatory framework applies. For information about Interest-Based Advertising and the choices available to you, and to opt out of third-party Interest-Based Advertisements from us and other participating member companies via cookies, please click [here](http://youradchoices.ca/) (for DAAC) or [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (for EDAA).

 **Children’s Privacy**

We are sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy.  Therefore, neither the Services nor the Xaxis Web Site is developed for, or directed at, children or at Sites primarily directed to children.  If you believe a child has provided us with personal information and you would like to have the information removed, please contact us at [privacy@xaxis.com](mailto:privacy@xaxis.com).

 **Transfer of Data in the Event of Acquisition**

In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any information a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.

 **Information Security**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to, unlawful processing of, unauthorized retention of, and unauthorized disclosure of data.  These standards include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.  Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential information.  Please keep in mind, however, that despite these efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect such data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security in relation to any such data.

We are a global company and therefore we may transfer data to countries around the world, including countries outside your country or your continent.  We will, where necessary, put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure such data is protected.

 **Data Retention**

We generally maintain the information we collect through our Services in non-aggregated form for a period of not more than thirteen months.  This data includes Sites visited, content viewed, ad interactions, IP addresses (please see the “Europe” subsection below for additional information about IP addresses), browser type and language settings.

We may maintain information we collect through our Services in an aggregated form for a period longer than thirteen months.

 **IP Address**

Please note that in some countries an IP address is considered personal data by applicable law.  If we conduct business in any such country and we know that you are located in that country, we will treat your IP address as personal data.

In these countries we interpose a “black box” that is operated by an independent third party and that separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect.  As a result of this black box, IP address in those countries does not touch Xaxis’s systems and is not processed by Xaxis in connection with the provision of Services.
