Xaxis Privacy Policy

 **Effective Date: March 22, 2017**

Xaxis is firmly committed to protecting user privacy and fostering user confidence in the Internet and digital advertising.  We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide clear notice about the information we may collect in connection with our Services (as defined in Section 1 below), including activities we undertake across web sites, applications and other digital properties (collectively, “Sites”), and on our corporate web site, www.xaxis.com (“Xaxis Web Site”), which is operated by Xaxis, Inc. 

To learn about how we use data and technology as part of our business to provide digital advertising services to our clients, please see Section 1 below.  To learn about how we use data and cookies on the Xaxis Web Site, please see Section 2 below.

Xaxis is part of the GroupM media investment group; GroupM is part of the WPP, plc group of companies.  Except as expressly stated otherwise, the use of information by our non-Xaxis affiliates, our clients, our service providers, and other third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that because of the changing nature of privacy laws and regulations, digital technologies, and our business, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Accordingly, since we want to help you clearly understand our privacy practices, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred.  You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Effective Date” above.  If you continue to use the Xaxis Web Site or our Services after such changes, we will take that as an indication that you have accepted the updated terms. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us through email or by mail.  You can address your general questions and comments by e-mail to privacy@xaxis.com or by mail to us at c/o Xaxis, Inc., 132 West 31 Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10001, Attn: Legal Department.

 **Section 1: Xaxis Services**

 **Xaxis’s Services**

We provide a range of services to our clients, including advertisers, agencies, publishers, and service providers.  Xaxis’s services (“Services”) include: media planning, buying and selling; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; paid search placement; search engine optimization; and audience segmentation and data management.  Our clients use our Services in order to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant ads and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising. 

 **Types of Information We Collect through Our Services**

When you view and interact with Sites and with advertisements where our Services are utilized, we may collect through our Services information regarding your browsing, usage and interactions.  We may also collect information that identifies browsers and devices we have interacted with previously.  Such information collected through our Services may include the type of Internet browser, browser language, and operating system you use, your device’s Internet protocol address (“IP address”), unique identifiers available at or pertaining to your device, connection type (wired or Wi-Fi), region where your device is located, network to which your device is connected, longitude/latitude of a (mobile) device, mobile carrier (if available), the Site and page you came from before, and visited after, viewing an advertisement, and information related to the Site and page you are viewing (i.e., in order to ascertain your interests).  Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an Internet connection. 

We do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services.

We may also receive information from other companies, including our clients, that is collected outside our Services and is provided to us for use in connection with the Services.  We may integrate that information with information collected through our Services.

 **How We Collect Information through Our Services**

We collect information through the use of cookies, advertising IDs, pixels and other technologies.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a browser by a web site or ad server which allows that web site or ad server to recognize that browser and remember user preferences and other information.  An advertising ID is an alphanumeric identifier made available by a platform or operating system (such as Apple iOS or Google Android) that allows application developers and third parties to recognize a particular device in an application environment and remember User Information (defined below) and other information.  A pixel is a line of code that is used by a Site or third party to assign online activities to a device or browser.  The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a device or browser has visited a particular Site or page.  Additional information from an earlier period or interaction, which may include User Information intended to provide users with more useful and relevant online advertising, may also be associated with such device or browser.

We may collect and utilize information about users and activities across different Sites, and associate it across applicable devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the same user.  We may also utilize information that we receive from other companies, and associate it with information we collect and across applicable devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the same user.  These practices are intended to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant ads regardless of device or browser.

 **How We Use Information Collected through Our Services**

We use the information collected through our Services to help ensure that you receive the most useful and relevant online advertising you see on Sites (including on web sites in a browser environment and/or in applications, and on other devices and browsers that we have reasonably linked to the device and/or browser where the information was collected) (we refer to customized advertising based on users’ interests, demographic information, prior activity, and similar information (“User Information”), as “Interest-Based Advertising”).  For example, if we think that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver Interest-Based Advertisements to that user about a particular type of apparel, as follows: 

  

Such User Information may also be used to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, and for other purposes such as research, reporting and analysis in order to deliver the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising. 

We may also receive from other companies User Information collected outside the Services for use in connection with the Services, also to help ensure that online users receive the most useful and relevant advertising and to determine and improve the effectiveness of that advertising.  We do not associate such information with your name, mailing address, email address or similar personally identifiable information. 

We require our clients to comply with applicable laws governing online privacy.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the Sites you visit to better understand issues relating to your online privacy.

 **Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

We may disclose the information we collect about you (see “Types of Information We Collect through Our Services” above), and information derived from it, to our clients and service providers.  As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties.  However, if you decide to provide personally identifiable information via one of our clients’ advertisements or Sites, then that information will be received by that client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy.  Our service providers are generally not permitted to use non-aggregated information we disclose to them for any purpose other than providing services to us or our clients.

Our affiliate mPlatform operates and maintains a proprietary data management platform that we and other affiliates may utilize in order to provide services.  The information we disclose to mPlatform may be used by mPlatform and such other affiliates not only to provide services to us and our clients, but also to provide services to those affiliates and their respective clients.

We may also disclose the information we collect to third parties, including law enforcement, when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

 **User Choice**

You may opt out of Xaxis Interest-Based Advertising through several mechanisms.

You may choose not to receive customized third-party advertisements via Xaxis targeting cookies on the browser you are using by clicking below, in which case your third-party Xaxis targeting cookie will be replaced with an “opt-out” cookie and the Interest-Based Advertising data previously collected or received in association with the replaced third-party Xaxis targeting cookie will not be used for Interest-Based Advertising on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to the browser where the information was collected.  In addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or browser is linked to the opted-out browser, that other device or browser will also be opted out from receiving Interest-Based Advertising via Xaxis.

[](http://xaxis.com/static/view/opt-out-confirmation)

Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire ten years after they are initially issued.  If you buy a new device, upgrade or change web browsers or delete this opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out process again.  In order for the opt-out process to work, your browser must be set to accept third-party cookies.   

In browser environments, you may also refuse or remove cookies from both Xaxis and other service providers via the following methods:

  * You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies, which would result in the elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via cookies from Xaxis and from other providers in addition to Xaxis.  However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on certain web sites you visit or take full advantage of all web site offerings and Interest-Based Advertising.  You may refuse or remove cookies by following the directions provided in your browser settings.  Further information about cookies is available at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers#cookies>. 
  * You may adjust the cookie settings at the level of the web site owner where you granted us your consent to our cookie usage, to the extent made available by the cookie settings deployed by the applicable web site owner.
  * You may simply opt out of Interest-Based Advertising via our cookies, as well as the cookies of other service providers, at the following Sites:

In mobile app environments, you may opt out of Interest-Based Advertising from just Xaxis or from both Xaxis and other service providers via the following methods:

  * You may select “Limit Ad Tracking” via your device settings, which will result in the elimination of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable advertising ID from Xaxis and from other providers in addition to Xaxis.
  * You may opt out of Interest-Based Advertising via the applicable advertising ID from Xaxis and/or other providers via the AppChoices app.  Please note that, in order for the AppChoices app to function properly, your “Limit Ad Tracking” device setting must not be selected.  Interest-Based Advertising data previously collected or received in association with the replaced advertising ID will not be used via Xaxis for Interest-Based Advertising on any other device or browser that we have reasonably linked to the mobile app environment where the information was collected.  In addition, if we have actual knowledge that another device or browser is linked to the opted-out mobile app environment, that other device or browser will also be opted out from receiving Interest-Based Advertising via Xaxis.  Additional information regarding the AppChoices app is available at [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.).



Additional information regarding user choice in application environments is available at www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.

 **Network Advertising Initiative**  

We are a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to the NAI’s Codes of Conduct in those markets where these self-regulatory frameworks apply and are in effect.  In accordance with the Codes of Conduct, we require our Xaxis Marketplace (formerly Xaxis Publisher Network and 24/7 Access) clients to inform users about their privacy and information collection practices via their privacy policies and to include in their privacy policies information regarding the use of third-party advertising technology and services on their Sites, the types of data collected through these services, the use and distribution of that data, and a link to an industry standard opt-out from Interest-Based Advertising.  We periodically monitor the Sites of our clients to determine whether they are adequately disclosing and updating their privacy statements.

We fully support the digital advertising industry’s efforts to increase transparency in the area of Interest-Based Advertising and health segments.  For more information on standard interest segments based on health-related information or interests that we may use for Interest-Based Advertising purposes, please click [here](http://www.xaxis.com/static/view/consumer-interest-segments).

 **Digital Advertising Alliance, European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, and Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada**

We are a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) and, in connection with such memberships, adhere to the [DAA Self-Regulatory Principles](http://www.aboutads.info/principles), the [IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising](http://www.edaa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2013-11-11-IAB-Europe-OBA-Framework_.pdf), and the [DAAC’s Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising](http://youradchoices.ca/files/DAAC-ThePrinciples.pdf), respectively, in those markets where such applicable self-regulatory framework applies.

 **Children’s Privacy**

Neither the Services nor the Xaxis Web Site is developed for, or directed at, children (as defined by applicable law) or at Sites primarily directed to children.  We do not knowingly collect information from children.  If you believe a child has provided us with personal information and you would like to have the information removed, please contact us at [privacy@xaxis.com](mailto:privacy@xaxis.com).

 **Transfer of Data in the Event of Acquisition**

In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, corporate reorganization, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any information a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to the acquiring party.

 **Information Security**

We follow generally accepted online advertising industry standards to protect against unauthorized access to, unlawful processing of, unauthorized retention of, and unauthorized disclosure of data.  These standards include undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.  Please keep in mind, however, that despite these efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect such data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security in relation to any such data.

We are a global company and therefore we may transfer data to countries around the world, including countries outside your country or your continent.  We will, where necessary, put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure such data is protected.

 **Data Retention**

We generally maintain the information we collect through our Services in non-aggregated form for a period of not more than 13 months.  This data includes Sites visited, content viewed, ad interactions, IP addresses (please see the “IP Address” subsection below for additional information), browser type and language settings.

We may maintain information we collect through our Services in an aggregated form for a period longer than 13 months.

 **IP Address**

Please note that in some countries an IP address is considered personal data by applicable law.  If we collect information from any such country and we know that you are located in that country, we will treat your IP address as personal data.

For those countries we interpose a “black box” that is operated by an independent third party and that separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect.  As a result of this black box, IP addresses for those countries do not touch Xaxis’s systems and are not processed by Xaxis in connection with the provision of Services.
