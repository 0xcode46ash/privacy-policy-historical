If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service, we will collect additional specific personal information, including your credit card number and billing address, in order to create a Xactware billing account.

Xactware currently uses the services of an online partner to help us measure how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our partner on this site. The type of information we collect includes pages visited, visitor trends, etc. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, etc. Although our partner manages the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.

Xactware uses your specific personal information to inform you of other products or services available from Xactware and its affiliates. Xactware may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Xactware does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Xactware may hire other companies to provide services on its behalf, such as providing customer support. Xactware will only provide those companies the specific personal information they need to deliver the service. Such third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of your specific personal information and are prohibited from using such information for any other purpose.

Xactware may access and / or disclose your specific personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Xactware or the website; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Xactware, including its family of websites.

Xactware is committed to protecting the security of your specific personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your specific personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the specific personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.
