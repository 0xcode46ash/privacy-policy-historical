## Privacy Statement

Xactly Corporation ("Xactly" or "we") has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. Privacy on the www.xactlycorp.com Web Site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Since we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. In an effort to ensure the highest levels of data privacy our standards meet the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbor" standards. If you have any questions regarding this policy please contact us via email at [privacy@xactlycorp.com](mailto:privacy@xactlycorp.com).

## Collected Information

In order to access certain portions of the Site, you will be required to register by providing certain limited information regarding you and the company you represent. Xactly may use the information that we collect to contact visitors to further discuss their interest in our company and to send information regarding our company, such as newsletters and events. Visitor email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties under any circumstance. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to [marketing@xactlycorp.com](mailto:marketing@xactlycorp.com). If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Xactly will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Xactly will not send the friend any additional information, unless they choose to register themselves.

## Cookies

When you interact with the xactlycorp.com Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our Web server may send a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Xactly either by requesting a download or registering for a demo or webinar, you remain anonymous to Xactly. If you do not accept cookies from the domain "xactlycorp.com", you cannot access certain portions of the Site without registering again each time you would like to access restricted information.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses that we collect are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Users Outside of the United States

While we make every effort to honor the laws and wishes of all users, this Site is available for users located primarily in the United States of America and therefore may not recognize foreign laws.

## Security

Xactly takes substantial precautions to protect data and information under its control from misuse, loss or alteration. We utilize some of the most advanced technology available today for Internet security and are constantly taking measures to adjust to the changing security landscape. As such, Xactly maintains layered, defense in-depth security measures, including hosting our solution in a Tier IV (the highest recognized level) datacenter, to allow only authorized personnel access to your information. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security, and Xactly disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Site.

## Links to Third-Party Sites

The Site contains links to external web sites. Xactly is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these external web sites. Visitors are therefore advised to check the policy statements of linked web sites to understand their policies. Depending on those policies, customers and visitors who access a linked site may potentially disclose private information. It is the sole responsibility of the users to keep such information private and confidential.
