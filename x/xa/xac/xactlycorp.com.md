In order to access certain portions of the Site, you will be required to register by providing certain limited information regarding you and the company you represent such as name, email address, address and phone number. Xactly may use the information that we collect to contact visitors to further discuss their interest in our company, when you register for a webinar or other informational offering, and to send information regarding our company, such as newsletters and events.

## Cookies

When you interact with the xactlycorp.com Site and Platform, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site and Platform, our Web server may send a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer’s hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Xactly either by requesting a download or registering for a demo or webinar, you remain anonymous to Xactly. If you do not accept cookies from the domain “xactlycorp.com”, you cannot access certain portions of the Site or Platform without registering again each time you would like to access restricted information.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers on the Site is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

## Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses that we collect are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Clear Gifs

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

## Advertising

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## Social Media Features

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Users Outside of the United States

While we make every effort to honor the laws and wishes of all users, this Site is available for users located primarily in the United States of America and therefore may or may not address privacy requirements contained in non-domestic legislation.

## Security

Xactly takes substantial precautions to protect data and information under its control from misuse, loss or alteration. We utilize some of the most advanced technology available today for Internet security and are constantly taking measures to adjust to the changing security landscape. As such, Xactly maintains layered, defense in-depth security measures, including hosting our solution in a Tier IV (the highest recognized level) datacenter, to allow only authorized personnel access to your information. When you provide us with sensitive information (such as your login credentials) we transmit your personal information via SSL encryption. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security, and Xactly disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Site. If you have any questions regarding security on our web site, you can contact us at support@xactlycorp.com.
