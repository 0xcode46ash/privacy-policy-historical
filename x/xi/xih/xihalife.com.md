# Privacy policy

**Xiha Online Privacy policy**

Xiha respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and we are committed to protecting the personal information that we collect about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this privacy policy to guide how we collect, store, and use information that you provide us online.

**What does this Privacy Policy apply to?**

The website you are currently visiting is operated by Xiha Ltd ("Xiha"). This privacy policy applies to this and other websites operated by Xiha.

This privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through Xiha websites, and does not apply to information that we may collect offline. In addition, this privacy policy does not extend to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of any website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site.

Please note that your use this website signifies your agreement to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please discontinue use of our websites. Xiha reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy and you are encouraged to check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our websites signifies your acceptance of these changes.

**What types of information do you collect?**

In order to give you the best experience on our websites, we may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any the following: Website and game-specific registration; Newsletter subscription; General support; Product support; Online store; Contests and other promotions; Polls, surveys, or questionnaires; or other such features or services provided via our websites.

The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities depends on the activity. Requested personal information may include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address and (for those purchasing products online) credit card information including billing and shipping addresses. For some activities, you may need to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity requiring personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below.

No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**How do we use the information we collect?**

Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information collected from those who register on our websites is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter or access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions). And, of course, any credit card information is solely used to fulfill and process purchase orders. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, we will use your information to provide them to you.

We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to this privacy policy, new areas or features on our websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.

We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to you?**

If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our websites and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you may not be able to receive general support or product support. To simply browse our websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.

**Do you use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?**

**Cookies:** We may use cookies to improve the use and functionality of our websites. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our websites. For example, cookies will remember what you've placed in your shopping cart, tell us that you have visited one of our websites before, and may contain other information that will make your next visit to our websites more enjoyable. We may combine information contained in cookies with your personal information. You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to use our websites.

**IP Addresses:** We may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

**Log Files:** We may collect information in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.

**Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?**

Information that you disclose on our websites is collected by us, or on our behalf; and is used in accordance with the practices set forth above. Entities that provide support for the internal operations of our websites may only use the information we share with them (or that they collect on our behalf) for purposes of internal fulfillment (e.g., online product fulfillment) and are required to handle such information in accordance with this privacy policy.

From time to time, we may run contests, tournaments, or other events or activities on our websites. Information collected for these events may include personal information such as your email address and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, software licensee, or game developer). While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect through our websites). If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the time the information is collected.

We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, our customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign.

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

If you do not want to receive our newsletter, service related announcements, or any other communications and/or services from us, please send us email and notify us that you would like to opt-out from these communications or services. We will immediatelly stop sending you further communications. See below for contact information.

**What is your policy regarding children under 13?**

We do not knowingly collect personal information such as name and email address from children under 13 years old on our websites. We take steps to ensure that those who wish to register or submit personal information on our websites meet certain age requirements before they can do so. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.

From time to time, our websites may allow children under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first telling us their age or getting their parent? permission. Such portions of our websites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent.

**What safeguards do you use to protect my personal information?**

We take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors. Personal information collected by us is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

Although we cannot guarantee that third parties to whom we transfer personal data will adhere to the security standards set forth above, we will take reasonable measures to assure that they provide sufficient protection over such data.
