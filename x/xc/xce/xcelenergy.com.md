     •   When personal information may be shared with third parties, and
     •   Security of information.
Your Web Site Visits and Information We Collect
You do not need to provide any personal information to visit public sections of this website. In order to
ensure that we provide the best possible service to our customers, our web servers automatically collect
usage data such as Internet provider addresses, browser types and access times. We then evaluate
these website statistics, so that we can improve our service to our customers.
A Special Note for Parents
For the safety and privacy of the children who visit our website, no personally identifiable information such

Usage of Collected Information
We use industry standard software to create summary statistics of the website usage data we collect,
which may then be used to highlight what our visitors find interesting, to improve the website design
specifications, to identify system performance issues and for other internal purposes.
We may use information we collect to assist in diagnoses of problems with our servers and to administer
the website and Communications Channels. Data gathered from logging this information is not tied to
your personal information and is not used to identify you. The information we use for this purpose may
include browser type, IP address, pages viewed and other non-personally identifiable information.
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive by web page servers. When you visit
the website, our server may create cookies, making it more convenient for you to use the website by
verifying when you travel from page to page. Data on the website usage we collect using cookies is not
tied to your personal information and is only used in aggregate form.


Information You Submit
If you register to access various services related to your residential account or other applications involving
your business account on the website, you may be asked to complete online registration forms and
submit personal information such as your Xcel Energy account number, name, address, partial or full
Social Security Number, phone number, e-mail address, residential or business customer, type of
business, payment method, energy usage data and personal preference information. You may be asked

buttons,” or other methods to verify your identity. You also may be asked to submit, or you may elect to
submit, additional personal information or financial information in order to use certain specific services
offered in these customer account transaction areas.
How We Use Your Information
The personal information you provide not only enables you to access various customer services offered
on the website and through other Electronic Communications, but it also enables us to provide you with
better service generally. We may use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry that you
send to Xcel Energy or to keep you informed about Xcel Energy and its services. If you choose to
communicate with Xcel Energy by e-mail, then e-mail from Xcel Energy to you will be considered to be
sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has access to your e-mail. Online service
commitments may require follow-up contacts such as telephone call-backs and response regarding the
services to be utilized, including billings and payments.
We collect e-mail addresses to improve our service to our customers. In some cases, we may contact
you to let you know about new products or services. If you do not wish to be contacted by us for this
purpose, or you believe you are receiving our communications in error or no longer want to receive them,
you may provide this request by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any e-mail from Xcel Energy
marketing a product or service. We will discontinue this type of contact with you within 10 days after we
receive your e-mail.
We request that you protect the confidentiality of any User ID and password you use to access any of
your services online. You are responsible for all activity on the website accessed by your User ID and
password. Access by the company’s employees or consultants to any personal information you provide is
limited only to information necessary to provide the business service offered and to allow employees or
consultants to perform their duties to Xcel Energy.
To provide you with services offered on the website, or to complete transactions or requests you initiated
on the website or other Electronic Communication, we may transfer you to outside services provided by
third-party operators. In certain instances, the third-party content may be “framed” in such a way that it
appears you are still on Xcel Energy’s website. In such cases, we will have agreements with those third
parties whose websites you may be transferred to, under which the third parties agree to maintain the
confidentiality of your personal information and to use it only to help us serve you.
Links
While browsing the website, you may encounter hypertext links to other third-party operated websites.
These other third-party websites may send their own cookies to you, log your IP address, and otherwise
collect data or solicit personal information. XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT CONTROL AND IS NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THIRD PARTIES DO IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR WEBSITES, OR
HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION AND
CONSULT THE PRIVACY POLICIES POSTED ON EACH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE FOR FURTHER
INFORMATION.

Sharing Information with Third Parties
Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your
written consent (which consent may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably
believe the disclosure is essential to the conduct of the company’s business or to provide services to you.
Situations where these disclosures may become necessary include, but are not limited to (i) compliance
with the law, legal process or our regulators; (ii) collection of unpaid bills; (iii) enabling the company’s
employees or consultants to provide service to you and to otherwise perform their duties; (iv) compliance
with interchange functions; (v) obtaining and providing credit reporting information; or (vi) resolution of
customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your personal information to third parties for
telemarketing, e-mail or direct mail solicitation. When we contract with another company to market or
advertise products for Xcel Energy, we require that those companies also protect your personal
information.
Other circumstances in which we share your personal information with third parties include the following:
     •   With your documented consent,
     •   Pursuant to a valid warrant, subpoena or court order,
     •   To existing or prospective customers, tenants, property owners or real estate agents requesting
         average residential energy consumption,
     •   If you have authorized a third-party agreement in which you designated that a third party will
         receive your energy usage information, bill or copies of any notice of discontinuance sent
         regarding your account (for example, sharing information concerning an elderly parent’s billing
         arrangement with an adult caregiver),
     •   For the business purposes of Xcel Energy (for example, sharing information with third parties who
         assist us with the provision of services to customers, such as electronic billing, online energy
         audits, or processing online or credit card payments),
     •   For purposes of investigating or completing a merger or acquisition, sale of one of our businesses
         or business units, or in connection with a business reorganization, and
     •   Where required by applicable law.
Security of Information
Conducting Our Business
Our policies and procedures limit access to personal information to those with a business reason to know

your account and other personal information during online transactions. However, we cannot guarantee
the confidentiality or security of your browser or any communication transmitted or accessible over the
Internet. Our server will run detection software to help ensure you are using a secure browser and your
personal or financial information is secure when you make a transaction. If the software determines you
are not using a secure browser, then a message will appear at checkout. You may then make the
decision as to whether to continue or not.
