Xcel Energy Inc., its wholly owned affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Xcel Energy”)

Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices.

      How you can ask questions about our privacy practices and seek resolution of any

       assets that you access

The types of information we may obtain about you include:

         media
        User name or ID and password for an account you may establish on our websites

                 to the customer of record before providing account access or taking action on
                 the account, and to aid our ability to collect on past-due debts.
             o In Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico, with your permission, we may also use
                 your SSN to obtain a credit indicator from a consumer reporting agency to

                 residential service you request. We do not obtain full credit reports or credit
                 scores from consumer reporting agencies when establishing residential
                 service.

Online Advertising
You may see ads about our products and services on other websites because we participate in
advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through
demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks track your online activities
over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of
cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. The ad network vendors may
collect information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising
networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on
the sites. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for our products and
services. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-
party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the
effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Information Disclosures
Overview
We do not disclose information about you except as described in this Privacy Policy. This
means that, with the exception of disclosures of the information described in this Policy and
any disclosures you or your authorized agent have specifically authorized, you can expect
that we will keep the information that we maintain about you private or confidential, and not
otherwise disclose it.
As we explain in the next section, certain disclosures of information about you do not require
your consent because they are specifically permitted or required by applicable laws and
regulations. Other disclosures will only occur after we obtain your explicit authorization.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy precludes you from directly sharing your own information
with a third party that may or may not be affiliated with Xcel Energy. In such circumstances,


Xcel Energy is not responsible for unauthorized disclosure or use of that information by the
third party to which you disclose your information.
Information Disclosures for Which Authorization Is Not Required
We may disclose information about you as required or permitted by law or applicable
regulations, including to a federal, state or local governmental agency with the power to
compel such disclosure, or in response to a subpoena or court order.
We may disclose information about you to service providers who perform services on our
behalf, such as companies that assist us in providing products and services to customers,
billing customers, or processing credit card payments. We prohibit these service providers
from using or disclosing the information we provide them, except as necessary to perform
specific services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.
Except for the instances listed in this section, we will not disclose to third parties your Social
Security Number, banking or credit card information, driver license number, credit reporting
information, bankruptcy or probate information.
We may disclose aggregated or de-identified energy usage data to third parties. We aggregate
and/or anonymize the information in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory
requirements, including those designed to prevent the re-identification of the information.
We also reserve the right to disclose information about you in connection with: (1) referral of
past due accounts for collection or sale of such accounts; or (2) a transfer of service rights to
another utility provider (which would generally be subject to your state Public Utility or
Public Service Commission review and approval). Should such a sale, merger or transfer
occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the recipient to use information you have
provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. Following such a sale,
merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your information with
any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
Information Disclosures that Require Customer Authorization
We may share certain information about you with a third party if you have previously
authorized the disclosure in writing, including:
        Energy Usage Data – The following links provide access to our Energy Usage Data
         release authorization forms:
             o Colorado Customers - Electric Energy Usage Data Release Form
             o Colorado Customers - Natural Gas or Steam Energy Usage Data Release
             o Customers in Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South
                 Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin – Electric and Natural Gas Energy Usage Data
                 Release Form
        Requests for disclosure of customer information other than Energy Usage Data:
             o Service Verification Letters
             o Credit Reference Letters

                 disconnection dates, explanation of a payment arrangement, confirmation that
                 the account is current, recap of a phone call, etc. Custom letters typically
                 include the customer’s name, account number, service address, and alternate
                 mailing address (when applicable)
             o The following link provides access to our One-Time Release of Information
                 (other than Customer Energy Usage Data)
Prior to authorizing the disclosure of your information to a third party, you should consider
the third party’s proposed scope, purpose, and use of the information – including whether
they can use it for other purposes that may extend beyond the purpose for which you initially
authorized its disclosure.
With respect to disclosures of Customer Energy Usage Data, please note that, depending on
the type of metering equipment and supporting infrastructure, it may be possible to obtain
insight into activities within your home or business through analysis of Energy Usage Data.
If you decline a request from a third party to authorize access to your Energy Usage Data,
that decision will not affect the provision of any service you receive from Xcel Energy.
