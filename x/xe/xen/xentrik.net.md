# Xentrik | Privacy Policy

Because protecting your privacy is very important to _Xentrik_ , we operate this website under the following guidelines, to safeguard your personally identifiable information:

**What personal information does _Xentrik_ collect?**  
_Xentrik_ asks when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). For example, _Xentrik_ asks for your name and e-mail address when you use the [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact.php). We also collect information about your navigation of our site, the type of operating system you use, and your IP address. From time to time, we may collect additional information for surveys or other promotions sponsored by _Xentrik_ and/or its promotional partners. We use this information to operate our services, to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic information.

**What are cookies and how does _Xentrik_ use them?**  
_Xentrik_ may place a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. The information can be retrieved to personalize, monitor, or regulate use of the site. Cookies allow _Xentrik_ to automate access and data entry functions of the site, such as login information and to tailor the site to a user's preferences or interests. In addition, cookies allow _Xentrik_ to track usage of the site to determine those areas of the site that are useful or popular (and those that are not), thereby enabling _Xentrik_ to improve and update its service.

**Will _Xentrik_ ever send me direct mailings?**  
No. The only time you will ever receive any kind of mail from _Xentrik_ is when you contact us first, requiring a reply. We do not send out promotional messages of any kind.

**How do I protect my Personal Information in public forums?**  
_Xentrik_ may at times offer interactive forums, such as messages boards and chat. _Xentrik_ users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information to other users or to third parties on the _Xentrik_ website, that information can be collected and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from other members or third parties. While _Xentrik_ strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to _Xentrik_ , and you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any personal information.

**What about privacy on sites that _Xentrik_ links to?**  
_Xentrik_ may provide links to other Internet sites or partners. These sites have separate data and privacy practices independent of _Xentrik_ , and we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.

**Will _Xentrik_ share my personal information with any third parties?**  
_Xentrik_ will NOT disclose any Personal Information, except as described in this policy. _Xentrik_ may disclose user information, including demographic data, in 3 instances only: 1) in an aggregated form that does not identify individual users in order to describe its services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes; 2) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; and/or 3) to protect the rights or property of _Xentrik_ or its visitors.

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, or if you believe _Xentrik_ has not adhered to these principles, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.php).
