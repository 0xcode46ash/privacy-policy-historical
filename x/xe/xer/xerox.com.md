# Xerox Corporation Privacy Policy

  


**This is the Privacy Policy of the Xerox Corporation in the United States.**

This privacy statement covers the Web pages belonging to the Xerox Corporation in the United States. It does not cover the privacy policies of Xerox [affiliates](http://www.xerox.com/about-xerox/privacy-policy/exceptions/enus.html).

At Xerox, privacy on the Internet means that: 

  * Xerox informs you how we use any personally identifiable information that is submitted to us online
  * Xerox maintains confidentiality and security safeguards for personally identifiable information
  * You have control over the personally identifiable information you decide to submit to Xerox
  * If you have elected to receive email promotions from Xerox, you can opt-out from these at any time



 **It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information when you visit the Xerox Web site.**

When you visit the a Xerox website, you have the opportunity to contact Xerox online -- to ask a question, to learn more about a product, or to ask for help with a product you already have. If you choose to contact Xerox online, you will find that our online forms ask for common types of personally identifiable information, such as name, phone number, e-mail address, or product serial number. We ask for this information to help us reply to you. 

Xerox maintains the information it receives online in strict confidence; information you submit to Xerox is not sold to or shared with third parties, except to our agents and partners as described below. 

Xerox reserves the right to notify its customers about administrative matters that pertain to their Xerox accounts. When required by law, Xerox will share information with government agencies. Although we do not currently anticipate a change in our corporate status, in the event of a merger or acquisition of the company or a substantial portion of its assets, Xerox may disclose, transfer or sell personal information collected online to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively. Personal information collected online will remain subject to promises made in this Online Privacy Policy. 

If you would like to contact Xerox without submitting personally identifiable information online, you can reach a Xerox representative by calling the Xerox hotline at 1-800-ASK-XEROX. 

**Xerox is authorized to display the BBBOnline Accredited Business Seal.**

The BBBOnline Accredited Business Seal reflects Xerox Corporation’s adherence to the BBB’s Code of Business Practices.

On the Xerox website, we offer online shopping and other Web-based customer services. Our online forms make it easy for visitors and customers to communicate with Xerox or make purchases. Those who want to communicate with Xerox but do not wish to give personally identifiable information online may use the phone or fax numbers that we also provide on our Web pages.

 **Xerox asks only for the minimum amount of information needed to assist you.**

Most online forms on the Xerox site ask for a small amount of relevant information, such as name, email, street address, and phone number. Some forms may ask for customer number or product serial number. Xerox uses personally identifiable information submitted online to: 

  * respond to questions from customers or visitors to the website
  * provide customer support
  * share product news, updates, or helpful tips about Xerox products
  * enable online shopping
  * inform users of special promotions
  * sign up for online services
  * create reseller partnerships



Xerox does not direct any part of its website to children under 13 years old and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. 

Personally identifiable information that is submitted in a business capacity may be merged with available business data base directories. 

while we at Xerox are pleased to offer convenient services and shopping options online in the United States, we are also mindful to protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information we receive. 

**Our agents and partners protect personally identifiable information.**

When a customer purchases equipment or supplies or arranges for service online from Xerox it may be necessary to transfer personally identifiable information to an independent Xerox-authorized agent or partner, who then fills the order. Xerox requires that its independent agents and partners handle personally identifiable information with the same concern for personal privacy as Xerox. 

Whenever Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to its agents and partners, it is with the understanding that the information should be used for the sole purpose of fulfilling the customer's request and that the information should be kept confidential and secure at all times. 

In some instances, when Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to one of its authorized agents or partners, that agent or partner may need to share information with an unaffiliated third party for the purpose of completing an order or providing a service. 

**Xerox gets your consent before sending you additional information.**

Xerox may send commercial email to customers who have expressed an interest in its products and services. If you contact Xerox over the Web, you can choose to receive commercial email or opt-out of such email by using the checkbox provided on our Web forms. Some forms on our site have no opt-out box. That is because those forms are "reply only" forms used only to respond to your particular request. If you receive commercial email from Xerox and wish to discontinue these mailings, you may unsubscribe at [www.xerox.com/unsubscribe](http://www.xerox.com/perl-bin/formeng.pl?form=2680_email_pref&XOGlang=en_US).

**Xerox maintains strict access control over personally identifiable information.**

Only authorized Xerox personnel, agents, and partners are allowed to handle information submitted to Xerox online.

Xerox Corporation in the United States stores personally identifiable information in password-protected environments on servers that are located in the United States. These servers are subject to Xerox's information security policies, standards, and procedures. 

**Credit card data is encrypted.**

To ensure that online shoppers in the United States can purchase with confidence from the Xerox website, Xerox protects credit card information with industry-standard encryption technology. When a customer submits an order to Xerox online, the personal and credit card information is used only to complete the purchase and arrange for shipping. Customers who opt-out of additional announcements will not receive unsolicited email. 

Individuals may contact Xerox to check the accuracy of their own personally identifiable information or to request that the information be updated or deleted by writing to ethics@xerox.com. Please indicate "Access" in the subject line and let us know the details of your request in the body of the message. You may also contact us at the Xerox Ethics and Privacy Hotline at 1-866-XRX-0001.
