# Xerox - USA - Corporate - Privacy

| **This is the Privacy Policy of the Xerox Corporation in the United States.**

Xerox cares about protecting the privacy of individuals who visit the Xerox Web site for information, products, and services. This policy explains how we at Xerox ensure the responsible use and protection of any personally identifiable information that we receive online. 

Xerox understands the importance of personal privacy online. 

Xerox has developed its Web site with personal privacy in mind. At Xerox, privacy on the Internet means that: 

  * you have control over any personally identifiable information you decide to submit to Xerox 
  * Xerox informs you how we use any personally identifiable information that is submitted to us online 
  * Xerox is committed to treating your information confidentially at all times. 

**It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information when you visit the Xerox Web site.**

You can browse the Xerox Web site without disclosing any information that identifies you as an individual ("personally identifiable information"). Xerox provides you with the opportunity to contact Xerox online--to ask a question, learn more about a product, or to ask for help with a product you already have. If you choose to contact Xerox online, you will find that many of our contact forms ask for common types of personally identifiable information, such as name, street address, and e-mail address. We ask for this information to help us reply to you. 

Providing personally identifiable information is voluntary. Xerox always leaves it up to you whether to submit personally identifiable information online. If you would like to contact Xerox, but do not wish to submit personally identifiable information online, you can reach a Xerox representative by calling the Xerox hotline at 1-800-ASK-XEROX. 

As an optional benefit when visiting the Xerox Web site, you may customize your Xerox online visits in the area of the site called My Xerox. If you register to use My Xerox, you will be required to submit your e-mail address before proceeding further. However, if you do not wish to register with My Xerox, you will still be able to view all the contents of the Xerox Web site. 

**Our privacy practices have been approved by BBB _OnLine_ Â®.**

Xerox Corporation in the United States is a founding sponsor of the Better Business Bureau OnLine. We proudly display the BBB _OnLine_ 's Privacy Seal as our assurance to you that we value your privacy.

 **The Privacy Seal represents strong standards in protecting personally identifiable information.**

The BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Seal on the Xerox Web site indicates that Xerox is committed to protecting any personally identifiable information submitted to Xerox online. As a participant in the BBB _OnLine_ 's Privacy Program, Xerox complies with the BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Dispute Resolution Program.

|  **We bring you the benefits of information and shopping at Internet speed.**

During your visit to the Xerox site, you will find that we offer online shopping and customer services on selected Web pages. To handle online orders or inquiries more efficiently, Xerox has provided electronic forms that request personally identifiable information such as name, street address, and e-mail address. These forms enable visitors and customers to communicate with Xerox quickly and easily. As an alternative, those who want to communicate with Xerox but do not wish to give personally identifiable information online may use the phone or fax numbers that we also provide on our Web pages.

 **Xerox asks only for the minimum amount of information needed to assist you.**

Xerox uses personally identifiable information submitted online to:

  * respond to questions from customers or visitors to the Web site
  * provide customer support
  * share product news, updates, or helpful tips about Xerox products
  * enable online shopping
  * inform users of special promotions
  * create reseller partnerships.

When we request personally identifiable information, we limit our request to the information needed to respond to inquiries or complete a transaction. Once you send information online to Xerox, your information is used only for the specific purpose for which it was submitted.

Personally identifiable information that is submitted in a business capacity may be merged with available business data base directories.

 **Here are the types of information that Xerox collects:**

 _Contact and feedback forms_ : Anyone with questions or comments may use these electronic forms to submit inquiries to our Webmaster or to specific Xerox business groups. If an individual wants to communicate with Xerox through the Web site, we require a sufficient amount of information to respond to the individual's request. Xerox replies to contact and feedback forms only once, unless a customer requests follow-up or additional assistance with a particular problem. If a customer contacts Xerox online with a request that requires specific or regional expertise, the request will be forwarded to a local, Xerox-authorized representative for handling. 

_Commerce forms_ : To process orders over the Internet in the United States, Xerox asks for purchase and shipping information--name, address, phone and credit card numbers. Xerox uses credit card numbers only to process specific orders for equipment and supplies. 

  
_Subscription forms_ : By subscribing to e-mail news and updates, customers get the benefit of the latest tips and information about specific Xerox products. A subscriber can request that his or her name be removed from the mailing list by sending an e-mail to webmaster@xerox.com.

 _Registration forms_ : Using the Xerox Web site, customers can register Xerox products and activate warranties online. Our online registration forms ask for name, address, machine serial number and some customer satisfaction data. Registering online also entitles the customer to the option of receiving product news and featured promotions by e-mail in the future. Customers can choose not to receive these additional e-mail contacts by clicking a designated opt-out box at the time of registration. Customers who have elected to receive news and promotions may request that these contacts be discontinued at any time by sending an e-mail to webmaster@xerox.com. For those who do not wish to register online, the registration Web pages also have details on how to register by phone, fax, or mail.

_Download forms_ : Visitors to the Xerox Web site can download free evaluation copies of software by completing and submitting a download form. These forms ask for personally identifiable information.

 _Reseller forms_ : Resellers interested in becoming Xerox partners can submit information through the Xerox Web site.

|  **Xerox keeps personally identifiable information confidential.**

While we at Xerox are pleased to offer convenient services and shopping options online in the United States, we are also mindful of our responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information we receive. 

**Our agents and partners protect personally identifiable information.**

When a customer purchases equipment or supplies online from Xerox it may be necessary to transfer personally identifiable information to an independent Xerox-authorized agent or partner, who then fills the order. Xerox requires that its independent agents and partners handle personally identifiable information with the same concern for personal privacy as Xerox. 

Whenever Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to its agents and partners, it is with the understanding that the information should be used for the sole purpose of fulfilling the customer's request and that the information should be kept confidential and secure at all times. 

In some instances, when Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to one of its authorized agents or partners, that agent or partner may need to share the personally identifiable information with an unaffiliated third party for the purpose of completing an order or providing a service. Information will be shared with outside parties only at your request. You can instruct a Xerox agent not to share your information. 

**Xerox gets your consent before sending you additional information.**

Xerox may wish to contact you with announcements about products and services that we believe will be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these announcements, you can click an opt-out box on the appropriate Xerox Web page before submitting your information. If a Xerox Web page does not have an opt-out box, that means no additional announcements will be sent to you. You can unsubscribe from announcements by sending an e-mail with a description or copy of the announcement to webmaster@xerox.com. 

**About links to non-Xerox Web sites.**

While visiting the Xerox Web site, you may encounter links that take you to the Web site of another organization, such as a retailer that offers related services. Xerox posts these links as a way of helping you locate related information and services easily. However, when clicking to a non-Xerox Web site, please know that non-Xerox web sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy and these other companies may not treat personally identifiable information with the same privacy protections as Xerox. To find out how another company handles the information it receives online, please check the Privacy Policy posted on that company's Web site.

|  **Only authorized Xerox personnel or agents are allowed to handle personally identifiable information submitted to Xerox online.**

Any personally identifiable information that Xerox maintains is stored in password-protected, secure environments that can be accessed only by authorized personnel. Xerox instructs all personnel who handle personally identifiable information to use appropriate privacy and security precautions when processing this information. 

**Credit card data is encrypted.**

To ensure that online shoppers in the United States can purchase with confidence from the Xerox Web site, Xerox protects credit card and shipping information with industry-standard encryption technology. Just as Xerox is careful with your personally identifiable information, we likewise observe rigorous privacy protection standards when handling credit card and financial data. When a customer submits an order to Xerox online, the personal and credit card information is used only to complete the purchase and arrange for shipping. This information is not used subsequently for marketing or unsolicited contacts.

| **Reviewing personally identifiable information submitted to Xerox online.**

Individuals may contact Xerox to check the accuracy of their own personally identifiable information or to request that the information be updated or deleted by writing to webmaster@xerox.com 

**Xerox will verify the identity of individuals requesting access to their information.**

To prevent fraudulent access to the personally identifiable information stored by Xerox, each Xerox business group takes appropriate measures to verify the identity of each person requesting review, change or deletion of his or her personally identifiable information.

| **What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file that a Web site puts on a user's hard disk. This file identifies specific information about previous visits to the Web site. 

**How does Xerox use cookies?**

Xerox uses cookies to recognize repeat visits to our Web site and to facilitate Web navigation and online shopping. The cookie stores the user's country, language, and segmentation preferences, and an assigned random session ID. Cookies identify the user's session, so that online shoppers and other persons using the Web to communicate with Xerox do not have to enter the same information in multiple locations. 

The cookie information that Xerox collects helps us track the number of visitors to the Web site over time and determine whether these were new or repeat visits. Xerox tracks cookie information to better understand patterns of usage by Web visitors. Xerox uses this information to adjust the presentation of our Web site and to make it more relevant to our users.
