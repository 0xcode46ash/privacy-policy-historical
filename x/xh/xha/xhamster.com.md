  * ## V. How We Use Your Information

    1. The primary use for Your information is to provide You with services You have requested. We use the information We collect from You to maintain, protect and improve xHamster, to develop new services on the website, and to protect xHamster and our users. We also use this information to offer You tailored content ‚Äì like giving you more relevant search results, customized content and ads. Member login information and e-mail addresses may be disclosed to our partner projects, which include but not limited to [xhamsterlive.com](https://xhamsterlive.com/) & [xhamsterpremium.com](https://xhamsterpremium.com/) for the purpose of providing certain features. Member login information and e-mail addresses may be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of providing certain features or third-party upgrades as requested by the Member. We are not responsible for how third parties use your information, and You should become familiar with such third parties‚Äô privacy policies prior to requesting their services. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively is used in order to customize Our marketing efforts or to customize the use of Our Site for an aggregate group of customers. We additionally may use the personal information of Users whose membership has expired or has been cancelled in order to market Our services to these individuals in the future.   
We generally will use Your information for the purposes for which You specifically provide it. We also use Your information for market research purposes ‚Äì in order to increase Your (and other Users‚Äô) experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target potential new markets, and for other marketing purposes.  
We also use Your information for the obvious purpose of providing Your User profile to all of Our other Members and Browsers. When You create a profile, You should consider all of the information on the profile to be public information, accessible by anyone, unless otherwise stated. Even if You choose to not make public Your personally identifying information, You should understand that there is a possibility that You may be identified through information You provide on Your profile. For example, You may be visually recognized by someone who sees Your picture or Your description may be adequately detailed that someone browsing the Site would be able to tell that the person is You. Accordingly, You understand that using this Site places You in control of all of the information displayed on Your profile, and You are fully responsible for any consequences arising out of such information You choose to publish. 
  * ## VI. Special Cases

    1.

      5. If We have reason to believe that the User is not the owner of a credit card, even if the credit card use is authorized, We will provide information about You to the credit card holder. We will absolutely provide Your information to the credit card holder if We believe that fraud is a possibility. However, We do not require that there be fraud, as it is Our policy that the credit card holder always has an absolute right to access any and all of Your personal information.
      6. Anyone who violates Our Anti-Spam Policy, if applicable, shall have their personal information made public. If there is any investigation on any unlawful spamming, or any use of bulk e-mail in order to promote Your User profile, or any use of bulk e-mail in any manner that leads back to Our Site, or any one of Our Sites, We will cooperate with any and all parties completely and freely in order to see that Your bulk e-mail activities stop.
