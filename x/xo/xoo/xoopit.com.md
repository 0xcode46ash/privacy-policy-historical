# Xoopit - Privacy Policy

This Policy was last modified December, 2008. 

Xoopit, Inc. ("Xoopit," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Xoopit when you use xoopit.com and related services (the "Site"), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

If you have questions about the Privacy Policy or would like to suggest improvements, please contact us at [privacy@xoopit.com](mailto:privacy@xoopit.com). 

##  Information We Collect 

**User-Provided Information:** You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and email address, company name, city, country, zip code, postal mailing address, etc, when you register with the Site or respond to certain offers on the Site. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. 

**Cookies Information:** When you visit xoopit.com or other websites we own or operate, we may send one or more cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Xoopit help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. Xoopit uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

**Log File Information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. 

## How We Use Your Information

We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Site. 

## Emails and Content You Store on Xoopit and Automatically Recorded Information

Xoopit does not claim any ownership in any of the content, including any text, data, information, images, photographs, music, sound, video or other material that you upload, transmit or store in you xoopit account. Such content will remain your private information. Xoopit's servers will automatically scan and record certain information regarding email accounts you load on Xoopit and your use of the Site—such as account activity and other log information. The automatically recorded information will be processed for various purposes, including formatting and displaying the information you transmit via your emails. Such automatically recorded information shall remain your private information and will not be made available to the public. 

**User-posted Information:** Unlike the automatically scanned and recorded information contained in any emails you send through the Site, which we agree will remain your private information, any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Site (for instance, in the text, data, photos, audio, video, images, graphics, links, logos, votes, and other content or materials ("Materials") you post to public areas of the Site) becomes available to the public. 

By providing Xoopit your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Site-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the Site and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to [support@xoopit.com](mailto:support@xoopit.com) with the subject "No email" or by sending mail to the following postal address: 

> Customer Support  
>  Xoopit, Inc.  
>  2711 18th Street, Suite 21  
>  San Francisco, CA 94110 

Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. 

Xoopit may use certain information about you and/or your Material without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Site is used, diagnosing Site or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. 

We use cookies, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in. 

## How We Share Your Information

Your email address and name may be used when a User attempts to invite you via email to join Xoopit. 

### Personally Identifiable Information:

Xoopit will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Xoopit may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Xoopit (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). 

We may transfer information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in our Privacy Policy or we would inform you before another privacy policy is applied. 

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Xoopit will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Xoopit, our users or others. 

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information:

We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Xoopit services. 

In the future, Xoopit may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Xoopit site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Xoopit. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. 

Xoopit does not currently, and will not in the future, provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Xoopit to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-24) or audience segment (for example, women ages 32-40 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Xoopit privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers. 

Xoopit may also provide links to third-party websites, advertisers, and others. The Xoopit privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party websites. You should consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit from links on the Xoopit site. 

## How We Protect Your Information

### Security of the Personal Information

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

### Compromise of Personal Information

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Xoopit will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

### Notification Procedures

It is the policy of Xoopit to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers or web site users, via E-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our web site page, [www.xoopit.com](http://www.xoopit.com/), as determined by Xoopit in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Xoopit reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers or web site users.

## Your Choices About Your Information

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Xoopit, in which case Xoopit may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information at any time by logging in to your account. You can review and correct the information about you that Xoopit keeps on file by contacting us directly at [support@xoopit.com](mailto:support@xoopit.com).

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Xoopit. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [privacy@xoopit.com](mailto:privacy@xoopit.com).
