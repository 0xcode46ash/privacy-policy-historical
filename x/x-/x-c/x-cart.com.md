# X-Cart: Privacy statement

"New web-site from scratch" means you want us to create a web-site of any kind and make it ready to go live. Since creation of a web-site from the very beginning is quite a complex process it may include multiple stages like:  
• web-design creation and integration;  
• integration of a pre-made design template into selected platform;  
• filling in the product catalog;  
• developing desired features;  
• installation onto the web-hosting;  
• etc.
