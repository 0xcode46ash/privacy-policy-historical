Changes to the Human Rights Act and Data Protection Acts also state that any person who does not wish their details to be processed by a data controller, such as i-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd will have the right to have their details removed as and when is reasonably possible.

Since 1997, i-CD has operated its own proprietary record removal service for Electoral Roll records only. Known as a CO1 form, it allows any voter to request that their details be removed within a reasonable time frame. This is now a requirement incorporated into both the Human Rights and Data Protection Acts and does not include private phone numbers or business details.   
  
     **What information does i-CD Publishing collect from me?**  
  
Anyone may register for searches through I-CD Publishing's web site, 192.com. I-CD Publishing believes that your experience with us will be improved if you personalise your service, and you can do this by providing us with your name, e-mail address and postcode. A good example of the merits of a personalised service is: Should your details be searched by another customer of 192.com, I-CD would be able to supply you with the details and IP address of the person making that search, thereby allowing you to "watch the watcher". Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES is your information made available to the public through our Directory Enquiry service. 

i-CD may also collect information on the way in which you use the 192.com service and access third party providers that operate through the 192.com web site to help ascertain your preferences and usage patterns. This information will be used to continue to improve the site. In addition, 192.com may routinely collect other types of information, such as the automatic numbering information provided by your telephone network (similar to caller ID-type information), the Internet protocol address provided by your web browser, or any other information made available simply through your use of 192.com. We may also record the oral or voice communications that you make when contacting I-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd, for training purposes.   
  
     **How does I-CD Publishing use my information?**  
  
Most web sites recall information about visitors by using cookies, which are small data structures that identify an individual and allow password protection. When you access 192.com from a computer, I-CD may store cookies on your computer's hard drive (NB: Cookies cannot harm or interfere with your machine in ANY way). Cookies may also be stored on 192.com's servers when you access the 192.com Service by modem.. From time to time, I-CD Publishing may use your email address to share with you information about the new and innovative I-CD Publishing products and services to 192.com, which are specially developed or based on information and feedback received from our customers. Your postcode may be used to create an easy to remember personal account number to ensure availability in your area. Furthermore, i-CD Publishing may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties.   
**IMPORTANT: When you perform a search on 192.com, 192.com will store a log that you made that search for security and privacy reasons. This information may be disclosed to the police.**  
  
     **Will anybody else have access to my information?**  
  
192.com distinguishes between "personally identifiable information" (which can be used to identify you specifically) and "non-personally identifiable information" (which cannot be used to identify you specifically). Respecting your privacy is important to I-CD Publishing, and so we take particular care in how we use and share your personally identifiable information. We may make personally identifiable information available to our employees and certain third parties with whom we contract. For example, we may provide this information to parties providing technical support services for I-CD Publishing (UK) Ltd or to third parties who provide optional services to our users. I-CD Publishing may provide unique identifiers, aggregate statistics, demographic, and other non-personally identifying information about our users to advertisers, Service Providers, and other third parties. Such information can help these parties better their services to you and other consumers. While I-CD Publishing is committed to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not described in this policy. Third parties may, for instance, unlawfully intercept or access transmissions and private communications without our consent. In addition, I-CD Publishing may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the legal process, (ii) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of I-CD Publishing, our users of 192.com or the public. I-CD Publishing cannot accept any responsibility for accidental or inadvertent disclosure, unauthorised access or for other disclosure as required by law or described herein.   
  
     **What information might other Service Providers collect from me?**  
  
It is important to understand that other companies and individuals ("Service Providers") may provide content or offer products or services in conjunction with or accessed through 192.com. It is possible to access these Service Providers while using 192.com's service. I-CD Publishing is not responsible for the actions, practices or content of Service Providers. We neither guarantee that Service Providers will adhere to suitable privacy standards nor accept responsibility for their policies, information practices or other actions. You alone are responsible for any information that you provide to third parties through the use of 192.com.   
  
     **What else can I do to protect my personal information?**  
  
The best way to protect your privacy is always to be careful when disclosing any personal information, both in deciding what you reveal and to whom you reveal it. For instance, 192.com may offer users the opportunity to access phone calls, conference calls, talk lines, chat rooms, forums, message boards, mailing lists, and other communication exchanges. Please remember that any information that is disclosed through such means may become public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information under these circumstances, particularly with respect to personal information. We also recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and any account information.   
  
     **What safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of children?**  
  
**I-CD Publishing is of course particularly concerned about the privacy and safety of children. I-CD Publishing has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. I-CD Publishing does not knowingly invite or permit individuals under the age of 13 to use 192.com. It must be noted however, that I-CD Publishing has no reasonable method of preventing individuals under the age of 13 from accessing 192.com.**  
  
     **May I review, correct or delete my personal information?**  
  
I-CD Publishing currently provides users the ability to disable, review or correct personal account information maintained by 192.com. To remove information from the directory complete a C01 form.

As we noted above, we may change our Privacy Policy occasionally. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you can always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Your continued use of 192.com following the posting of any changes to these terms on this web site will mean that you accept those changes.
