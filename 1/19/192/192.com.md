## Information that we collect during the registration process 

If you register with 192.com we will ask you to provide a small amount of personal information including, but not limited to, your name, address and email address.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL please [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).

Personal Information that you provide is stored on secure servers compliant with the strict procedures required by the Data Protection Act 1998. These cover the storage and disclosure of information you provide and the prevention of unauthorised access. Credit card transactions are all encrypted before transactions take place to protect your personal details. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

During the 192 credit payment process you may be asked for your Date of Birth and by providing your Date of Birth you are consenting to 192.com performing a check on its validity in order to enhance your security further by ensuring your credit card is not being used without your authority.
