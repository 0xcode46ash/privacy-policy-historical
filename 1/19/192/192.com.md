## About 192.com

192.com has been providing online directory enquiries since 1997. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users by keeping all personal information that we collect secure and by only using such data for the purpose(s) for which it was collected and for which we have our users’ consent. While our objective is to provide the most comprehensive UK directory of people and businesses we also respect the choice of people to be removed from particular published databases. We are registered with the Office of the Information Commissioner under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

## About the data we hold on you 

192.com publishes personal data taken from various public and private data sets:

Free Directory Enquires

Directors Database

### The Free Directory Enquiry Database

This is the national directory enquiry database maintained by BT. Your telephone provider licenses your data to BT who then sublicense it to all directory enquiry providers. If you wish to amend or remove your data from this database you need to contact your Telecom Provider who can then update your information with BT, and BT will then distribute the corrected information to all Directory Enquiry providers.

### Electoral Roll

192.com publishes Electoral Roll data from 2002 to the current Electoral Roll. This information is licensed from your local council and is supplied to 192.com as well as other businesses such as credit agencies. You can contact your local council where you can opt out of the Electoral Roll. The Electoral Roll is used by companies for a variety of different purposes from identity checking to direct marketing. We would recommend only coming off the Electoral Roll if you have a specific need to, if you are concerned about direct marketing or junk mail there are ways to prevent this rather than opting out of the Electoral Roll
