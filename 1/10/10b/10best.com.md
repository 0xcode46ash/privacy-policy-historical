**Privacy Summary**

> We at 10Best take your privacy seriously. We use the information we collect about you during the registration process to provide a more personalized experience. We also take your information into consideration as we develop new functionality for the site. Ultimately, the information we collect is for the sole purpose of providing you with the "best" experience possible. We do not rent, lease, or sell your personal information, and currently have no plans to do so.

**The Information We Collect**

> **My Account Section**
> 
>  **"Details"**  
>  This is the only data "required" for registration. It simply allows us to separate one user from another and to "personalize" your 10Best experience. **The only required information is User Name, Password, and Email Address.** This section also contains information about our mailing list, newsletters, email format (html or plain text), Start City (for linking directly to your favorite city), Wireless provider (if applicable), and automatic log in preferences.

> **"Profiles"**   
>  Profiles are simply your way of telling 10Best about the things you like. All fields are entirely optional. But the more we know about you, the better chance we have of recommending those businesses that best match your profiles. 
> 
> **"Mobile Tools"**   
>  Your My Mobile area allows you to setup and customize features for our wireless 10Best service. For web-enabled phones, visit mobile.10best.com using your phone's mini-browser. **GeoMarks** are simply addresses that you save as reference points. From these points, you can find the closest 10Best businesses as well as driving directions - without having to type in your favorite addresses over and over again. Save your home address, your office address, the address of a hotel you'll be staying at for a week - any address you will want to use as a reference point for directions.

**Cookies**

> 10Best utilizes cookies to identify a user. No personal information is stored in a cookie.

**Consent**

> As a registered user of 10Best, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to 10Best.

**Future Changes**

> 10Best reserves the right to change its Privacy Statement from time to time in its discretion which you acknowledge by registering as a user. To be aware of the most up to date version of the Privacy Statement, you should consult the Privacy Statement when using the site. Thanks for using 10Best.
