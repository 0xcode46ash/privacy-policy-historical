**Third Party Cookies**

Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, traffic measurement services, and other third parties may set cookies through the Platform and Site and access your device if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser or they may otherwise have access to information about your device that does not directly identify you. These third party cookies are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. If you do not want the services that third party cookies provide, you may be able to opt-out by visiting [http://youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.euo/), [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/), and/or [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**Do Not Track**

As discussed above, you may opt out of third party cookies at any time. However, we do not currently support any browser based Do Not Track (DNT) settings or participate in any DNT frameworks, and we do not assign any meaning to any potential DNT track signals you may send or alter any of our data collection or use practices in response to such signals.

**Other websites**

This policy applies only to 1010discover, our Services and the Site. There may be links on our Site to third party websites over which we have no control and when you click on advertisements or links you will leave our Site and go to another site and thereafter it is that third party’s site whose privacy policy will apply. A third party’s privacy practices may differ from ours.

We accept no responsibility or liability for any third party practices on third party websites and advise you to carefully read third party privacy statements prior to the use of any third party website.

**California privacy rights**

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. To make such a request, please contact us as described and the end of this policy.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information or if you wish to access, correct, or delete the personal information held by us, you should contact us in writing using the information provided below. As may be provided under applicable law, we will provide you with copies of your personal information; we will require a nominal administration charge of US$10 for all individuals located outside the European Economic Area.
