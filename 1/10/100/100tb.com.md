# Our Privacy Policy - 100TB.com

* #### Log Files

HSI gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

* #### Visitors to Our Website

HSI’s web servers collect information from visitors to the website linked to this Privacy Policy. Because each User’s computer and browser configurations are different, we may collect some, or all, of the following information during their visit:

  1. Internet protocol address; 
  2. The type of browser or computer used; 
  3. The number of links clicked within HSI’s website; 
  4. The state or country from which our website was accessed; 
  5. The date and time of visit; 
  6. The name of Internet service provider used to access our website; 
  7. The web page visited prior to coming to our website; and 
  8. The pages viewed on HSI’s website. 



We use this information to improve our website, services and user experience, as well as communicate with contest participants. 

* #### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a Users’ computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information that Users submit while on our site.

We use session ID cookies to make it easier for Users to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when Users close their browser. 

If Users reject cookies, they may still use our site, but their ability to use some areas of our site, such as our shopping cart, will be limited.

* #### Clear Gifs 

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons/web bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our User’s personally identifiable information. 

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If Users would like to opt out of these emails, please click the "unsubscribe" link in the email footer. 

We use clear gifs, which do not identify individual Users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track Users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our customer base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. 

We use the following third-party tracking services: Google Analytics, DirectTrack, which use cookies and web beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate of IP addresses to track marketing efforts and affiliate sales. We have no access or control of these third-party tracking technologies. Each of these services works differently; however, they all collect information related to the website from which Users came to HSI, Users’ operating system, browser type, where Users go on HSI’s website, length of time on our website, and where Users go after visiting our website. In addition, these services may keep Users logged into HSI’s system. From time-to-time, HSI may use services that will be used to serve advertising and other information to Users after they visit our website. Because the technologies underlying these services differ, Users may, or may not, be able to choose not to provide information to them.

* #### Email Correspondence 

HSI will use Users’ names and email addresses to send newsletters to them. These newsletters include information on promotions, services, and company information. Out of respect for User privacy, we provide Users a way to unsubscribe in each promotional email. 

We will send Users service-related announcements on occasion when it is necessary to do so; for example, if there is network maintenance, Users will receive an email. Users may opt out of these communications by clicking the unsubscribe link provided.

If Users do not want to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, they may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at: sales@100TB.com.

* #### Third-Party Sharing

We will share Users’ personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. These third parties include credit card processors, technology vendors chosen by Users to be included in the services, and bandwidth providers. We do not sell User personal information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose User personal information: as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect User safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request and; to any other third party with the User’s prior consent to do so. 

HSI may aggregate information covered by this Privacy Policy and disclose it outside our business. This information will not identify Users individually.

* #### Linked/Advertiser Sites

From time-to-time, we may include links or banners for third-party sites, including sites that advertise. This privacy policy does not govern the information these sites collect when you visit them. These sites will know that you have visited them from our site.

* #### Security

The security of Users’ personal information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. When Users enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Electronic communication (for example: email, online chat, or instant messaging) that Users may send HSI may not be secure unless HSI advises Users in advance that security measures will be in place prior to transmitting the information. Users should not send confidential information such as financial information, social security numbers or passwords to HSI through unsecured electronic communication. 

* #### Data Retention

We will retain User’s information for as long as their account is active or as needed to provide Users services. If Users wish to cancel their account or request that we no longer use their information to provide them services, contact us at billing@100TB.com. We will retain and use User information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Following termination of the Users’ agreement with us, Users will have no access to this information, and we may delete it for any reason, at any time.

* #### Business Transitions

In the event HSI goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Users’ personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. Users will be notified via e-mail of any such change in ownership or control of their personal information.

* #### Contact Us

If Users have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at: 1-888-395-0752 or sales@100TB.com. However, if a particular section of this Privacy Policy has a specific contact point, Users must use that point.
