If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at policy{at}100daysofrealfood{dot}com. You are also encouraged to read our [Terms of Use](https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/terms-of-use/).

### Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal identifying information from you merely for using our Web Site, or for sharing or using the content on the Web Site, or for posting comments on the Web Site, except as provided specifically below.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit our website. These companies will NOT have access to or use any personally identifiable information (including your name, address, email address or telephone number) but will use other non-personal information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this website, other sites, and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp>.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Web Site.

If you sign up for email updates, we collect your email address and a user name.  You will receive an email when a new blog post is published.  We may occasionally email you with announcements or products you may be interested in. You may unsubscribe from email updates by following the instructions at the bottom of one of the emails.

The Web Site is intended for use by persons 18 years and older. 100 Days of Real Food does not knowingly collect any information about children under the age of thirteen.

### Use And Disclosure Of Information

We will never share your email address or other private information with anyone without your permission.

If it is necessary to provide a service to you, we may request that you provide us with contact information sufficient to provide the service.  An example would be if you won a giveaway and the manufacturer needed to contact you to set up direct delivery (in which case permission is implied through participation in the contest).

100 Days of Real Food only shares personal information with third parties when we have a good faith belief that sharing the information is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use including investigation of potential violations thereof; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 100 Days of Real Food, our Users, or others.  We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personal information from Users for any commercial purpose.  Security

100 Days of Real Food’s service provider (“Service Provider”) uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control.  We store information in databases located in secured data centers with live personnel monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Data security is paramount, and our Service Provider is constantly re-evaluating and deploying, where appropriate, the latest technologies to enhance our security and the confidentiality of personal information. Detailed information is available here <https://www.liquidweb.com/static/pdf/2014_SOC3_Final.pdf>.

We personally take additional security measures to block unauthorized access to our web platform including secure socket layer encryption, strong passwords, 2-step verification, and code to block brute force password cracking.

### **How We Use Cookies**

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

### **Advertising**

Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the website, one of which is [http://www.gourmetads.com](http://www.gourmetads.com/). These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
