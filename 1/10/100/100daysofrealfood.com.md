We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit our website. These companies will NOT have access to or use any personally identifiable information (including your name, address, email address or telephone number) but will use other non-personal information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this website, other sites, and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Web Site.

You may unsubscribe from email updates by following the instructions at the bottom of one of the emails.

The Web Site is intended for use by persons 18 years and older. 100 Days of Real Food does not knowingly collect any information about children under the age of thirteen.

### Use And Disclosure Of Information

We will never share your email address or other private information with anyone without your permission.

If it is necessary to provide a service to you, we may request that you provide us with contact information sufficient to provide the service.  An example would be if you won a giveaway and the manufacturer needed to contact you to set up direct delivery (in which case permission is implied through participation in the contest).

100 Days of Real Food only shares personal information with third parties when we have a good faith belief that sharing the information is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use including investigation of potential violations thereof; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 100 Days of Real Food, our Users, or others.  We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personal information from Users for any commercial purpose.  Security

100 Days of Real Food’s service provider (“Service Provider”) uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control.  We store information in databases located in secured data centers with live personnel monitoring 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Data security is paramount, and our Service Provider is constantly re-evaluating and deploying, where appropriate, the latest technologies to enhance our security and the confidentiality of personal information. Detailed information is available here <https://www.liquidweb.com/datacenter/2012soc3-final.pdf>.

We personally take additional security measures to block unauthorized access to our web platform including secure socket layer encryption, strong passwords, 2-step verification, and code to block brute force password cracking.

### User Changes
