## COLLECTION & USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We collect personal information from you when you register to become a member of the website or when you make a purchase through our online store. Personal information such as contact information is required in order to register and receive the subscribed services. In completing the online form, you accept that you have granted us consent to collect and use your contact information. If you do not provide us with the necessary contact information (e.g. phone number, address, contact details such as email address, payment and account details, occupation, hobbies and interests), you will not be able to subscribe and receive the paid information service.

In addition, we may ask you for health information, such as height, weight, age, fitness and nutrition details, some of which may be classified as sensitive personal information. This may also include photographic images of you. You do not have to provide us with your health information, however this means that you may not be eligible to enter some competitions, nor able to receive tailored information specific to your needs.

Contact information will not be disclosed publicly or with other third parties by us unless authorised by law (and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site) or as otherwise outlined in this policy. Your health information, however, may be disclosed publicly on the website, along with your image. This is for the purposes of publicly profiling your fitness, displaying the results of competitions, promoting the service and encouraging other members. When we collect this information we will ask you if you consent to public disclosure on the website. If at any time you no longer consent then you must contact us where directed below.

We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.

It is your responsibility to advise us of any changes to your personal details to ensure we can keep our records accurate and up to date. We will only collect information directly from you. If you are disclosing details of another person (for example, a minor on whose behalf you are registering), it is your sole responsibility to ensure that that person consents to the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information in the manner set out in this policy.

Your contact information may be used, in addition to the primary purposes outlined above, for account and billing purposes, marketing purposes (see below), by third party service providers such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf (to the extent required for the limited purpose of providing services contracted to us so that we may service you) or to respond to an enquiry if you choose to contact us. In certain circumstances, such as in response to a claim of copyright infringement, we will use your email address to action a request for a Take Down Notice, or to otherwise administer our terms of registration (for example, notifying you of breach).

We will preserve the content of any email or information you submit if we believe we have a legal requirement to do so, or if any form of email abuse is suspected.

In the event 12WBT goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

## MARKETING MATERIAL

When you sign up for our services, we will provide you with material from time to time about new services and products available to you from us or invite you to continue to use our services. This information will only come from us. We will not pass on or on-sell your personal information to other providers without your consent. If at any time you no longer consent then you can click the 'unsubscribe' link on the mail-out or contact us at admin@12wbt.com

## TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

We, and our third party tracking utilities-partners, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

As is true of most web sites and mobile applications, we and, in some instances, our third party tracking-utility partners gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

## Advertising

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## Social Media Features

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

## Forums

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at admin@12wbt.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

## PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will take all reasonable steps to protect the information we hold about you from unauthorised access, use and disclosure, however we cannot guarantee that our systems will be completely free from third party interception or are incorruptible from viruses. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. In light of this, we cannot ensure or warrant, and do not warrant, the security or privacy of your personal information, including payment and account details. You transmit this information at your own risk. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at admin@12wbt.com.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your passwords and/or any account information.

We will destroy your information when it is no longer needed or required to be kept by law.

If you use our website to link to another site we encourage you to view their terms and conditions of use, privacy policies and security statements before disclosing any of your personal information on those sites.

## Testimonials

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at admin@12wbt.com.

## ACCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you wish to access the information we hold about you, please submit a request to [admin@12wbt.com](mailto:admin@12wbt.com) or by logging into your account and making the appropriate changes. You are entitled to edit, update or delete such information unless we are required by law to retain it. Note that if we delete your contact information, we may not be able to provide you with the subscribed service.

If you request us not to use personal information in a particular manner or at all, we will adopt reasonable measures to observe your request but we may still use or disclose your information if you subsequently consent to the disclosure or we believe the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or as otherwise required by law.

If you know the information we hold about you is not accurate or complete, please advise us so we can amend it. We will respond to requests for access within 30 days.

## NOTIFICATION OF PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a prominent notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

## PRIVACY CONCERNS

If you have any concerns about how we handle your personal information or require further information, please contact the Privacy Officer at [admin@12wbt.com](mailto:admin@12wbt.com).
