# Privacy Policy

At 123 Print, we respect our customers and understand that you are concerned about privacy, so we have instituted policies intended to protect your personal information. The purpose of this privacy policy is to let you know what kind of information we collect, with whom it may be shared, what choices you have regarding the use of your information, and how you may review and change some of the data you provide to us. 

As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we offer, this policy likely will change. We will not be notifying you directly but will post the changes here in the Privacy Policy. We, therefore, encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you fully understand our current privacy policy.

_What Information Do We Collect?_

We collect various types of information when you interact with us on our website. For example, we use "cookies" to obtain certain information from your web browser. By transferring these alphanumeric identifiers or "cookies" that your browser creates at our request in an approved and standardized place on your computer, 123 Print assigns you a unique customer code and records information about your activity on our website. When you visit or return to our website, we read the cookie to identify you as one of our customers (or prior visitor) to help you recall orders or preferences you have selected. The cookie also enables us to recall your past activities, post your account data, and modify site elements and special offers to you. 

We also store certain types of information when you interact with us on our website. Most web browsers accept cookies by default, but allow users to reject them by changing the browser preferences. If you have set up your browser to reject cookies, some aspects of our site, including our Shopping Cart, will not work properly. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by 123 Print only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

The following categories of information collected include but are not limited to:  
(1) Your first and last name.  
(2) A business or other physical addresses, including street name and name of a city or town.  
(3) Your email address.  
(4) Your telephone number.  
(5) Your order history which will include all relevant data.  
(6) Your IP address and browser information.  
(7) Any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. 

_Do We Share Your Information?_

The information gathered may be shared with corporate affiliates of 123 Print. We also share the information with third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a relationship. For example:

Some of our vendors may work closely with us to create a vendor shop within the 123 Print site or to ship your order directly to you. In certain instances, we may share certain information about you with that vendor (e.g., if you decide to buy their products).

You also may make a purchase from 123 Print through a link from another web site or search engine and may use their express checkout tool to do so. When you do, please be aware that both 123 Print and that website or search engine will receive your information.

In some cases, 123 Print may enter into a co-branding relationship with another website that offers you products or services that supplement 123 Print's offering (e.g., flowers). In those cases, you may link from 123 Print to another site to purchase the item. In that case, both 123 Print and the other website may receive your information.

We may retain reliable third party companies to provide order fulfillment and customer service on our behalf and they will have access to your information.

For some of our products, 123 Print may provide you with a link to the supplier of that product so that you may get further information. If you link to the supplier's site, the supplier may collect or receive information about you.

Like other companies, 123 Print may use an outside company to place its advertising banners or links on other sites or to permit other companies to place its advertising on 123 Print. In certain cases, the advertiser may collect information on people who click on the banner or link. 123 Print will, on occasion, rent or exchange its customer's names, addresses, and transaction nominations with other marketers. Customers will be provided with a choice not to have their contact information rented or exchanged via an opt-out mechanism by which to exercise their choice. 123 Print will promptly honor such opt-out requests at no cost to its customers. 

123 Print also may share your personal information with outside companies that perform services for 123 Print. For example, we may retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information or to create and distribute an email offering. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for 123 Print, and 123Print takes appropriate steps to ensure your information is used only to provide the services requested by 123 Print, and not for other purposes. 

Additionally, 123 Print may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection. 

And in the event that some or all of the business assets of 123 Print are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information about our customers. 

Finally, 123 Print may share your personal information with unrelated outside companies so that they can directly market their products or services to you if we feel that a company offers products or services that we believe may be of interest. We also may provide you with the opportunity to sign-up on our website to receive such email offers.
