The Subjex CSR: Customer Service Representative

  * This is an automated program provided by the Subjex Corporation for a fee paid by the Black Hawk Tobacco, Inc. as a service for our customers.
  * As far as we know, the Subjex Corporation does not archive information sent to the Black Hawk Tobacco, Inc. through this program.
  * All private information is deleted from the CSR archives.
  * All questions are added to the CSR's memory in order to improve its future response. For example, if you write, "My name is Jane Doe in New York. What is the price of Seneca cigarettes?" We would delete the first part of your comments from the program. The second part will however be added to the program's memory.
  * We do not use any information provided by you for any other purpose.
