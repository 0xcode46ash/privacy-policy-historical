#### The information we collect

When you sign up as a tenant we collect your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. We also collect sensitive information such as your passport number. We collect demographic information such as date of birth and gender. We collect information from you about joint applicants. We collect information directly from any joint applicant who signs up with us, and we link that information to your account.

If you provide us with information about another person, we rely on you to inform those individuals that you are providing their personal information to us and to advise them that we can be contacted for further information.

After you have created your profile you may provide us with additional information such as your Driver’s License number, photo (which will appear on your application), previous address of residency, and employment information as well as a personal reference and a business reference.

All the information you provide to us (other than your credit card number) is passed onto the real estate agent, property managers or landlord and forms part of your rental application for the purposes of assessing your application for tenancy to live in the property for which you are applying.

If you are a Property Manager you will need to download the PDF form and fill it out and fax it back to us at the fax number indicated on the form. We use the information to create your account so that you may manage your tenancy applications online.

If you choose not to provide certain personal information (e.g. your date of birth), we may not be able to provide you with the services you require.

We may share your personal information with third parties who provide products and services regarding property and real estate. In doing so, we ensure that such third parties have a privacy policy that applies to your information. If you would like a list of who we provide your personal information to, please contact our privacy officer. If you do not wish to have your personal information provided to third parties, please contact our privacy officer.
