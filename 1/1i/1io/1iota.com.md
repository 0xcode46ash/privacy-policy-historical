# 1iotaproductions.com :: Privacy Policy

** Introduction**  
The Privacy Policy below will govern your 1iota membership and any information you provide on this site.  In order to become a member of 1 iota and to reduce the risk of fraud, 1iota productions must ask you to provide us with information about yourself. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. 1iota takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  We will not sell or rent your  personally identifiable information or a list of our members to third parties.  However, as described in more detail below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy.

** Changes of Policy**   
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to 1iota or as we incorporate new suggestions from our members.  If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you by e-mail with at least 30 days’ notice of the amended Privacy Policy.

** Required Information**  
The information required is everything on the registration page that is marked with a red asterisk.  In order to become a basic member of 1iota, you must provide credit card, or debit card account information (see membership types).  In this instance we will ask you to answer two security questions (such as your favorite band or your pet’s name), so we can identify you, should you need to make any changes in your information.

** Customer Feedback**  
If you send us feedback, including e-mails and faxes, we will retain such information in the records of your membership. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.  We encourage customers to send us feedback, as it is an important aspect of our constantly evolving business (link see feedback page).

** Use and Disclosure  
** We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide membership services, 2) to determine your eligibility to be selected for special events and shows, and 3) to improve our membership relations and services.  ** **

** Disclosure to other 1iota members  
** You will remain anonymous to other 1iota members unless you decide otherwise.  Our chat room and dating service will require you to enter your 1 iota membership number, which will then give you the opportunity to choose an anonymous screen name to chat with other members.  What you choose to disclose inside the chat room, 1iota will not be held responsible for. 

** Disclosure to Third Parties**  
1iota will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. 1iota will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission. These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.

  1. If selected for a show, 1iota will be authorized to use the information provided, to grant you access to the event and take the proper security precautions required by event staff or security (such as background checks). At your request, we share only e-mail addresses with affiliated nightclubs and promoters, upon signing up for the nightlife guest-list option.

  2. We disclose the information we collect, as described in “Required information” section above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements (for example, we disclose information to ABC National Bank, which is the issuer of 1iota American Express credit cards, so that ABC National Bank can determine customers’ eligibility for the 1iota credit card, and so that 1iota and ABC National Bank can better match the services we offer to our members needs). These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified 1iota related services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other uses.

  3. We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.

  4. We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in New York. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.

  5. As with any other business, it is possible that 1iota in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by 1 iota, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above in the “Changes of Policy” section.




** Security**  
1iota is committed to handling your membership information with a high standard of security. Your credit card account information is stored only in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employers who need to know that information in order to provide security, access, or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes.

The security of your 1iota membership also relies on your protection of your 1 iota password/Id number. We strongly urge that you never share your 1iota password/Id number with anyone. You will only be asked for your 1iota password/ID number if you are trying to register for an event or sign up for the chat-room, dating service, or nightlife guest-list option.  If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately or request it to be changed by  [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/web/20031211013947id_/http%3A//www.1iota.com/1iotaproductions/contact.asp).
