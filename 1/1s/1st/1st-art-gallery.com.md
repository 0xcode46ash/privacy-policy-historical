**Order Information**  
We only gather information that visitors to 1st-art-gallery.com are willing to give. Some of it is required to fulfill orders (like names, shipping addresses, and phone numbers) or to maintain accounts (such as customer accounts and affiliate accounts) and we ask for some information so that we can provide better service (contact information like email addresses and phone numbers, for example).

**Email**  
We keep all the email we receive and send so that we can find all the information we need about particular order histories.

We send email to customers only if it concerns a specific order or question, or if the customer has opted to receive promotional emails.

**Privacy**  
1St-Art-Gallery maintains a strict privacy protocol for all customer information. Occasionally, we email our customers to let them know about new products, services, offers, promotions, and anything else we think might be of interest (unless you don't want us to, in which case just let us know and we won't).

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**  
We do not share our customers' personal information with anyone. Period.

**Non-Identifying Information**  
We collect all kinds of statistics about visits to our site � where the visitors came from, what they did and viewed during their visit, what kinds of computers and browsers they use, and where they went when they left. However, we do not (and cannot) collect any personally identifying information (names, email addresses and such) this way.
