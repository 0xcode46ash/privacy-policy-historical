Last Monday I searched local shops and the net to find a retailer who could supply a certain make of washing machine. However, no one could deliver within a week and all quoted delivery charges. Then I saw the machine on your web site and ordered it. We received a phone call from you that same day and the goods arrived the next day. You also took my old machine away without quibble or charge. Excellent service!!! I shall certainly recommend you to my friends.
