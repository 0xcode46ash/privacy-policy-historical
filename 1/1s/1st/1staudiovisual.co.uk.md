I ordered a Samsung Smart TV for delivery to my daughter. The order was dealt with promptly and efficiently. It was, as usual, excellent value. This is the third TV I have purchased from 1staudiovisual and I would highly recommend them.

**_James Whatley  ,Says :_**

To confirm that the set is up and running ok. Many thanks to you all Phii ,June, and John for the excellent service you have given us we look forward to buying from you in the future. All i can say now is have a Merry Christmas and all the best for the New year.

I wanted to thank you for your excellent service this week. I visited your website and found the Samsung TV that I wanted. I telephoned on Wednesday afternoon (23/11/11) to see if the model was in stock and if I could have it delivered on Friday (25/11/11). I was put through to a very helpful lady who took my telephone number and said she would check with the warehouse and then call me back. She did indeed call back and said that if I ordered the TV on-line that Wednesday afternoon, then I could have it delivered on Friday. I asked her how much would be charged for additional carriage for such a quick delivery. Much to my amazement, she said that carriage would still be free ! I placed the order and emailed to check that I could still have the Friday delivery. I received an email confirmation within about an hour to say Yes. The TV was delivered on Friday morning. The delivery driver was one of the most courteous and helpful guys that we have come across. Well Done ! I have no hesitation in recommending your company.

I always get nervous when odering on line and the samsung smart tv was my biggest and most delecate purchase thus far...and with a new dealer to me i was slightly wary........ but the service, customer and delivery was and has been faultless. my tv was odered monday evening and arrived by standard postage on wednesday,.rnevery time i called the centre with a querie before the purchase the staff were curtious and polite and updated my account regularly.. i have yet to open my tv as im too little to lift it and hope in the future i wont have to try the returns service a few months down the line .rnthus far though all has bee very good. thank you x

Hi. Just to confirm that the monitor was delivered at 09:50 this morning, which is an amazing performance by you and City Link. As far as I can tell, the monitor and packaging are physically intact and undamaged in transit. I have not yet installed the monitor. I intend to do so tomorrow and will update you on its operation. I must congratulate you again on your brilliant service in respect of this order. Initially I admit I was disappointed that the original item was not in stock when you processed the order, as it was when I placed it, but that is hardy your fault. Since then, you have kept me informed all the way - promptly and courteously. The final touch - of offering an alternative and arranging for its express delivery - was very much appreciated. Thank you for all your efforts - I shall certainly recommend you to my colleagues and friends.

**_Mel Brunt  ,Says :_**

Excellent service. Frequent tracking update emails received. Item is fantastic too! Would definately recommend!
