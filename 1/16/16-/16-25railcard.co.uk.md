# Privacy Policy - 16-25 Railcard

When you purchase a Railcard from Train Companies or Licensed Third Party Retailers (“us”), you will provide us with personal data. We recognize the need to treat your data in an appropriate and lawful manner, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The purpose of this notice is to make you aware of how we will handle your personal data.

## Why do we need your personal data?

When you buy a Railcard, from a Railcard.co.uk website, transactions are managed by Journeycall Limited, and as such, Journeycall Limited is responsible for the processing and distribution of Railcard products. During your purchase, we will ask you to provide us with personal information, such as name, address, email address and date of birth, and we will use this to process your purchase and send you the Railcard. We may also ask for further sensitive information, such as driving licence or passport number, disabilities and medical information, for the purposes of proof of eligibility for some Railcard types.

## What data do we hold and for how long will we keep it?

We will keep your data securely while the Railcard is valid. This will allow us to: remind you when your Railcard is due to expire to enable you to renew easily; send you information about any changes to your Railcard’s terms and conditions; and, if you have so chosen, to receive marketing communications from us, including offers and information on similar products and services you may be interested in.

When your Railcard has expired, we will keep your data for a further 180 days, during which time you may still receive communications. After this point and for a further 4 years, we will keep your data in a dormant state, just in case you decide to renew or buy a new Railcard, so that we can match your Railcard history.

If you wish to know what personal data we hold about you, you must make the request in writing, with an accompanying fee of £10, payable to ATOC Ltd. All such written requests should be sent to the Data Protection Officer at Rail Delivery Group, 200 Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4HD.

## How accurate is the personal data that we keep?

The information we hold is supplied by you. If your details change, please update them by logging in to www.railcard.co.uk and follow the link to your account. If you do not have an online account, please call 0345 3000 250 or write to us at National Railcards, PO Box 6616, Arbroath DD11 9AR, stating your Name, Address and Railcard number, and we will amend your details.
