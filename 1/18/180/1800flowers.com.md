#### Your Privacy

At 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, we recognize and respect the importance of maintaining the privacy of our customers and members and have established this Privacy Policy as a result. Below we describe why we gather customer, member and third party information, what information we collect, how we collect it, what we use the information for and how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information. This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Use, which governs your use of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM. 

_Note: You must be 18 years or older to register as a member of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM._

**Why do we gather information?**

Since our inception, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM has consistently provided our customers with quality goods and excellent customer service. We gather personal information to allow us to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you and your gift and message recipients of special offers and discounts. 

**What information do we gather?**

Through our Web Site and emails,including when you place an order, we may collect the following information: your name, telephone number, email address, billing information (credit card number, expiration date and billing address), occasion type (birthday, Mothers day, etc.), products purchased, any relevant promotion code and information (for example if you are claiming frequent flyer miles) and the gift and message recipient's name, address, telephone number and email address. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. Also, if you register as a member, we request your name, address, phone number, email address, title (gender), birthdate, and other information set forth on the Member Registration Page. Members may also add to their Address Book the name, address and telephone number of friends or other persons to whom they may wish to send gifts or receive gift reminders. Only Members have the right to view and edit their Address Book entries. 

**How we use "cookies"**

A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site which gives you a numeric user ID and stores certain information about your activity on the site. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to provide certain features to you, for example to store information on your product selections as you shop on our site, but we do not store any personal information (except your name) or financial information about you using cookies. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but most allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, such as the shopping basket, will not function properly. 

**How we use the information we collect about you.**

We use information we collect from you to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you and your gift and message recipients of offers and discounts from 1-800-FLOWERS.COM or other sites and companies that we own. In addition, we periodically make such information, including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including but not limited to, those who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes. However, without your consent, we do not make your, or your gift or message recipient's email addresses available to third parties (except for subsidiaries, subcontractors or agents acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy)or any Successor (see below) to our business. If you would like us to email you a notice when our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use change, please follow the instructions below. Any email sent to your gift or message recipients will include a link to our Privacy Policy and a link to use if they wish not to receive further emails. You may instruct us not to share personal information you provide with third parties by following the instructions provided below. A Successor to our business is not to be considered to be a third party for these purposes (see below). 

In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (a "Successor"), one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our customers and members. However, the use of this information by any Successor would still be governed by the terms of this privacy policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction, and you will continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties. 

We may disclose any information you provide to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (i) when we believe disclosure to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental request, or to comply with judicial process; or (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate this web site or to process any purchases you make or conduct any promotions you participate in; (iii) to protect the rights or property of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, its users, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants. 

**Links**

1-800-FLOWERS.COM wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies, not ours. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other Web site. 

#### Your Security

Our Web site encrypts your credit card number prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the site is viewed using Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. 

However, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us.
