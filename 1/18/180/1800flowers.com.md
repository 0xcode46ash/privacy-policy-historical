#### Your Privacy

At 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, we recognize and respect the importance of maintaining the privacy of our customers and members and have established this Privacy Policy as a result. Below we describe why we gather customer and member information, what information we collect, how we collect it, what we use the information for and how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information. 

_Note: You must be 18 years or older to register as a member of  
1-800-FLOWERS.COM._

**Why do we gather information?**

Since our inception, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM has consistently provided our customers with quality goods and excellent customer service. We gather personal information to allow us to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you of special offers and discounts. 

**What information do we gather?**

When you order from our Web site, we collect the following information: your name, telephone number, email address, billing information (credit card number, expiration date and billing address), occasion type (birthday, Mothers day, etc.), products purchased, any relevant promotion code and information (for example if you are claiming frequent flyer miles) and the recipient's name, address and telephone number. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. Also, if you register as a member, we request your name, address, phone number, email address, title (gender), and other information set forth on the [Member Registration Page.](https://web.archive.org/web/20000621143628id_/http%3A//www.1800flowers.com/flowers/myshop/register.asp)

**How we use "cookies"**

A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site which gives you a numeric user ID and stores certain information about your activity on the site. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to provide certain features to you, for example to store information on your product selections as you shop on our site, but we do not store any personal information (except your name) or financial information about you using cookies. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but most allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, such as the shopping basket, will not function properly. 

**How we use the information we collect about you.**

We use information we collect from you to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you of offers and discounts from 1-800-FLOWERS.COM or other sites and companies that we own. In addition, we periodically make such information, including aggregated information, available to selected third parties who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes. However, we do not make your email addresses available to third parties (except for subsidiaries, subcontractors or agencies acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy), although we may do so in the future. If we do, we will first amend this policy. If you would like us to email you a notice when our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use change, please follow the instructions below. You may instruct us not to share information with third parties by following the instructions provided below. 

**Links**

1-800-FLOWERS.COM wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies, not ours. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other Web site. 

#### Your Security

Our Web site encrypts your credit card number prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the site is viewed using Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. 

However, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us.
