| | Security and Privacy Statement for 1800Mobiles.com1-800 MOBILES Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.1800mobiles.com. 

Our site's shopping cart requires users to give us contact information (like your name and email address) and financial information (like your credit card number). We use customer contact information from the shopping cart to process your orders and collect the due payment. 

**PRIVACY POLICY FOR CELLULAR PHONE ACTIVATIONS WITH SERVICE:** When customers buy a phone, they are also making a commitment with a specific carrier for a minimum of 12 months. Carriers require credit history checks when activating new service. These credit checks are not required when 1800mobiles customers are purchasing accessories, electronics or any other product that does not involve a contract with a wireless carrier. 

1800Mobiles.com only uses personal information such as social security number or date of birth, to run a credit history check for wireless service activation. We perform a standard industry credit check by inputting your data into the wireless carrier system. Once the carrier runs the check, it informs us of your approval status so that we can either process the order where the credit is approved or notify if you have not matched the carrier's credit requirements. **Aside from approval status information, we do not have access to any applicantâ€™s credit-history information and we do not use it or re-sell it in any other way.**

1800Mobiles has an opt-in newsletter. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services only.
