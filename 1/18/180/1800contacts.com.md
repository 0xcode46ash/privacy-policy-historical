1-800 CONTACTS, INC. may maintain links to other sites that are not under our control. These Web sites have their own policies regarding privacy, which you should review before visiting them.

Internet Security:  
How does 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. make sure my order information is secure?

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information.

More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use SSL security to protect their sensitive information. SSL security makes eavesdropping on the Internet nearly impossible. When you use our secure ordering page you can be assured that your sensitive information and monetary transactions with  
1-800 CONTACTS, INC. are encrypted, safe, and secure.

To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When assessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http://" to "https://."

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't allow or permit communication through secure servers. In that case, we have established a "Standard Server" option that you may select. This option is available on the Home page and is located just below the "Existing Customer" button. This connection does not use SSL technology and is not secure. If you can't access either of these servers or for any reason and would like to place your order by calling one of our Customer Service Representatives please dial 1-800-CONTACTS (1-800-266-8228).

Adware:

1-800 CONTACTS, INC. does not participate with or use third party services such as Gator.com, whenu.com or ezula.com. 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. has determined that there are instances where this type of advertising could be construed as confusing for customers. Therefore, 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. is in the process of taking steps to ensure that these third party adware services do not function on the 1-800 CONTACTS, INC. website. www.1800contacts.com
