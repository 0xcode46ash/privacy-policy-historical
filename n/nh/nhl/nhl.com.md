**Information requested from children (users under 13 years old)**

_At NHL.com and NHL4kids.com, we take our responsibilities to our younger visitors seriously.

  * We will not obtain personal information from children under 13 (such as full name, home address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) without first obtaining verifiable consent from their parents. Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's personal information, and will include an opportunity for parents to prevent use of their children's information as well as to prevent their children from participating in the online activity. Without prior parental consent, we will only use a child's personal information (for example, his or her e-mail address) to respond directly to a request from that child or to seek parental consent or provide parental notice. 
  * We will not use, distribute, or disclose any child's personal information to third parties without prior parental consent. 
  * If, at any time, a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use or maintenance of personal information collected from his or her child, we will promptly remove such information from our database. 
  * We will not require children under 13 to disclose more personal information than is necessary in order to participate in any game, contest, or similar online interactive activity hosted by us.
