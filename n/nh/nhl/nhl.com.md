  * We may request personal information from visitors such as name, home address, e-mail address, age, income, interests and gender for purposes such as newsletters, chat rooms, contest and auction registrations, and for participation in other interactive online activities. Additionally, some of our third party service providers (such as the companies that run the email and online store features of the website) may collect data from you and share some of the data with us. On these parts of the website, you will see additional information about the privacy practices of the companies who actually collect the data, including information on how to opt out of having these companies use your data for purposes unrelated to providing you the services that you are requesting from this website. 


  * We share data with the member teams of the National Hockey League and with affiliates of NHL ICE. While most of our fans appreciate having their data shared with their favorite NHL teams, we respect the right of each fan to control how his or her contact data is used.

However, unless these partners agree to limit use of your data for established purposes and in a manner consistent with our privacy practices, these partners do not have access to your data themselves. Finally, we do provide personal data to agents who perform services for us (such as fulfillment companies), but these agents are not permitted to use the data for any other purposes.
