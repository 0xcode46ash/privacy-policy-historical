We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.

This National Hot Rod Association ("NHRA") policy describes the kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and protected, and how you can control its use.  **This policy (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses the privacy practices of NHRA with respect to information collected through our web sites and any mobile applications published by NHRA (“Mobile App”), and does not describe or apply to our privacy practices conducted offline, except where specifically mentioned herein.

If you do not agree to our policies and practices, do not access our web sites or download, install or use our Mobile Apps.**

Some of our web sites contain links to other sites on which information practices may be different from ours. You should consult the other sites' privacy notices because we have no control over these third party sites including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used.  In addition, the NHRA web sites may offer services or content (e.g., racer registration and other racer matters, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys or other items) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. Through these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in that activity. NHRA has no control over these third parties' privacy practices, including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used, so we encourage you to read their privacy policy before providing information to them.

From time to time, we may request information from you regarding your membership or race activities, or generally via surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other means.

Information will be used to fulfill the specific purpose for which the information was given such as to enter you for a race, notify winners, and award prizes in a sweepstakes, and will also be used to contact users with further information about NHRA events, tickets, products and services, as well as the products and services of NHRA partners and third parties. Survey information and other information collected will also be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving NHRA web sites and to otherwise enhance NHRA’s business.

We may also collect information that is related to you from third parties, including, but not limited to, third-party verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources.

**What Do We Do With the Personal Information We Collect?**

We gather, store and archive the information we collect from our web sites, and we may use the personal information we collect from you for various purposes including: providing products and services including racer registration, other racer services, membership and subscription services, selling and promoting NHRA events and tickets, operating, maintaining and improving our web sites and Mobile Apps; marketing and research analysis; product service and development; promotion and advertising; fulfillment of a requested transaction (i.e., racer registration, sale of a product, delivery of a publication); processing contest entries and delivering rewards or prizes; record-keeping; marketing information, products and services we feel may be of interest to you; responding to comments and questions from users and building and customizing our web sites to individual visitors.

The types of businesses in which such third parties are engaged include but are not limited to the following: NHRA sponsors of various types; magazine publishing and retailing; market analysis and development; participatory databases; non-profit organizations; and advertisers.

Of course, online purchases require us to disclose necessary payment information to payment processors. We also may use third parties to send you products that you purchase, in which case we would provide them with your name, address, and other information to complete your order.

Non-personally identifiable visitor information in aggregated form may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses without restriction.

Agreements with third parties will provide that such third parties will not use or disclose the information for purposes other than those purposes contracted for, and will also require the third parties to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information in accordance with their own privacy policies.

You may choose not to provide NHRA with any contact information. However, if you opt out in this way, we will be unable to respond to your request for NHRA information, process your order, sign you up for NHRA membership or race registration, or allow you to participate in other NHRA web site services that require personal information. Additionally, your ability to navigate our site may be limited. You may opt-out of receiving this information by sending an email to [remove@nhra.com](mailto:remove@nhra.com).

You have the option to agree to let us collect your personal information for activities on our web sites, but to not allow us to disclose the information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. To prevent disclosure to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes, please advise us by emailing us at nothirdparties@nhra.com.

We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to enforce our terms or policies; to protect the security or integrity of our web sites and Mobile Apps; and to protect us, our users or the public from harm or illegal activities.

**Can You Review Your Personal Information?**

Yes. You can review personal information you have submitted online. To review personal information submitted to us, we need to verify your identity, so send us a written request by mail to NATIONAL HOT ROD ASSOCIATION, Privacy Policy, 2035 Financial Way, Glendora, CA 91741, asking us to provide a complete copy of your personal information.  Tell us whether you want to receive the information by email and if so include your email address, or by regular mail and if so include you mailing address.

**What Other Information Do We Automatically Collect From Your Computer?**

NHRA may collect information through IP addresses or environmental variables. An "IP address" is a number used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. "Environmental variables" include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our web site, type of web browser and browser language, operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the web site you left to visit NHRA, the names of the pages you visit while at our web sites, the Internet address of the web site you then visit and geo-location information. We collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your interests, to better target marketing and advertising materials, and to enhance your experience on NHRA's web sites. This information may be aggregated in an anonymous manner.

**What is a Cookie, and How Do We Use Them?**

A "cookie" is a small text file that a web site can place on your computer's hard drive. The cookie transmits this information back to the web site's computer, which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. NHRA may use cookies to help us recognize you when you come back to our web sites. We may also use cookies to help us track traffic on our web sites. This information may be aggregated in an anonymous manner. This will help us better tailor our site and provide you with offers that we think may be of interest to you and to better target marketing and advertising materials. We do not link cookie information to personal information. We may contract with third-party service providers such as Google to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.  These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us with our business and operations.  Currently the NHRA does not honor Do Not Track requests.

**Can You Refuse To Accept Cookies?**

Most browsers can be set to refuse to accept cookies. Doing so will not interfere with your ability to visit our web sites, but may restrict our ability to direct you to content on our web sites that is most relevant to you. 

**How Is My Information Kept Secure?**

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. All information you provide on our websites is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls, and if it is supplied via our mobile app, that is handled by Apple and Google. Any payment transactions, user names and passwords will be encrypted [using SSL technology] and all wireless connections are authenticated and encrypted. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where you have chosen a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We expect you to not share your password with anyone.

**What About Information Shared via Social Media?**

You may choose to provide your user name for social media (such as Facebook or Twitter) and submit comments to be posted to social media. You have sole control of any information you choose to post publicly.  Your information is never posted publicly unless you initiate, compose, and confirm the sharing activity. Again, we encourage you to read the privacy practices and policies of any third parties before providing information to them. 

**Will This Privacy Policy Change?**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will do so by providing notice of such changes on our home page and in our online forms requesting personal information. If we make any material changes in the way we use or disclose information about you, we will notify you with an email message to you. If you do not wish us to use your personal information, then please go to [remove@nhra.com](mailto:remove@nhra.com) and ask us to delete, edit, update or remove any information at that time.

**NOTICE TO PARENTS OF YOUR CHILDREN'S PRIVACY RIGHTS AND OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES**

**An Important Note to Parents**

We are a  **general audience web site**  with a children's section. Because we understand that our entire web site may be appealing to children, we seek to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires parental consent before we collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 or disclose such information to any third parties. More information about this law can be found at[http://www.ftc.gov/.](http://www.ftc.gov/)

Children under the age of 13 are not authorized to submit personal information online without first getting the permission from a parent or guardian.

We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. Parents should be aware that software tools are available online that permit them to screen objectionable content and to prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. However, the best protection for your child is for you to supervise your child's online activities.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about how personal information collected on our web sites is used, you can contact us by e-mail at [digital@nhra.com](mailto:digital@nhra.com), or by regular U.S. mail to:

**Why Should I Read This Notice?**

We want you to understand how we collect and use information from visitors on our web sites. This notice explains what kind of information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it to others. If you give us permission to collect or use personal information from your child under age 13 and we make any material changes in how we plan to use that information, we will notify you of this change and require that you give us renewed permission for these new uses.

**What is Personal Information?**

"Personal information" is information that identifies a person or allows a person to be located. Examples of personal information include a name, a home address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, photograph, or a Social Security number.

**When Do We Collect Personal Information from Your Child and What Kind of Information is Collected?**

There are several forums in which we may actively collect information from your child under age 13, including: Jr. Membership, E-Newsletter, Contests and Polls, and the NHRA Store.

**1\. Jr. Membership**

We collect personal information from your child when your child registers to become an NHRA member. Specifically, we collect your child's name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender and we may obtain credit card information to process the membership application. We also collect personal information from your child (i.e., name and mailing address) when your child requests that NHRA's Jr. Membership driving participants waiver forms be sent to them by mail.

**2\. E-Newsletter**

We collect personal information from your child when your child requests to be added to the NHRA E-Newsletter mailing list. Specifically, we collect your child's name and e-mail address.

 **4\. NHRA Store**

When your child wants to buy a product offered from our online NHRA store, we also collect the personal information necessary for the transaction such as name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information.

**What Do We Do With the Personal Information We Collect?**

We may use the personal information we collect from your child to respond to user requests (e.g., to be added to the E-newsletter mailing list, to contact the winner of a prize, to keep membership records, or to verify or process transactions), or to provide children with information requested in a one-time transaction (e.g., responding to an inquiry about NHRA's next race event or location to purchase products). Personal information collected to comply with a child's one-time request will be discarded after NHRA has responded to the child's request. Non-personally identifying information, such as session cookies, will be used to help us improve and update our web sites based on recorded use. NHRA cannot, and does not, condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

**Do We Disclose Personal Information About Your Child?**

We may disclose information we collect about your child from a membership transaction in the form of a member/subscriber record to other third party companies by way of sale, lease or rental agreement. The types of businesses in which such third parties are engaged include the following: racing, mail order parts, apparel, publishing, and other or related similar third-party marketers.

We may disclose the name and age of a winner of a NHRA contest in any of NHRA’s publications in print or online or display it on our web sites.

Of course, online purchases require us to disclose necessary payment information to payment processors. We also may use third parties to send you the products you purchase, in which case we would provide them with your name, mailing address, and other information necessary to complete your order.

Agreements with third parties will provide that such third parties will not use or disclose the information for purposes other than those purposes contracted for, and will also require the third parties to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information.

You have the option to agree to let us collect your child's personal information for activities on our web sites, but to not allow us to disclose the information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. To prevent disclosure to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes, please check the appropriate box in our parental consent form.

**Disclosure Without Consent.**

In certain limited circumstances, we may collect and disclose personal information from your child without first obtaining your consent. These circumstances are described as follows:

It will be necessary for us to collect your child's name and online contact information, and the name and online contact information of the child's parent, in order to provide the parent with notice of our information practices and to seek the parent's consent for the collection and/or disclosure of information about the child. Should any child's parent not respond within ninety days thereafter, then we will delete that child's and his/her parent's information at that time.

We may collect your child's name and online contact information in order to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request from your child (i.e., upon request from the child, we may e-mail to the child information about our web sites). After responding the child's name and information will be deleted.

We may collect your child's and parent's name and online contact information in order to respond directly more than once to a specific request of the child (i.e., to provide membership publications, or a contest entry and subsequent award), but in these cases the child must first be registered with us as a Jr. Member as required under this Privacy Policy before we will respond.

Under certain circumstances we may collect and/or disclose information as is necessary to protect the safety of a child participating in our web sites, or to comply with law or legal process, or to protect the security and integrity of our web sites.

**Can You Review Personal Information Your Child Submitted?**

Yes. You can review personal information your child has submitted online. To review personal information your child has submitted to us it is first necessary for you to provide us information to verify your identity as the child's parent or legal guardian.
