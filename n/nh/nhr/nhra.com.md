**NOTICE TO PARENTS OF YOUR CHILDREN'S PRIVACY RIGHTS AND OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES**

An Important Note to Parents

We are a **general audience web site** with a children's section. Because we understand that our entire web site may be appealing to children, we seek to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires parental consent before we collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 or disclose such information to any third parties. More information about this law can be found at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm>. 

Children under the age of 13 are not authorized to submit personal information online without first getting the permission from a parent or guardian. 

We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. Parents should be aware that software tools are available online that permit them to screen objectionable content and to prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. However, the best protection for your child is for you to supervise your child's online activities. 

If you have any questions about this policy or about how personal information collected on our website is used, you can contact us by e-mail at [policyquestions@nhra.com](mailto:policyquestions@nhra.com), or by regular U.S. mail to:

**1\. Jr. Membership**

We collect personal information from your child when your child registers to become an NHRA member. Specifically, we collect your child's name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender, and may obtain credit card information to process the membership application. We also collect personal information from your child (i.e., name and mailing address) when your child requests that NHRA's Jr. Membership driving participants waiver forms be sent to them by mail.

From time to time, we offer polls or surveys on the NHRA website. Our site will prevent multiple votes made by the same IP address, but no personal information is collected.

Personal information collected to comply with a child's one-time request will be discarded after NHRA has responded to the child's request. Non-personally identifying information, such as session cookies, will be used to help us improve and update our site based on recorded use. NHRA cannot, and does not, condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

Should any child's parent not respond within ninety days thereafter, then we will delete that child's and his/her parent's information at that time. 

We may collect your child's name and online contact information in order to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request from your child (i.e., upon request from the child, we may e-mail to the child information about our website). After responding the child's name and information will be deleted.
