**Our privacy policy is straightforward:**  
NVISH is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Our privacy policy is straightforward - We do not collect/store your personal information, when you visit our website(s), unless you volunteer to provide that information to us. 

The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy during your visit, and handle the information we gather.

Information on our website(s) is gathered in two ways: (1) Information stored automatically (for example, through our site's technology); and (2) Information collected with consent (for example, when you voluntarily provide information).

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

We collect information from you, when you visit our website(s), to browse, read, or download information. Even if you do not register for any of our services, we gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and/or to administer our Web site. This helps us identify the pages which our users are visiting.

The kind of information that we may gather automatically includes the type of browser you are using (e.g. Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of Operating System you are using (e.g. Windows '98 or Mac OS) or the domain name of your Internet Service Provider (e.g. AOL, Satyam Online, Comcast, VSNL, etc.), the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. We utilize this non-personally identifiable information to primarily improve our website(s) design, content, and browsing experience.

This site may contain links to other sites. NIVSH Group is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Personal Information Collected**

We collect your personal information, only if you provide it voluntarily. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected include name, address, E-mail address, and information about your interests in using various services.
