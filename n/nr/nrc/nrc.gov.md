For site management, NRC maintains an operational log of site user addresses.

## **Use and Privacy of Information Sent via E-mail or Online Form**

### **Submissions Are Voluntary**

Information you submit through this Web site is voluntary, unless otherwise stated at the point of submission.

### **Public Disclosure of Submitted Information**

Your submissions **may** be made public unless, at the point of collection, we have stated the information will be maintained in an NRC Privacy Act system of records or unless you seek protection of the information under [Section 2.390 of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part002/part002-0390.html) (Public inspections, exemptions, requests for withholding). 

If you send us an e-mail or online form that includes personally identifiable information (for example, your e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number), your information will be used for the purposes described at the point of collection, such as to send information to you, or to respond to your questions or comments. Your submission may also be shared with other NRC offices to fully respond to your request or comment. Your submission, including personal information, may be shared, too, with other Federal or State agencies, the Congress, NRC licensees, or others, if necessary, to address matters raised in your submission.

Any comments that you submit to the NRC on a proposed rulemaking, petition, or other document for which public comment is requested **will** be made public, including any personally identifiable information you include in your submission.

## **Protection of Submitted Information from Public Disclosure**

### **A. NRC Privacy Act System of Records**

If any personal information you provide will be maintained in an [NRC Privacy Act system](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/foia/privacyact-system-of-records.pdf) of records you will be notified at the point of collection, through a Privacy Act statement, of the following: which system of records the information will be maintained in; the authority for and purpose of the system; statutorily-mandated disclosures and authorized routine uses; and the safeguards of the information, subject to the [Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/foia/privstat.html). The Privacy Act statement will also inform you whether providing information is mandatory or voluntary and the effects of not providing all or any part of the requested information. Information on [NRC's Privacy Act regulations](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part009/), can be found at [Part 9, Subpart B of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part009/) _._

### **B. Section 2.390 Public Inspections, Exemptions, Requests for Withholding**

Under [Section 2.390 of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part002/part002-0390.html) NRC may make submissions of information to the NRC publicly available unless the submitter specifically requests the agency not to do so. To withhold information from public disclosure on the grounds that it contains trade secrets or privileged or confidential, commercial, or financial information, an affidavit justifying the request to withhold information from public disclosure must accompany the submitted information.

We do not sell any personal information to third parties.

## **Retention and Disposal of Information Submitted at this Site**

Retention and disposal of electronically submitted information depend on the subject matter and is handled according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules.

## **Children's Privacy**

We do not solicit information from children. If teachers or parents have questions or comments, they should contact an [NRC Public Affairs Officer](https://web.archive.org/what-we-do/public-affairs/contact-opa.html).

## **Use of Cookies**

"Cookies" are small bits of text that are used either for the length of a visit ("session cookies") or saved on a user's hard drive to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies"). We use "session cookies" as place-keepers to retain context during an individual user session. They assist with movement throughout the site during that visit without any capacity to track users over time and across different Web sites. Session cookies are deleted at the end of a visit or they expire in a short time. They are not used to track personal information.

We do not use persistent cookies or other persistent tracking technologies at this Web site.

## **E-Mail Notification of Employment Opportunities**

Each registered user of our [NRCareers](http://www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/employment/nrcareers.html) site may elect to be notified by e-mail whenever we issue an employment opportunity that meets criteria set by the user. The user may also modify the notification criteria or stop receiving the notifications at any time. For more information, see **Change your Notification Preferences** in the Registered Users section of [How to Use _NRCareers_](https://web.archive.org/who-we-are/employment/nrcareers/how-to-use.html#registered).

## **Security**

For site security purposes and to ensure that this site remains available to all users, NRC employs software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or to otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations and the gathering of site usage statistics, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with guidelines approved by NARA.

## **Privacy Impact Assessments Performed**

Access our [Privacy Impact Assessment](https://web.archive.org/who-we-are/privacy-impcat-asess.html) page for assessments made by NRC before developing or procuring information technology (IT) that collects, maintains, or disseminates personal information in identifiable form about members of the public.
