## **Use and Privacy of Information Sent via E-mail or Online Form**

### **Submissions Are Voluntary**

Information you submit through this Web site is voluntary, unless otherwise stated at the point of submission.

### **Public Disclosure of Submitted Information**

Your submissions **may** be made public unless, at the point of collection, we have stated the information will be maintained in an NRC Privacy Act system of records or unless you seek protection of the information under [Section 2.390 of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part002/part002-0390.html) (Public inspections, exemptions, requests for withholding). 

If you send us an e-mail or online form that includes personally identifiable information (for example, your e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number), your information will be used for the purposes described at the point of collection, such as to send information to you, or to respond to your questions or comments. Your submission may also be shared with other NRC offices to fully respond to your request or comment. Your submission, including personal information, may be shared, too, with other Federal or State agencies, the Congress, NRC licensees, or others, if necessary, to address matters raised in your submission.

Any comments submitted to the NRC will generally be made public, including any personally identifiable information included in a submission. Unless excluded pursuant to an order of the Commission, an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, or a Presiding Officer, documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in NRC's Electronic Hearing Docket that is available to the public. Therefore, hearing participants should not include personal privacy information, such as social security numbers and dates of birth, in their filings.

## **Protection of Submitted Information from Public Disclosure**

### **A. NRC Privacy Act System of Records**

If any personal information you provide will be maintained in an [NRC Privacy Act system](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/foia/privacy-systems.html) of records you will be notified at the point of collection, through a Privacy Act statement, of the following: which system of records the information will be maintained in; the authority for and purpose of the system; statutorily-mandated disclosures and authorized routine uses; and the safeguards of the information, subject to the [Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/foia/privstat.html). The Privacy Act statement will also inform you whether providing information is mandatory or voluntary and the effects of not providing all or any part of the requested information. Information on [NRC's Privacy Act regulations](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part009/), can be found at [Part 9, Subpart B of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part009/) _._

### **B. Section 2.390 Public Inspections, Exemptions, Requests for Withholding**

Under [Section 2.390 of Title 10 of the _Code of Federal Regulations_](https://web.archive.org/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part002/part002-0390.html) NRC may make submissions of information to the NRC publicly available unless the submitter specifically requests the agency not to do so. To withhold information from public disclosure on the grounds that it contains trade secrets or privileged or confidential, commercial, or financial information, an affidavit justifying the request to withhold information from public disclosure must accompany the submitted information.

We do not sell any personal information to third parties.

## **Retention and Disposal of Information Submitted at this Site**

Retention and disposal of electronically submitted information depend on the subject matter and is handled according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules.

## **Children's Privacy**

We do not solicit information from children. If teachers or parents have questions or comments, they should contact an [NRC Public Affairs Officer](https://web.archive.org/about-nrc/public-affairs/contact-opa.html).

## **Use of Cookies**

"Cookies" are small bits of text that are used either for the length of a visit ("session cookies") or saved on a user's hard drive to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies"). We use "session cookies" as place-keepers to retain context during an individual user session. They assist with movement throughout the site during that visit without any capacity to track users over time and across different Web sites. Session cookies are deleted at the end of a visit or they expire in a short time. We do not use persistent cookies or other persistent tracking technologies at this Web site except for users of our site search. Our site search relies on search technology hosted at www.google.com, which places a persistent cookie in the user's browser to maintain his or her personal preferences and track user trends across multiple sessions whenever he or she performs a search using Google's search technology from a particular computer. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected through the use of this cookie. You may disable cookies in the Web browser’s preferences menu without affecting your ability to perform this type of search. Refer to your browser’s preferences for more information on disabling cookies. The use of persistent cookies will not result in the user receiving pop-up advertisements. The NRC does not have access to the cookie information maintained by Google. You may also view Google’s cookie policy <http://www.google.com/preferences> .

## **E-Mail Notification of Employment Opportunities**

Each registered user of our [NRCareers](http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/employment/nrcareers.html) site may elect to be notified by e-mail whenever we issue an employment opportunity that meets criteria set by the user. The user may also modify the notification criteria or stop receiving the notifications at any time.

## **Security**

For site security purposes and to ensure that this site remains available to all users, NRC employs software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or to otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations and the gathering of site usage statistics, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with guidelines approved by NARA.

## **Privacy Impact Assessments Performed**

Access our [Privacy Impact Assessment](https://web.archive.org/about-nrc/plans/privacy-impcat-asess.html) page for assessments made by NRC before developing or procuring information technology (IT) that collects, maintains, or disseminates personal information in identifiable form about members of the public.

## **NRC Plan to Eliminate the Unnecessary Collection and Use of Social Security Numbers**

In response to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) May 22, 2007, memorandum (M-07-16), "Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information," the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established a plan in which the agency will eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of the Social Security number (SSN) by November 22, 2008, in compliance with OMB’s eighteen month time frame. For more details please see [ML072640250](http://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/idmws/ViewDocByAccession.asp?AccessionNumber=ML072640250).

## **NRC Personally Identifiable Information Breach Notification Policy**

In accordance with established policy, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) actively protects personally identifiable information from access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized individuals. The purpose of this document is to reiterate policy and establish standardized response and notification procedures for breaches of that policy. In the event of a breach in PII security requirements, agency personnel are to comply with the following procedures for response and notice to affected individuals, other Federal agencies, and the media, as appropriate. These policies and procedures govern breaches by agency personnel that may result in unauthorized access, either internal or external to the NRC, whether involving electronic systems or paper documents. For more details, please see [ML083650337](http://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/idmws/ViewDocByAccession.asp?AccessionNumber=ML083650337).
