# NRC: Privacy Statement

[Home](https://web.archive.org/) > [Site Help](https://web.archive.org/site-help.html) > Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our web site. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

**If you visit our site** , we collect and store only the following information about you:

  * The IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet) from which you access our web site;
  * The pages you visit; and
  * The date and time you access our site.



**If you send us an email message or on-line form that includes personal information** (for example, your e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number), we will only use the information for the reason you provided it. However, if you are commenting on a proposed rulemaking or petition, all information submitted in your comments, including personal information will be posted at the [Current NRC Rulemakings](http://ruleforum.llnl.gov/cgi-bin/rulemakedc?type=norisk) Web page. Personal information will not be removed.

**Use of Cookies**

NRC may use "session cookies" as place-keepers to retain context during an individual user session. They assist with movement throughout the site during an individual user session without any capacity to track users over time and across different web sites. Session cookies are discarded on completion of a user session or expire based on a short time frame and are not used to track personal information.

**What NRC Does with Site Usage Data**

For site management, NRC maintains an operational log of site user addresses. This log is used to generate site usage statistics, to track operational problems, and to investigate suspected unauthorized activities. Information about individual users is shared only with appropriate law enforcement entities if necessary to investigate or prosecute unlawful activities conducted on or against this site.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this site remains available to all users, NRC employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or to otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations and the gathering of site usage statistics, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with [National Archives and Records Administration](http://www.archives.gov/records_center_program/index.html) guidelines.
