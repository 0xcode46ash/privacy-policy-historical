# Privacy Policy | National Republican Congressional Committee

Welcome to the official Web site of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The NRCC knows your right to privacy is important, especially online. This privacy policy has been created to answer any questions you may have regarding the NRCC's data collection and protection policies. 

**What information is being collected at www.NRCC.org?  
**

The only personal information collected is information you give us. In an effort to grow our Republican grassroots community online, the NRCC may ask you to submit information. This information will be used to provide you with information about online events, personal appearances, TV appearances, talking points, and other Republican related information. You do not have to provide this information – we only ask that you do so that we can better communicate with you!

Some information must be collected when you make a contribution. When you make contributions to the NRCC that aggregate to more than $200 in a single election cycle, federal law requires us to use our "best efforts" to collect your name, mailing address, employer, and occupation. Any credit card information provided is only used to immediately process your donation. The NRCC does not retain credit card information once the donation is processed online.

We ask that children under 18 do not submit their information. In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), www.NRCC.org does not knowingly collect information from children. In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), the NRCC will never knowingly collect personal identifiable information from persons thirteen years old or younger.  
 

 **How is the information collected at www.NRCC.org used?  
 **

We will not sell your personal information. Under no circumstances will the NRCC sell your information to third parties or any commercial entities. 

We may share your information with like-minded organizations. The NRCC may share information -- that you voluntarily provide us -- with like-minded organizations committed to the principles or candidates of the Republican Party, Republican State Party organizations and local Republican groups. The NRCC may provide your email address or other personal information to authorized third parties required to deliver a particular service. These third parties may not use said information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for the NRCC.

 **  
Is my information secure?**

Protecting information you provide is important to us. The NRCC makes every effort to protect your information from the moment you enter your information to when it is stored on our secure servers. www.NRCC.org uses a secure socket layer (SSL) – with the highest level of encryption commercially available – on pages where online visitors register or make a secure online donation using their credit card. Strict security measures are in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of any and all information pertaining to www.NRCC.org 

www.NRCC.org uses a secured/encrypted server for online credit card donations. The online contribution form is in compliance with FEC regulations. The NRCC has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to prevent unauthorized access.
