## PRIVACY STATEMENT

### Our Commitment to Privacy

The _**NRMP**_ takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the safety and security of its website and information collected through the website. We recognize that users of the website and participants in _**NRMP** _surveys may have questions about how and why this information is collected. This Privacy Notice explains what kinds of information we collect and how we use this information, and describes your and our legal rights and responsibilities with respect to your personally identifiable information, which we will call “personal information” in the text below. This Privacy Notice is part of the terms and conditions that govern your access and use of our website. If you are unable or unwilling to agree to all the terms and conditions below, please do not access or use our website or you will have agreed to fully comply with all of our terms and conditions, including this Privacy Notice, and consented to the collection and use of your personal information as described below. We will refer to access, use, transmission, and exchanges of information, availability or utilization of features, functions or activities, simply as “use” in the material below.

The **_NRMP_** recognizes it has a responsibility to treat with care the personal information it collects about individuals and institutions involved in medical education arising from use of our website and to respect their privacy relative to personal information that may be sensitive. To meet those obligations, the _**NRMP**_ has developed policies designed to prevent the disclosure, compromise, and unauthorized use of personal information without the permission of the individual involved, to limit the distribution of personal information to those situations that require it in order to perform our obligations related to your use of our website, and to permit distribution of non-personal information, such as directory information, wherever a useful purpose can be served.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

### Personal Information

As part of its Matching Program, the _**NRMP**_ collects certain personal information to provide you with the services requested and to engage in research for specific, defined purposes. Such personal information may include names, identification numbers, contact information, institutional affiliation, and other biographical information. This information is collected only through our password-protected website, the Registration, Ranking, and Results® (R3®) system.

In addition to using it for our Matching Program, your information also may be used by the _**NRMP**_ for educational research or verification purposes or under restricted conditions by third parties as explained below in Data Sharing with Third Parties.

_**NRMP**_ surveys are designed to collect data for educational and research purposes, including reporting to _**NRMP** _constituents and providing summary information to the U.S. Congress and other policymakers. From time to time, the _**NRMP**_ may contact you to participate in such a survey. Whenever the _**NRMP**_ conducts research using personally identifiable data (human subjects research), that research is reviewed by an external (to the _**NRMP**_ ) institutional review board whose responsibility it is to protect your interests.

The _**NRMP**_ reserves the right to use personal information in its databases to confirm the identity of parties who may have made or attempted to make unauthorized or inappropriate use of _**NRMP**_ services or assets or who may be a threat to public safety, including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, unauthorized use of _**NRMP**_ services, systems and/or networks, inappropriate email list activity, unauthorized use or distribution of _**NRMP**_ intellectual property, or threats to the safety or privacy of the public. Contact information will be used to provide notice to the offending individuals and in such cases, personal information may be given to law enforcement if warranted or required by law.

**Credit Card Information**

Once your credit card information has been passed to the credit card processing company for verification, we retain only a limited amount of the credit card information (e.g., several digits but not all of your credit card number and your address when available). Any credit card information we retain is kept within a secure, limited-access database. It is not shared with anyone internal or external to the _**NRMP**_ , nor is it integrated with data from other _**NRMP**_ databases.

### Web Site Usage Information

Email addresses, aggregate information about which pages visitors access, and information volunteered by website visitors—such as user survey responses and website registrations—are used to improve the content of the _**NRMP**_ website. Some portions of our website use information tracking technology (“cookies”) to improve your experience and to help us administer, operate, and manage our website more efficiently. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it, but if you choose not to accept them, your use of the website may be limited and you may be required to re-enter certain information each time you wish to use our website.

### Data Sharing with Third Parties

Information published by the _**NRMP**_ that is related to its Matching Program is accomplished using aggregate statistics. The **_NRMP_** may share personal information with certifying boards, licensing bodies, and other organizations involved in medical education for research, eligibility determination, verification, and credentialing purposes. Personal information also may be shared with medical education institutions upon direction by you as part of the registration or application process or for scholarship opportunities. The **_NRMP_** shares both non-personal and personal information with these parties under certain limited restrictions, including requirements to keep the personal information confidential, destroy the personal information once it no longer is needed for the intended purpose (except for applications to medical education institutions), and to prevent unauthorized release of personal information. The _**NRMP**_ conducts such exchanges in a secure manner designed to protect against access by unauthorized parties. Rank order list information is never shared with third parties, except under court order or in response to a subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than for the specific purposes noted in this Privacy Notice or in any terms and conditions that otherwise apply to you, we do not share personal information and we never use or share any of your personal information for advertising or marketing purposes.

### Security of Collected Data

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and facilitate the correct use of personal information obtained through our website, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect online. Access to personal information is restricted to _**NRMP**_ staff members who require the access for specific purposes, such as providing services to you or performing research.

Messages you send to us through the Internet or otherwise electronically may not be secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential information to us by email. If you choose to send confidential information to us, you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information.

### How to Access or Correct Your Information

Access to your personal information is available through your _**NRMP**_ login (username and password). When you register for an _**NRMP**_ match, you have an opportunity to correct or update most information you have provided using our website. In the alternative and in some cases to correct or update certain types of information (e.g., date of birth, name), you may contact the _**NRMP**_ directly at the address below to report corrections.

To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections following such a request.

### Protecting Your Personal Information Online

Although the _**NRMP**_ **__**takes measures designed to protect your personal information in their systems, you also must be vigilant in protecting access to your information online and assume responsibility for protecting personal information. Treat your user names and passwords with care. Do not share them or enter them into fraudulent sites. Be aware that the legitimate ** _NRMP_  **is “nrmp.org”.
