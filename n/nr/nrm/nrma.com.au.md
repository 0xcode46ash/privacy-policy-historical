### How information is collected

Information that is not capable of identifying you, such as the number of users visiting this website, is collected through code embedded in the webpages of this website. You cannot disable the code on these pages.

Other information, such as browser type, is included in a ‘cookie’ that is sent to your computer when you are completing certain tasks on this website. A cookie contains bits of information that enables our servers (ie. the computers that house this website) to identify and interact efficiently with your computer. Cookies are designed to provide a better, more customised website experience, and to make it easier for you to use this website.

You can configure your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. The ‘help function’ on your browser will provide you with details on how to change your browser configurations. You will need to accept cookies in order to use some functionality on this website.

We may also use technologies similar to cookies in emails you receive either directly from us or from third party email providers sending emails on our behalf. These technologies help us understand whether you have opened the email, and how you have interacted with it. They also help us understand what you may find of interest and can assist us, for example, in tailoring the advertising we display to you on websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve advertisements. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way you can disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) within your email software, and you should not click on any links within the email (with the exception of the unsubscribe link). You can opt-out from receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the email.

This information includes information such as the number of users and pages viewed and the path taken through this website. We use this information for statistical and maintenance purposes. We may also use independent third party suppliers to collect information from emails you receive from us or our email providers.

## _ _ Online Security Statement

This Online Security Statement applies to this website, which is operated and managed by us for us and our related entities. This Online Security Statement supplements and should be read in conjunction with our **Privacy Policy**

We take the protection of your personal information seriously; it is a priority for us. This is why we take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, interference and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  However, no data protection or security measure is completely secure.  Therefore, you must take care to ensure you protect your personal information (for example by protecting your usernames and passwords, policy details, etc) and you should notify us as soon as possible if you become aware of any security breaches.

### Examples of the security measures we have in place

Personal information you provide to us via this website is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our computers. We utilise encryption protocols such as a form of secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to prevent others from accessing your personal information.

Your personal information is stored on computer systems which are protected from unauthorised access by a combination of firewalls, secure logon processes, encryption and intrusion monitoring technologies.

We use a recognised payment service provider to process any insurance payments you make using this website. This service provider is committed to protecting your personal information on our behalf.

We will not ask you to provide or confirm personal information via email. An email purporting to come from us that does so should be discarded as it is likely to be an attempt to steal your personal details (referred to as 'phishing').

In certain circumstances we will collect and use your IP address to protect the security of our website.
