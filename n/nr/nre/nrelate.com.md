#### Privacy Policy

##### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, nrelate collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. nrelate' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how nrelate' visitors use its website. From time to time, nrelate may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

nrelate also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. nrelate does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

##### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to nrelate.com choose to interact with nrelate in ways that require nrelate to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that nrelate gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our mailing list to provide an email address. In this case, nrelate collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with nrelate. nrelate does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

##### Aggregated Statistics

nrelate may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, nrelate may monitor the most popular blogs on nrelate.com. nrelate may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, nrelate does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

##### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

nrelate discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that 

(i) need to know that information in order to process it on nrelate' behalf or to provide services available at nrelate' website, and   
(ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.   
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using nrelate' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

nrelate will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations , as described above, nrelate discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when nrelate believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of nrelate, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an nrelate website and have supplied your email address, nrelate may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with nrelate and our products. We primarily only communicate to you via your email address for the purpose of our monthly newsletter.   
nrelate takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
