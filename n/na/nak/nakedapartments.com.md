# Privacy Policy | Naked Apartments

At Naked Apartments, Inc. ("Naked Apartments", or "we," "us," or "our"), provider of the nakedapartments.com website (the "Site"), we respect the importance of your privacy, and we are committed to taking steps to ensure that your personal information is kept strictly confidential. We believe that you should know what information about you is collected when you use the Site, including our services through the Site, as well as how that information is used, maintained and, in some cases, shared. Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy to set forth our privacy practices and policies. 

BY USING OR ACCESSING IN ANY WAY THE SITE, OR BY TRANSMITTING INFORMATION TO US BY EMAIL OR OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS, YOU ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR OTHERWISE ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES. 

## INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND SHARING 

When you register with the Site as a subscriber, we collect certain personally-identifiable and sensitive information from you, which we use and provide to others, as follows: 

  * Renter subscribers
    * **Contact Information.** If you fill out a profile with the Site, we collect basic contact information about you (including your name, telephone number and e-mail address) in order to be able to contact you. We will not provide your contact information to other subscribers or non-subscribers. However, if you register as a renter subscriber, subscribers and non-subscribers to the Site will be able to see your [first name, maximum desired rent, annual salary and move date] as part of your public profile on the Site. You may choose to provide your full contact information to subscribed brokers and landlords with whom you wish to conduct business.
    * **Credit/Financial Information.** We collect from renter subscribers, certain credit and financial information (such as your name, current address, date of birth and your social security number) which we use to obtain your credit score from a credit reporting agency. Your credit/financial information will not be disclosed to a third party except only as needed to process the transaction (for example, to the credit reporting agency). Broker and landlord subscribers will be provided with your credit score; however, it will only be associated with your first name unless and until you choose to disclose your contact information to the broker or landlord subscriber. We do not retain your credit/financial information once we obtain your credit score. Also, in establishing your profile on the Site, we require that you give us your income to indicate your income and tell us whether or not you have access to a guarantor and whether you are co-signing. This information will be displayed as part of your public profile on the Site available to broker and landlord subscribers, associated with your first name only unless and until you choose to provide your full contact information to particular brokers and landlords.
    * **Your Apartment Preferences.** As part of establishing your profile on the Site, you will be asked information regarding your apartment preferences, such as location you wish to live in, the maximum monthly rent you wish to spend, apartment size you are interested in and estimated moving date. These preferences will be displayed as part of your public profile on the Site to broker and landlord subscribers but only associated with your first name unless and until you choose to provide your full contact information to particular brokers and landlords.
    * **Broker / Landlord Reviews.** You may also provide reviews on the Site of brokers or landlords after you have worked with them. Any information you provide in these reviews will be displayed to other subscribers of the Site, including your first name. In addition, brokers and landlords will be able to see that you wrote the review.
  * Broker / Landlord Subscriber
    * **Contact Information.** We collect from broker and landlord subscribers, basic contact information (including your name, company name, telephone number and e-mail address) in order to be able to contact you as a subscriber. We will not provide your contact information to other subscribers. However, renters will be able to see your first name and associated brokerage firm as part of your public profile on the Site. You may choose to provide your full contact information to renters with whom you wish to conduct business.
    * **Listings.** Any listings and related information you upload to the Site will be viewable by renter subscribers.
    * **Reviews from Renters.** You may request renters to provide a review of you on the Site, which will be displayed to others as part of your public profile on the Site available to renter subscribers. 
    * **Credit Card Information.** If you wish to submit any contacts to the Site, we require payment at that time using a credit card. You will be asked to provide a valid credit card number, expiration date, name and billing address. We use this information to process the transaction. We do not store your credit card information after the transaction is complete unless you choose to store this information in order to expedite contacting renters in the future.
    * **Evaluation and Feedback.** If you provide us with your own comments about our services, we may use your comments in our marketing and promotional materials and/or on the Site only if you give us permission to do so.
    * **Special Offers, Promotions, Newsletters and Updates.** If you authorize us to do so in your profile, we will contact you, according to your privacy preferences to inform you of special offers, promotional deals, newsletters, and updates to our service offerings.

## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

In addition to the sharing and disclosure of information described above, we may also share information about you as follows: 

    * **Service Providers.** Naked Apartments uses Service Providers to perform certain of the technical processing, administration and support of the Site and services. Such Service Providers generally are permitted to use and disclose your personally identifiable information only as provided in this Privacy Policy. However, with respect to certain services, some Service Providers may have their own privacy policies that will apply to their use or disclosure of your information obtained through those services. You will be notified of any other privacy policies or terms when you sign up for these services, and you may decline to receive any such service if you do not agree with those other terms.

## LOG FILES

As is true of most websites, Naked Apartments and our Service Provider gather certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating system information, date/time stamps, and clickstream data. We and our Service Providers use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site and services, to track users' movements around the site and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base in aggregate. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that may use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate for marketing research purposes. 

## LINKS TO OTHER SITES

The Site contains links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

In addition, certain Service Providers may have their own privacy policies that will apply to certain services, as described above. 

## SECURITY

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter your personal information onto our query form and upload your document(s), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) with 128-bit (or better) encryption, which is the industry standard for safely delivering your details. Naked Apartments follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we cannot, therefore, guarantee the absolute security of anything transmitted via the Internet, you may take comfort in knowing that Naked Apartments uses commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you are always welcome to contact us at info@nakedapartments.com. 

## BUSINESS TRANSITION

In the event that Naked Apartments goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. This Privacy Policy will become binding upon the new owner of the information until amended.
