### Privacy Policy

Naruto Chaos is firmly committed to your privacy. This privacy policy briefly outlines our stance on privacy and how we collect and handle your personal information. You should read and understand this policy before creating an account on our website. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at privacy@narutochaos.com.

**Personal Information**  
Naruto Chaos will never sell, give, or in any way intentionally distribute or share any of your personal information with any advertizer or third party. We collect only what personally identifiable information is necessary. We ask that you provide a valid e-mail address upon registration for an account. This may be used to recover your password should you lose or forget it. Naruto Chaos will not e-mail you without your consent.

**Tracking**  
The Naruto Chaos server keeps track of certain actions that you may perform on our site, but only those that are necessary. For example, when you download a large file from our site, a temporary record is created showing when you downloaded that particular file. Old download records are cleaned daily. Naruto Chaos does not track other activity on our site, such as viewing pages, in any personally identifiable manner.

**Cookies**  
The Naruto Chaos web site makes use of at most two optional cookies. The first contains your "session ID", which is used by our server to determine whether you are browsing as a guest or if you are logged in, and if you are logged in, who you are logged in as. The session ID does not by itself identify you in any way and is deleted upon the closing of your browser or logging out. The second cookie is used by our login system to remember your login and automatically log you in, if you choose to do so. The contents of the cookie is also your session id, but is created if you choose to remain logged, and deleted only when you logout

**Changes**  
This policy may be periodically updated or revised. You should check this policy periodically for changes.
