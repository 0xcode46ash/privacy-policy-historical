About Nabbr

Nabbr is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. Nabbr members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. Nabbr members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them. 

Nabbr cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at privacy@Nabbr.com

Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members Nabbr members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.
