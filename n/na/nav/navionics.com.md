### THE REASON FOR THIS INFORMATION NOTICE

By reason of consulting this site, data relating to people that might be identified could be processed. This page provides a description of the management procedures for the reference site in respect of the processing of the personal data of users who access it. This information notice is in addition to the specific informative documents which are provided to users when requested by the website to submit personal data. This information notice is issued in accordance with article 13 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 – “Code for the protection of Personal Data” - for whoever interacts with the web services of Navionics S.p.A. that are accessible virtually from the following address: [http://www.navionics.com](http://www.navionics.com/) The information notice is issued only with regard to the site of Navionics S.p.a and not also for other web sites that may be consulted by the user through links present in this site. For these sites the user is responsible to check the privacy policy possibly adopted by the same, and Navionics can not be held responsible for the data processing carried out by such sites. The information notice is also based on Recommendation no. 2/2001 issued by the European Union Authorities for the protection of personal data, meeting with the working group established by article 29 or Directive No. 95/46. The Recommendation was adopted on 17 May 2001 to identify certain minimum requirements for the collecting of personal data on-line, and more specifically, the procedures, timing and nature of the information that Data Controllers must provide to users when they connect to web pages, irrespective of their reasons for connecting.

### TYPE OF DATA PROCESSED AND PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING

#### Navigation data

The computer systems and software procedures responsible for the functioning of this web site, acquire certain data during the course of their normal operations, where the transmission of these data is implicit to using Internet communication protocols. This refers to data that have not been collected to be associated with identified parties, but which by their very nature, could allow the user to be identified, through processing and the association of data held by third parties. Falling into this data category are IP addresses used by the users that connect to the site, addresses in URI notation (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the resources requested, the time of the request, the method used in submitting the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numeric code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user's computer environment. These data are used solely for retrieving anonymous statistical information on the use of the site, and to check that it functions correctly. The data are immediately cancelled after processing. Data could be used for checks in the case of presumed IT crimes causing damage to the site: except for this possibility, data on web contacts are currently not kept for more than seven days.

#### Users' e-mail addresses

The optional, explicit and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site will result in the subsequent acquisition of the sender's address, which is necessary to respond to the enquiry, as well as any personal data that may be entered in the communication. Unless otherwise specified, these data shall exclusively be processed for the purpose of answering the enquiry made by the users.

#### Cookies

This website makes use of two persistent cookies. The first one is used for identifying the user's browser preferred language and for remembering the page language of the last page browsed in our site; it is stored and refreshed automatically on each page served by our website. This helps the website in serving the pages according to the language of the user's browser and to keep the language consistent through the browsing. This cookie expires automatically one week after the last page browsed on the site. The second one remembers the regional preference chosen by the user and is stored when the user clicks on a flag on the page footer. This helps the website in serving the pages according to the language manually chosen by the user. This cookie expires automatically one week after the user has clicked on a flag. If the user doesn’t clicks on a flag, the cookie is never created. No user's data is stored on our website. The cookie is on the user's pc and is sent each time to the server; the server reads its content and tries to serve the page requested in the language found in one of the two cookies available. The cookies are not used for other purposes than the one just described.  
The use of so-called session cookies (that are not memorised in a persistent manner on the user's computer and disappear when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to the transmission of session identifiers (consisting of random numbers generated by the server), which are necessary to allow for the safe and efficient browsing of the site. The so-called session cookies used on this site avoid any recourse to other IT techniques that could potentially be prejudicial to the confidentiality of the users' navigation and do not allow to acquire personal data identifying the user.

### PROCESSING PROCEDURES

The data are processed using electronic means, for the time strictly needed to achieve the purposes for which the data are collected. Specific safety measures are observed to prevent the loss of data, unlawful or incorrect use and unauthorised access.

### DATA PROCESSING LOCATION

The processing connected to the web services on this site takes place at the offices of Navionics and at the server farms of Amazon in Ireland and is only attended to by technical staff appointed for the processing, or by those possibly appointed to conduct periodic maintenance operations. No data deriving from the web service are communicated or circulated. The personal data provided by users that send requests for information material to be forwarded, is used for the sole purposes of carrying out the required activity, and are communicated to third parties only in cases where this is necessary for these purposes (by way of example, to shippers or carriers).

### OPTIONAL NATURE OF PROVIDING DATA

Besides what has been specified regarding the navigation data, the user is free to provide the personal data requested by the site during his/her navigation. When requested to provide personal data, the user is always provided with a specific informative document predisposed in compliance with Article 13 of Legislative Decree No. 196/2003, which specifies all the relevant information concerning the processing for which the personal data are requested. Failure to provide these data could make it impossible to obtain what has been requested.

### "OWNER" AND DATA CONTROLLER

The Data Controller is Navionics S.p.A.

### RIGHTS OF RELEVANT PARTIES

As regards navigational data no relevant processing under the meaning of Legislative Decree No. 196/2003 is carried out by Navionics, as regards the other personal data which may be requested to the users during their navigation on this site, the rights of the users are specifically indicated in the informative document which is submitted to the same at the time of the collection of the personal data.
