**Data Collection**

When registering for a newsletter or requesting more information, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as first and last name, email address and company name). We use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest.

You have the option to provide demographic information (such as # of employees, etc.) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our Site.   
NaviSite is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. NaviSite collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Site.

NaviSite does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis. Personally identifiable information is identifying information about an individual such as a name, title, company name, address, email address and phone number.

NaviSite may collect IP addresses and or Domain Names (where applicable) of visitors to the Site, the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or Site registrations. NaviSite may use IP addresses and or Domain Names to help diagnose problems and to administer the Site.

The information gathered may be shared with third parties for commercial purposes for services in which you express interest.

**Microsite **

Access to certain of NaviSite's web pages are accessible only by email invitation containing a link to a private site created specifically for the intended user (the "Microsite"). Information that a user provides to us within the Microsite may be used for permission purposes, tracking information on how often users access their Microsite and which documents they view to give NaviSite feedback on the effectiveness of its content.

**Links to Third-Party Websites**

In the event this Site contains links to other sites owned and maintained by companies other than NaviSite, NaviSite is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such linked sites.

**Use of Cookies**

Users should also be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of the Site web server or through the use of 'cookies.' "Cookies" are used within the Site to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the information on our Site to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

NaviSite does not correlate this information with data about individual users, with the exception of users of our Microsite. NaviSite may provide aggregated cookie data to third parties for analysis purposes. NaviSite is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

If you prefer not to receive cookies on this Site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the NaviSite Site.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by NaviSite only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)  
**  
Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

**Access to Opt Out**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by emailing our Marketing Department at [webinfo@navisite.com ](mailto:webinfo@navisite.com "mailto:webinfo@navisite.com ")or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer provide you services contact us at [webinfo@navisite.com](mailto:webinfo@navisite.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Upon request, NaviSite will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally, upon request, NaviSite will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update or correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous. Users will receive a response from NaviSite within 30 days of submitting their request.

These newsletters provide updates about NaviSite such as press releases, in the news information, and career opportunities. These newsletters are only sent out to users who have specifically signed up and opted-in to these services.

**Security **

NaviSite uses reasonable efforts to treat all consumer information, not just the sensitive and private information mentioned above, in a confidential manner. Only employees who need the information as part of their day to day responsibilities are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

**Notification of Changes**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 9, 2011. Please check our Privacy Policy periodically as NaviSite reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Changes to NaviSite's Privacy Policy will be posted to this Site. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.

**Miscellaneous **

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on NaviSite or its affiliates. This policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
