If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the customer that you interact with directly.

Any personal information that is transmitted in the provision of services will only be processed or retained as long as needed to provide services to our customers.

information on how often users access their Microsite and which documents they view to give NaviSite feedback on the effectiveness of its content.

 **Links to Third-Party Websites**

In the event any NaviSite websites contains links to other sites owned and maintained by companies other than NaviSite, NaviSite is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such linked websites.

Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

 **Use of Tracking Technologies**

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by NaviSite and our partners analytics and online service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

Users should also be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of the websites web server or through the use of 'cookies.' "Cookies" are used within the websites to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the information on our websites to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

NaviSite does not correlate this information with data about individual users, with the exception of users of our Microsite. NaviSite may provide aggregated cookie data to third parties for analysis purposes. NaviSite is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

If you prefer not to receive cookies on NaviSite’s websites, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its

presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of NaviSite’s websites.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our websites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by NaviSite only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our websites by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

 **Security**

NaviSite uses reasonable efforts to treat all consumer information, not just the sensitive and private information mentioned above, in a confidential manner. The organization is driven by policies and controls where data and records are classified and processed appropriately. For example, websites, where technically feasible, enforce the encryption sensitive data in transit using technologies such as secure socket layer (SSL). For managed messaging services, object layer encryption and transport layer encryption (TLS) are used to secure messages. Although NaviSite has a base layer of security for all customers, each environment has addition controls that are sized and positioned based on individual customer requirements. NaviSite observes the core security concept, CIA Triad, of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The policies, procedures, guidelines, baselines, and standards employed by NaviSite in conjunction with the customer’s team follow industry best practices, where feasible. As a result, NaviSite and subsequently customers experience a heightened level of security. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our websites, you can contact [Nav.webinfo@navisite.com](mailto:Nav.webinfo@navisite.com).

 **Notification of Changes**

Please check our Privacy Policy periodically as NaviSite reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes to NaviSite's Privacy Policy will be posted to this website. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage prior to the change becoming effective.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by email or by posting a prominent notice on our websites 30 days prior to implementing the change.

 **Miscellaneous**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on NaviSite or its affiliates. This Privacy Policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [Nav.webinfo@navisite.com](mailto:Nav.webinfo@navisite.com).
