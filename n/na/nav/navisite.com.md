## Security

NaviSite uses reasonable efforts to treat all consumer information, not just the sensitive and private information mentioned above, in a confidential manner. The organization is driven by policies and controls where data and records are classified and processed appropriately. For example, websites, where technically feasible, enforce the encryption sensitive data in transit using technologies such as secure socket layer (SSL). For managed messaging services, object layer encryption and transport layer encryption (TLS) are used to secure messages. Although NaviSite has a base layer of security for all customers, each environment has addition controls that are sized and positioned based on individual customer requirements. NaviSite observes the core security concept, CIA Triad, of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The policies, procedures, guidelines, baselines, and standards employed by NaviSite in conjunction with the customer’s team follow industry best practices, where feasible. As a result, NaviSite and subsequently customers experience a heightened level of security. If you have any questions about security on our websites, you can contact [Nav.webinfo@navisite.com](mailto:Nav.webinfo@navisite.com).

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage prior to the change becoming effective.

If, however, we are going to use users' personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by email or by posting a prominent notice on our websites 30 days prior to implementing the change.

## Miscellaneous

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on NaviSite or its affiliates. This Privacy Policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
