## Information Collection and Use

For site management, visitor information is collected for statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic that identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with [National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs20.html).

The information requested on this Web site is collected in accordance with [Section 503 of Title 10, United States Code](http://uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim), and may only be used to identify and process individuals interested in applying for enlistment or commissions in the United States Navy or Navy Reserve.

Disclosure is voluntary. Declining to provide the information may result in not being contacted by a recruiter, although you may receive recruiting materials in the future. Any information provided is protected from unauthorized disclosure by the [Privacy Act of 1974](http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm).

### Cookies

For site navigation purposes only, cookies are used in a limited manner. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.

Navy.com uses clear GIFs, or pixel tags, provided by our ad-serving company to help manage our online advertising. These clear GIFs allow our ad-serving company to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site. This allows us to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable (it does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address).

### Personally Identifiable Information

Participation in the Navy Chat and any other communication with navy.com is governed by the following guidelines to protect your privacy and security:

Any information and/or personal data you supply via Navy Chat, Membership Account, or email is totally voluntary. You have no obligation to provide information of any type.

Information the United States Navy collects about you from Navy Chat, Membership Account activity sessions or email messages will be used for the purpose of recruiting Enlisted personnel and Officers into the United States Navy and Navy Reserve. Authority for gathering information is granted under [Title 10, United States Code, Section 503](http://uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim).

If you provide any personal history, medical history, contact data or any other information, the United States Navy is bound by federal law to use the information for recruiting purposes only. Federal law further states that the United States Navy will not release any information offered by you to any person or organization outside the Department of Defense.

The United States Navy and Navy Reserve reserve the right to record all activity that takes place in Navy Chat. The raw information obtained may be used by the Navy to provide information services to the public. Raw data logs are used exclusively for this effort and will be destroyed on a regular basis in accordance with [National Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs20.html).

## Freedom of Information Act

The U.S. [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.foia.gov/) is a law ensuring public access to U.S. government records. FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure; the burden is on the government - not the public - to substantiate why information may not be released. Upon written request, agencies of the United States government are required to disclose those records, unless they can be lawfully withheld from disclosure under one of nine specific exemptions in the FOIA. This right of access is ultimately enforceable in federal court.
