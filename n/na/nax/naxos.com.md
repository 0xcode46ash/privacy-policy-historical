In addition to our duty of confidentiality to customers, we shall at all times fully observe the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance ("the Ordinance") of the Hong Kong SAR in collecting, maintaining and using the personal data of customers. 

Customers' personal data are classified as confidential and can only be disclosed by us where permitted by the Ordinance or if we are otherwise legally compelled to do so. 

We only collect personal information to assist us in providing you with services as well as information on services offered by us.

We co-operate with law enforcement agencies as required by law. 

We may employ other companies or individuals to provide certain services such as analysing customer lists, providing marketing assistance or consulting services. These third parties may have access to information needed to perform their function but can not use that information for other purposes. 

All reasonable steps are taken to correct information held where the information is not accurate, up-to-date and complete.
