P3P

P3P is designed to give Web users more control over the use of their personal information collected on web sites they visit. P3P will allow users to easily view the privacy practices of Web sites they are visiting; the user will know what personal information is being collected, for what purposes, and who else is viewing this information. P3P enhances user control by putting privacy policies where users can find them, in a form users can understand, and, most importantly, enables users to act on what they see.
