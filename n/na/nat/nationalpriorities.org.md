# Privacy Policy | National Priorities Project

National Priorities Project is dedicated to honoring the privacy and wishes of our supporters at all times. Following are details about our online policies. These policies may be changed or updated from time to time. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns we will be happy to address them promptly. 

1\. Collection of Personal Data   
National Priorities Project collects and maintains only personal information that is sent to us directly from an individual or company. This information is obtained from the following places:

  * Online donations 
  * Phone and mail correspondence 
  * Sign-in sheets at our workshops and other events 
  * E-mail messages sent directly to our attention 



In addition, we collect aggregate non-personal data on the use of our website, such as statistics on what pages users access or visit, and the referring page from which users find us. This information is used to improve the design and strategy of our website.

2\. "Cookies" and E-mail Addresses  
NPP makes very little use of electronic marking devices ("cookies"), and then only to track non-personal information while a user is visiting our site. The cookie has no meaning outside our site; no personal information or linkage between this number and a particular user is ever made or saved in any form.

Our web server automatically recognizes no information regarding a visitor's e-mail address, unless you have registered with the NPP Database. 

3\. Dissemination of Personal Data  
In the future, National Priorities Project may exchange contact information of our supporters with like-minded organizations. We strive to make it as easy as possible for our supporters to request that their information not be shared, but please feel free to contact us directly about that.

4\. Security of Data Transmittal   
Donations made to NPP via Network for Good are secure to the fullest extent possible.You can recognize secure web pages by checking for the secure symbol at the bottom of your browser screen. For most browsers, this symbol is either a lock or a key. When the lock symbol appears to be locked, the page is secure; when it appears to be unlocked, the page is insecure. 

If you have any further questions regarding our online privacy policies, please feel free to contact us.
