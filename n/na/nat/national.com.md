When you transact business with National Semiconductor our goal is to ensure that your information will be transmitted across the web with the highest degree of security possible. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which encrypts sensitive information such as your name, address, phone number, creditcard etc. Our website also uses the [Verisign digital identification](http://digitalid.verisign.com/server/about/aboutFAQ.htm) service which allows your browser to properly confirm the server you are transacting with is National Semiconductor's server. During the transaction, the server is properly identified with your browser and the information is encrypted before your personal and credit card information is transmitted.

**Please note:** Some corporate firewalls do not support secure-SSL transmissions. If you experience problems when trying to connect using the Secure Sockets Layer(SSL), please contact your internet administrator and confirm if your corporate firewall supports SSL.
