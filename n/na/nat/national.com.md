# National Semiconductor Web Site Private/Security Statement

**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is very important to us. National Semiconductor Corporation, including its worldwide affiliated companies and subsidiaries ("National") adheres to the following privacy policy regarding its collection, use and dissemination of personal and non-personal information collected through its website ("Site"). National reserves the right to modify its privacy policy at any time. By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the policy currently in effect. Any changes to this policy will be posted on our Site so please check back periodically to ensure you have the most current policy statement.

**Collection of Non-Personal Information**

Whenever you visit a web page on the internet, your browser automatically identifies the IP address from where your page request was initiated. It also volunteers certain basic information like browser type, the operating system you are running, and in some cases the page from which you referred to the Site. National's server automatically collects this information and tracks it on a page by page and on a statistical basis.

**Use of Non-Personal Information**

National uses non-personal information such as the region or country of the world from which your IP request emerged to suggest the appropriate language presentation or to select the best promotion aligned to that region of the world. We also use browser type, operating system, and page visits for statistical analysis of site usage and navigation trends.

**Collection of Personal Information**

When you create your personal preferences and workspace with National we will ask for your name, your e-mail address, and when applicable, your billing address, and the address for shipment of your order. National also uses ["Cookies"](https://web.archive.org/en/corporate/cookies.html) to collect personal information about our visitors.

**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

We maintain personal information for statistical purposes to improve our Site for users' needs, to offer products, information and services, contests, sweepstakes or other marketing or promotional activities, to provide customer feedback and support, to administer the Site, to correspond with users and for other purposes related to the reason you gave it to us. We share the information you provide (such as name, company name, address, position, email address, telephone number and telefax number) with National's affiliated companies and subsidiaries within the scope of the above purpose of use. We may entrust the information you provide with third party business partners such as sales representatives, authorized distributors and fulfillment partners to assist us in providing products, information, services or promotions to you, or to manage and improve the Site and database. For example, National may provide your name and delivery address to a shipping company that National uses for delivering products to you. If you agree, we may share your contact information and information relating to your WEBENCH design including design configurations and component bill of materials included in your design selections to third party business partners, such as device manufacturers, sales representatives, distributors and fulfillment partners. Except as outlined in this policy or on our Site, National will not give or sell your personal information to third parties without your consent. We will only use your personal information in the way we specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way your personal information is used without your consent. In special cases, we may need to share information without acquiring consent, such as where required by law, or as provided by, or to enforce, our [Site Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/en/corporate/site_terms.html), or to protect the rights or property of National Semiconductor Corporation. The [Personal Information Protection Management Contact](mailto:phil.gibson@nsc.com) listed below is responsible for the control of personal data.

**Access to Personal Information Stored On The National Servers/Personal Information Protection Management Contact**

You can modify or delete your contact information within the [My Profile](http://www.national.com/profile/user_profile.cgi) page at any time through the My Profile page available as a link in the headers of the Site.

**Correspondence and Notifications**

When you create your Personal Workspace on the Site, you can complete a personal interest profile. Where possible, National uses this interest profile as well as your activity on the Site as collected via Cookies to modify the information delivered to your browser to be more aligned to your interest preferences. National also will use your interest profile and your activity on the Site, to communicate with you over e-mail or to make offers to you during your visits. If you wish us to discontinue sending e-mails to you, we will terminate the activity upon receipt of your request.

**Commerce and Ordering Information**

If you are using a secure server to buy something, we will also ask for your credit card number and expiration date. This information will be used only for the limited purpose of processing your orders.

**External Links**

The Site contains links to third party sites. Since National does not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.

**Security**

When you transact business with National our goal is to ensure that your information will be transmitted across the web with the highest degree of security possible. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which encrypts sensitive information such as your name, address, phone number, credit card etc. The Site also uses the [Verisign digital identification](https://digitalid.verisign.com/server/about/aboutFAQ.htm) service which allows your browser to properly confirm the server you are transacting with is National's server. During the transaction, the server is properly identified with your browser and the information is encrypted before your personal and credit card information is transmitted.

Access to your personal information is limited to National's employees and our services providers who have a justified business reason to access your information consistent with this policy. All personal information is protected through password access and only to identified corporate users.

**Please note:** Some corporate firewalls do not support secure-SSL transmissions. If you experience problems when trying to connect using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), please contact your internet administrator and confirm if your corporate firewall supports SSL.
