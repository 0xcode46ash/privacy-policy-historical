# Privacy Policy: NationalEatingDisorders.org | National Eating Disorders Association

The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through adherence to this Privacy Policy. NEDA provides help and support about eating disorders to those who struggle with the illness, their families and friends, healthcare professionals and others interested in the issue. This Privacy Policy applies to the NationalEatingDisorders.org Website (the “Website”) and provides information about the personal information that NEDA collects from that website, and the ways in which NEDA uses that personal information. It does not describe our practices with respect to information we might collect on or through other National Eating Disorders Association Websites, offline, or through other means.

What information we collect

You can browse content on the Website without revealing any personal information.

From time to time we may provide the opportunity to participate in a survey on the Website, or request or allow you to submit content that may be uploaded to the Website. In doing so, we may ask you for certain information such as your age, gender, race, ethnicity, and your opinions of the website. Participation will be voluntary and, if indicated, anonymous. If anonymous, it will not be linked to any personal information.

Typically, if we provide for the opportunity to make online donations to NEDA, make purchases from NEDA, or participate in auctions or events sponsored by or for the benefit of NEDA, we will do so by providing you with a link through to a secure website (which may be a third party’s website) for the purposes of processing electronic transactions. The types of personal information that would be collected are disclosed prior to or at the time of submission. Please read the privacy policy(ies) and/or data collection practices of any third party site that processes electronic transactions on NEDA’s behalf. We take no responsibility for the security and/or data collection practices of third parties.

Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by on the Website through the use of "Cookies." "Cookies" are files a website can use to track, on a non-personally identifiable basis, repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's access to and use of the site, and allow a site to analyze how visitors are using the site in order to make improvements to the content. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to our use of Cookies. However, if you don’t want information collected through the use of Cookies, you may delete, disable, turn off or reject the Cookies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu on your browser (or as otherwise directed by your browser technology). From time to time certain areas or content of the Website can only be accessed in conjunction with Cookies and you should be aware that disabling Cookies might prevent you from accessing some of our content.

What we do with your information

NEDA does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies or individuals. NEDA may use information collected through its services and the Website for research and development purposes. However, such use will not include any personally identifiable information in such research or analysis. We only use your information for its intended purposes. We will use members’ email addresses to respond to requests and to send updates about new content on the Website and special events organized by NEDA. We may also directly communicate with you concerning non-anonymous surveys or submission of content. Information collected from the Website will be stored as long as NEDA deems reasonably necessary and practicable for the purposes of NEDA, or to otherwise meet legal requirements.

Your personal information will only be accessible to authorized NEDA staff, consultants, agents, subcontractors and professional advisors, all of whom are contractually bound to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy. **You acknowledge, consent, and agree that to the extent legally permissible in each applicable jurisdiction we may access, preserve, and/or disclose the information we collect (including personal information) to a law enforcement agency or another third party if required to do so by law or if we determine access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) respond to claims that any content that you submit violates the rights of third parties; or (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of our visitors (including you) or others.**

Accessing & Correcting Information

You have the right to access, update, request removal of, and correct factual inaccuracies in personally identifiable information that we collect at the Website, subject to the provisions in the preceding Section.

Children’s Privacy

NEDA complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have any information or content from anyone under the age of 13, we will delete that information immediately.

We take security seriously and we will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. NEDA will store all the personal information you provide on its secure servers. Information relating to electronic transactions entered into via this Website will be protected by encryption technology. However, there is no such thing as a Website that is 100% secure. The National Eating Disorders Association cannot, and does not, guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, disclosure, misuse, modification or any other breaches will not occur.

Links to Outside Sites

The Website contains links to other Websites and services that are not maintained by NEDA. These sites have their own privacy policies and/or data collection practices concerning personal or donor information which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage all donors and/or users to learn about the privacy policies and practices of all websites and charities. We take no responsibility for linked sites.

The depiction does not suggest the model’s endorsement of any business, product, service, cause, association, or other endeavors of the NEDA. Nor does NEDA suggest that such person has or had eating disorders, or any other associations with eating disorders, explicit or implied.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time we may decide, or be required by law, to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this policy that may impact how we use personal information we have already obtained, we will update this Privacy Policy by posting a revised Privacy Policy, and, as necessary, notify you as required by law.
