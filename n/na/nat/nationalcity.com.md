**Online Consumer Privacy Principles**

[Link to Security Principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20000226105404id_/http%3A//www.nationalcity.com/ncbe/privacy/security.html)

In recent years, technology has increased the ability of banks to gather, analyze, and distribute consumer information. At National City Bancshares, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (NCBE), we understand and appreciate that our website vistors are concerned about their privacy and the confidentiality and security of information we may obtain about them online. Banks are entrusted to protect consumer information. On the other hand, banks need to have and use information in order to manage risk, as well as to deliver products and services to consumers. In an effort to balance consumers' privacy expectations and the need to use information to conduct our business, NCBE has developed the set of Online Consumer Privacy Principles for our banks set forth below. 

ONLINE CONSUMER PRIVACY PRINCIPLES 

**Expectation of Privacy**  
We understand and respect consumers' expectations of privacy for the sensitive information they have entrusted to us. We maintain policies designed to assure the appropriate use of information about consumers. 

**Collection, Retention, and Use of Consumer Information**  
We collect, retain, and use information about consumers where we reasonably believe that it is helpful to conduct our business, to assess and manage risk, to comply with law and regulation, and to provide products, services, and other opportunities to consumers. 

**Maintenance of Accurate Information**  
We take steps designed to assure that consumer information is current, accurate, and complete in accordance with commercial standards. If you ever find that our records are incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call the telephone number on your account statement. We will investigate and correct inaccuracies in a timely manner. 

**Access to Consumer Information**  
Access to information about consumers is restricted to individuals using it in the legitimate conduct of our business. We emphasize the importance of confidentiality and privacy through training, operating procedures and our policies on ethics. 

**Information Protection**  
We maintain security standards and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access to consumer information. We test and update our technology to provide protection to information about consumers. 

**Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**  
We share information regarding customers among our banking divisions and affiliated companies only in accordance with strict confidentiality policies and with applicable law. We do not reveal specific information about our customers' accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated parties for their independent use, unless (1) our customer has requested it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by our customer; (3) the information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or (4) disclosure is lawfully permitted or required; for example, in connection with litigation, fraud investigation, or potential business purchases and sales. 

**Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Outside Third Parties**  
At times it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about our customers to a third party, such as a vendor or service company that we hire to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential customer information and they must abide by applicable law. 

**Our Commitment**  
As we move forward in developing new products and services in this era of technological change, we will continue to maintain our dedication to our Privacy Principles. We will monitor and update these Privacy Principles from time to time. The most recent version of our privacy principles, along with our "Online Consumer Security Principles", may be found on our web site at www.ncbe.com and www.bankanytime.com.
