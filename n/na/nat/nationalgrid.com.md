## Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. National Grid may set and access National Grid  cookies on your computer.   
Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

### Choices about Cookies

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)   
If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use National Grid products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many National Grid on line services do not require that you accept cookies.

### National Grid's Practices Regarding Cookies 

National Grid uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: 

  * Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customised content. 
  * Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using National Grid's services. 
  * Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic. 
  * Conduct research to improve National Grid's content and services. 
  * Require you to re-enter your National Grid password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.



## Transferring Your Information Outside Of The European Economic Area**

Since National Grid operates globally, it may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other companies within National Grid located in countries outside of the EEA. This may happen where our servers or such companies are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the UK or the EU - in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.

_**The European Economic Area (EEA) currently comprises the Member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein._

## Use Of Your Personal Information Submitted To Other Websites

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other Websites even if you accessed the third party Website using links from our Website or you linked to our Website from a third party Website.

We recommend that you check the policy of each Website you visit and contact the owner or operator of such Website if you have any concerns or questions.

## Privacy Support

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy Statement at any time and in response to changes in applicable data protection and privacy legislation. In the event the Purposes for processing change, then we will notify you as soon as practicable and seek your consent where such notification relates to a new additional purpose for processing.
