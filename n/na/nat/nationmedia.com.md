# Your Privacy

## Your Privacy

Your privacy is as important to us, as it is to you!  We have a simple policy -- **not to release any information regarding your account with us to anyone.  
**   What this means  
---  
  
When email arrives at service we don't take any action or release any account specific information without authentication first.  The same policy is followed regarding telephone requests for information.

If some third party contacts us and expresses a desire to contact you, we do not release any information -- but just tell them there are public sources of information available.  

At times, we have had actual subscribers get frustrated with us because we would not respond to a service request until they had authenticated. IMPORTANT \-- if a person does authenticate we assume they have complete authority over the account.

 Authentication  
---  
  
How do we authenticate ownership? If via E-mail, the message must originate at the one of the contact addresses we have for the account. These were set by you when you established the account, you can check your contact information via your site [control panel](https://web.archive.org/web/20011021131856id_/http%3A//www.nationmedia.com/control-panel.html), make sure it is accurate!

If phone contact is made, or from some other email address -- we will request the person supply us with either the control panel password for the account, or the FTP password. 

If the person does not know any of this information, we can use billing information.  We will ask the person for either the credit card number used to make payments on the account, or the last check number.

If all this fails, we need a letter claiming ownership, with complete and correct address and phone information.

 IMPORTANT  
---  
  
Do NOT release authentication information to third parties. If you temporarily do have to give someone password access to your site. When they are done -- change the password info, remove their email address from your contact information.

Let us know if you have any questions!
