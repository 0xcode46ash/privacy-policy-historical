# National Grid

We are firmly committed to ensure online user privacy. The following passage outlines our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.nationalgrid.com.

Because protecting your privacy is important to us, National Grid does not sell, trade, rent, give or distribute information about you to any third party.

#### Safe Harbor

For personal information of individuals that National Grid receives from the European Economic Area (EEA), National Grid has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles for the transfer of personal information outside of the EEA. National Grid’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at [http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webpages/safe+harbor+list](https://www.export.gov/safeharbor)

#### Security

We use SSL (or Secure Sockets Layer) as our primary form of security protection. A Secure Sockets Layer is a protocol that hides the information sent between the browser and server. An SSL-enhanced browser uses encryption to scramble the transferring data you send to a website into randomized characters for decoding. This is the industry standard for encrypting digital communications between any two points across a network.

Most browsers will illustrate that you are entering or leaving a secure area by presenting a dialog box. However, most browsers give you the option of turning off the dialog box display.

When on a secure page, you will see the lock icon on the bottom of your Internet Explorer or Netscape web browser. Still other browsers have different ways of displaying this information.

#### Online Forms

We use order forms which allow customers to request information and apply for services. When applicable, we collect personal contact information (such as your e-mail address and home address). This information is used to answer your questions, solve your problems, and provide interactivity. We do not provide this information to any other parties.
