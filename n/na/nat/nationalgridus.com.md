# Privacy Policy | National Grid

We are firmly committed to ensure online user privacy. The following privacy policy, together with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Our-Company/Terms-Conditions), outlines our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this website (“site”), www.nationalgrid.com, and our mobile application (“app”).

By accessing and using the site and app, you agree that you have read and understand this privacy policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices and uses or disclosures of information about you that are described herein.

**Safe Harbor**  
For personal information of individuals that National Grid receives from the European Economic Area (EEA), National Grid has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles for the transfer of personal information outside of the EEA. National Grid’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at [https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx](https://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view National Grid’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

**Security**  
We use SSL (or Secure Sockets Layer) as our primary form of security protection. A Secure Sockets Layer is a protocol that hides the information sent between the browser and server. An SSL-enhanced browser uses encryption to scramble the transferring data you send to a website into randomized characters for decoding. This is the industry standard for encrypting digital communications between any two points across a network.

Most browsers will illustrate that you are entering or leaving a secure area by presenting a dialog box. However, most browsers give you the option of turning off the dialog box display.

When on a secure page, you will see the lock icon on the bottom of your Internet Explorer or Netscape web browser. Still other browsers have different ways of displaying this information.

While we have put in place commercially suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on our site and app, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically on our site or app, and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.

**Information We Collect and Use of Your Information**  
We use order forms which allow customers to request information and apply for services. When applicable, we collect personal contact information (such as your e-mail address and home address). This information is used to answer your questions, solve your problems, and provide interactivity. We do not provide this information to any other parties. Additionally, we may collect:

  * Details of your visits to our site or app, and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, including your IP address, the date and time you accessed or left the site or app and which pages you viewed. Some parts of our site or app use cookies and other technologies to collect this information about your general internet usage. See section below ‘Website Cookies’ to learn more.
  * Information that you provide directly to us by filling in forms on our site or app (for example, to contact us, you must provide your name and e-mail address).
  * Information provided to us when you communicate with us for any reason. In addition to using this information to provide services to you, we may use this information to provide third parties with de-identified statistical information about the users of our site and app, and to monitor and conduct an analysis of our site and app traffic and usage patterns.
