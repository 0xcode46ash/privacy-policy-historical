# Scholarships.com Free College Scholarship Search & Financial Aid Information Resource

  
The only information Scholarships.com obtains about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. Our website's personal profile questionnaire requires users to volunteer contact information (name and address for example), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level). We ask if we may make information about you available to our select list of marketing partners (Opt-In/Opt-Out). Scholarships.com is very careful in selecting its marketing partners. We work with reputable, leading companies and organizations that provide products and services that are useful and of interest to students and parents. Marketing partners may be providers of services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. Marketing partners will never be companies or organizations involved with pornography, tobacco or other industries we find to be objectionable or potentially harmful. Though we are selective with whom we partner, we do not control the practices of our marketing partners. 

You may review or update any of your maintained personally identifiable information by visiting "My Profile".   
It is the responsibility of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile to ensure the information they have provided while completing their registration or conducting a scholarship search remains current. 

Users of Scholarships.com may request that the personally identifiable information they have provided be removed from our system at any time by contacting us at [remove@scholarships.com](mailto:remove@scholarships.com). To protect the security and integrity of your information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing access or correction. 

**Opt-In/Opt-Out**

Scholarships.com is able to provide this free service, in part, based on the willingness of our users to receive free information from our marketing partners. When users opt-in, Scholarships.com may make the information they supply available to leading companies who provide information on college admissions and financing, or offers and promotions from organizations providing products and services designed especially for students and parents. 

Scholarships.com understands the importance of personal information. We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer information without the user's permission, and then only in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used by our marketing partners. Users may opt-out, or change their privacy preferences, by clicking here. 

We may communicate with our users through email: to respond to visitor's email, to send information that a user has requested, to inform users of new or updated scholarship awards and financial aid opportunities, or additional education financing information which may be of interest. In the event a user contacts Scholarships.com via email, they will not be subject to receive any communication other than a response to the email, unless specifically requested by the user (i.e.; the user will not be defaulted into receiving any secondary/promotional material).

As such, Scholarships.com will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from, or allow the registration of, children under the age of 13.
