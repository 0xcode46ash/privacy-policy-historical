# National Mortgage News

National Mortgage News (NMN) is committed to protecting your privacy. Our intent throughout our online presence is to collect only the information we need to deliver excellent service, use that information responsibly, and to keep you fully informed how that information is being used.

This policy applies to all pages within the Thomson Media National Mortgage News Web sites, including www.nationalmortgagenews.com, www.mortgagestats.com, www.originationnews.com, www.mortgageservicingnews.com, www.mortgage-technology.com, www.brokeruniverse.com, www.weirdloans.com and www.mortgagegrapevine.com, as well as our e-mail newsletters: the Daily Briefing and the BrokerUniverse Newsletter. 

If you have any questions regarding the information we are gathering, why we ask certain questions, or how we plan to use the information we have requested, and if your answer isn't on this page, please contact Andras Malatinszky, manager of electronic products, by phone at (202) 434-0321 or via e-mail at andras.malatinszky@thomsonmedia.com for a full explanation.

This Privacy Policy covers NMN's treatment of personally identifiable information we collect when you are on the NMN site and when you use our services. This policy also covers our treatment of any personally identifiable information our business partners share with us. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies NMN does not own or control, or to individuals NMN does not employ or manage, including operators of sites to which you may link from the NMN Web sites. 

**What information do we gather?**  
The only personally identifiable information we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration or when responding to offers from NMN or from our business partners. By providing us with your name, address, telephone number, fax and e-mail address, you are agreeing to receive communications sent by NMN or on behalf of Thomson Media and its affiliate companies. We also collect information about aggregate site usage. The statistics we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP addresses, and are not associated with your personal information. 

**How this information is used?  
**· Information gathered at registration is used to identify users who may be interested in hearing from Thomson Media about our products, to collect subscriptions to our free e-newsletters.   
· Information requested for subscription services will be used to provide those services. 

· If you send us email, be aware that your return address will be displayed in the header we receive. We will use this information to answer your inquiry and we may keep your message as a record of our contacts. At no time will we share that information with outside companies or agencies, unless we are required to do so by law or court order. 

· Any identifying information you post to our Web-based bulletin board (Mortgage Grapevine Discussion Group) is public information. Although we make no effort to collect personal information from the boards, other visitors may record your email address, for example, to add to a bulk mail list. You may wish not to post your email address or other contact information in a message, and also not to use your email address as your username. 

**Who has access to this information?**  
· Only NMN staff or related groups or companies of Thomson Media will use information requested, unless you give us your explicit permission to share your information with others. 

· NMN will not share or sell your contact information or any information collected on a company or person visiting our Web site to any outside company, unless you give us explicit permission to do so.

**Changes to the NMN Privacy Policy:**  
NMN reserves the right to introduce new services or practices that may require a change in this policy. We are committed to make the necessary changes promptly to keep you informed on how we use information you give us.
