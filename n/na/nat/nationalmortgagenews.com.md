Thomson Financial Media respects each individual user's right to privacy. Thomson Financial Media may place a "cookie" on the visitor's hard drive in order to facilitate a user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site places on your computer's hard drive for tracking purposes. Thomson Financial Media uses cookie information it receives by placing the cookie on user's hard drive to improve the efficiency of customer service on our online subscription based sites, allowing subscribers to easily change addresses, and add or cancel subscriptions by automatically verifying that you are a subscriber. Thomson Financial Media also uses cookies to enhance our site content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections users visit and which pages. Cookies may also be placed by our advertisers or independent third parties who actually operate the servers on which the ads reside. Although Thomson Financial Media requests such parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, Thomson Financial Media is not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.

Thomson Financial Media collects personal identifying information, when such information is specifically and knowingly provided, from users during (i)contest, survey, sweepstakes or site registration promotions, and (ii) subscription registration for sites or services requiring such registration information. Thomson Financial Media may use this information for marketing and promotional purposes. Thomson Financial Media occasionally informs our users of special deals, new products, and other third party product and service offers that we believe our users will find interesting. Users are given the option to choose whether they would like to receive such mailings upon registration. Individual users can request, at any time, that their information not be used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to Thomson Financial Media at the address given above.

Although it does not currently rent lists of users, Thomson Financial Media may decide in the future to offer companies and organizations that have a product or service believed to be of interest to the user the opportunity to rent our list. Thomson Financial Media may share a user's personally-identifiable information with these companies in an effort to help locate these resources. Thomson Financial Media will, however, offer the user the opportunity to "opt out" of having their personally-identifiable information shared with third parties that are not affiliated with Thomson Financial Media.

If a Thomson Financial Media user knowingly provides personal information such as a user name or e-mail address in a chat or bulletin board area, that user should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by others in that area.

No information should be submitted to Thomson Financial Media by children 16 years of age or under without their parent's or guardian's consent. Thomson Financial Media does not monitor the age of its user audience.
