# NationalJournal.com - Privacy Policy

At National Journal Group we want you to enjoy and benefit from our websites and online services secure in the knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. This policy applies to all National Journal Group websites and online services, including NationalJournal.com, CongressDaily, The Hotline, and 3121. The following explains what information we collect, how we use it and the choices you have

## What We Learn and Collect

### Non-personally identifiable information

The National Journal Group automatically collects certain information that we do not use to personally identify individuals. For example, this site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the site you passed through to reach a National Journal Group website or online service. In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and their areas, very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program.

### Personally identifiable information

The National Journal Group does collect personally identifiable information you provide to us. Information such as your name, organization, address, telephone number and email address, are only collected when, for example, you complete a request for a free trial, subscribe to a National Journal Group product or service, create or edit a profile for certain services or features, or when you post such information to a blog or message board. On certain services such as 3121 where you can register and/or create a personal profile that may be shared with others, you may provide to us other information such as education, political party, work history, religion, birth date, interests, photographs and other information. Information gathered through the use of cookies (defined below) is not related to any personally identifiable details.

The National Journal Group values your privacy and therefore takes reasonable steps to protect the personally identifiable information we hold about you. Nonetheless, you should be aware that profile information in interactive features such as 3121 may be viewable by other users or participants of such services. Similarly, any communications you submit or post to a blog, message board or other interactive feature may be viewable by other participants or users of the service. Therefore, you acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit for profiles or to such interactive features, whether or not it contains personally identifiable information about you. If you make your profile available to other users or if you display your personal information in any communication submitted to any such interactive features, other individuals may collect and use your personal information. We are not responsible for, nor can we guarantee the protection of, any personal information you make available in a profile, that you disclose in a communication submitted to such interactive features for posting, or contained in an email submitted to us for posting, and thus, you acknowledge that if you disclose personal information in any such material, you do so at your own risk.

## Data Security

The National Journal Group has in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. Moreover, we only use that information for legitimate business purposes as further described below, such as (i) to operate the Sites properly; (ii) to protect ourselves, and our visitors; and (iii) to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. However, as effective as the security measures we employ are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, websites or services, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

## How We Use What We Learn

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and to help develop new products. Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers and updates as well as new National Journal Group products that may be of interest to you.

A user's personally identifiable information may be used by National Journal Group to inform you of additional products and services and special and exclusive offers, including through email. Additionally, we may use the information provided by you to: 1) contact you in order to comply with any legal requirements, 2) advise you of any material changes or additions to our service, 3) advise you of account status and 4) for information collection purposes such as to contact you as part of an online survey.

We may share personally identifiable information with our affiliates, business partners or others who work for us such as service providers, vendors, contractors and agents to provide you with services or to contact you for the reasons we have described

## What We Tell Others About You

From time to time, we may also be approached by unaffiliated third parties with an interest in identifying subscribers to National Journal Group publications. We may provide National Journal Group's mailing list (but not email addresses) to such third parties if we believe you would be interested in hearing from them. We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate - not information about you personally - to our partners about how visitors use our websites and online services. National Journal Group from time to time does research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us upon registration, on order forms, as well as from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis and National Journal Group may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses. And in some cases, we may be required by law to disclose information about you to a third party.

To the extent permitted by law, any information collected over our websites or services or concerning their use, including the content of any communication you submit or post to any interactive service and any registration or profile information you have provided (personal and non-personal), may be disclosed to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena or other legal process. We may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to collect debts, fight fraud or protect the rights or property of the National Journal Group and our affiliates, our customers, our websites and services, their users or third parties, or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.

In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, the National Journal Group reserves the right to transfer your personally identifiable information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets

## What Are Cookies And How Do We Use Them?

Our websites and online services places a "cookie" on the browser of a user's computer to gather and store basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. We may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. For example, cookies are used to ensure that subscribers to National Journal Group publications do not have to reenter their login name or password during visits. Cookies are also used to restrict access to bona fide subscribers and to enable you to set up customized alerts that no other subscribers are permitted to see. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies.

Online advertising for the National Journal Group websites and online services is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick, a Google company. This vendor, like other advertising service vendors, places cookies on a user's hard drive so that its systems can identify your computer. By placing such cookies on your system, DoubleClick is able, among other things, to determine automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. It also enables DoubleClick to serve you advertisements tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites you have visited. DoubleClick allows visitors the option to opt-out of advertising cookies. If you do not want the benefits of advertising cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature.
