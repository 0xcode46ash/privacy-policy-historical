# National Journal - National Journal Group's Privacy Policy

At National Journal Group we want you to enjoy and benefit from NationalJournal.com, secure in the knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. The following explains what information we collect and how we use it.

What We Learn

This site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the site you passed through to reach NationalJournal.com. In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to NationalJournal.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program. Information you provide to us, such as your name, organization, address, telephone number and email address, are only collected when you complete a request for a free trial or subscribe to a National Journal Group product or service. Information gathered through the use of cookies (defined below) is not related to any personally identifiable details.

How We Use What We Learn

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and to help develop new products. Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers and new National Journal Group products that may be of interest to you.

A user's personally identifiable information may be used by National Journal Group for editorial purposes, such as to contact you as part of an online survey. Additionally, we may use the information provided by you to: 1) contact you in order to comply with any legal requirements, 2) advise you of any material changes or additions to our service, 3) advise you of account status and 4) inform you of additional products and services, special and exclusive offers.

What We Tell Others About You

From time to time, we may also be approached by third parties with an interest in identifying subscribers to National Journal Group publications. We may provide National Journal Group's mailing list (but not email addresses) to such third parties if we believe you would be interested in hearing from them. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by emailing, calling or writing us (see addresses below).

We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate - not information about you personally - to our partners about how visitors use NationalJournal.com. National Journal Group from time to time does research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us upon registration, on order forms, as well as from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis and National Journal Group may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses. And in some cases, we may be required by law to disclose information about you to a third party.

What Are Cookies And How Do We Use Them?

NationalJournal.com places a "cookie" on the browser of a NationalJournal.com user's computer to gather and store basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. We may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. For example, cookies are used to ensure that subscribers to National Journal Group publications do not have to reenter their login name or password during visits. Cookies are also used to restrict access to bona fide subscribers and to enable you to set up customized alerts that no other subscribers are permitted to see. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by NationalJournal.com by changing the setting on your browser. Some browsers are set to refuse all cookies, or to restrict the conditions under which they are set. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by NationalJournal.com.

Online advertising for NationalJournal.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. This vendor, like other advertising service vendors, places cookies on a user's hard drive so that its systems can identify your computer. By placing such cookies on your system, DoubleClick is able, among other things, to determine automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. It also enables DoubleClick to serve you advertisements tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites you have visited. DoubleClick allows visitors the option to opt-out of advertising cookies. If you do not want the benefits of advertising cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. For more information about DoubleClick's use of cookies, and to "opt-out" of the cookies, visit [www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy)

Advertisers and Links

This site contains links to other sites, including those produced by other organizations. Additionally, National Journal Group advertisers, or websites that have links on our site, may also collect personally identifiable information directly from you. National Journal Group is not responsible for the privacy policies or contents of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access. Please visit the sites of these businesses to review their privacy policies.

Data Security

NationalJournal.com has in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet.

Disclaimer

This Privacy Policy may be changed at any time at National Journal Group's discretion.
