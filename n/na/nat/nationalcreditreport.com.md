# Nationalcreditreport.com

The opportunities you deserve, the privacy you expect  
The purpose of this document is to explain how Nationalcreditreport.com uses your personal information when and after you obtain products or services from us. We want you to know that information given to us is safe, secure and used in a responsible manner.

Nationalcreditreport.com does not share credit report information except as permitted by law. Credit report information includes all information appearing on your credit report which bears on your creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, personal characteristics, or mode of living and that is expected to be used as a factor in establishing your eligibility for credit or insurance (such as your credit score or information about your outstanding debts and payment history).

To offer you all the greatest advantages as a Nationalcreditreport.com customer, we find that sharing limited amounts of your personal information, other than credit report information, within our Nationalcreditreport.com family of companies and with well-respected, carefully selected business partners enables us to offer you personalized products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience than otherwise would be possible.

Your protection is our priority  
We use advanced data-encryption and storage technology to protect your sensitive personal information. Also, we are proud members of recognized online privacy and security organizations such as VeriSignâ„¢, Inc. 

We have implemented extensive administrative, technical and physical safeguards and quality controls. These include:

  * Setting policies and procedures for carefully handling your information
  * Limiting physical access to central facilities through the use of guard personnel and state-of-the-art security systems
  * Requiring third-party business partners to agree contractually to comply with privacy laws to do business with Nationalcreditreport.com
  * Auditing company security practices



Clearly stated policies in our employee handbook, background checks on all employees and thorough on-the-job training in confidentiality and customer privacy ensure that our employees are committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure.

You are protected on the Internet  
Unlike many other companies, Nationalcreditreport.com has designed many features of our website to let you anonymously explore various product and service options and other helpful functions, without revealing your identity. The only information we collect is from "cookies" or similar devices, which provide limited data, such as the date, time and areas of our website that were visited. This general information enables us to serve you better by continually improving our website and making it more convenient. Only when you're ready to order one of our products or services do we ask for identifying information, so that we can quickly process your request.

When you are asked to enter this personal information on our website, our systems automatically switch to "secure" mode. The following security features keep your data safe:

  * Sophisticated, industry-leading encryption and authentication technologies
  * Website design that blocks or limits online display of customer information when not necessary to you or the transaction
  * IDs and passwords to protect sensitive information



Information we gather and communicate  
When you order a product or service from Nationalcreditreport.com, we collect certain data online to verify your identity and process your request. This is to protect you and to help eliminate identity theft and fraudulent orders of credit information.

In order to offer, provide and improve our products and services, to comply with government regulations, and to better understand your credit-related product and service needs, we collect and maintain a range of customer and former customer data including non-public personal information:

  * From applications and other forms (such as your name, phone, Social Security and account numbers and property address)
  * About your transactions with us, our affiliates and our business partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information)
  * From business partners, vendors and service companies (such as your credit report from the national credit bureaus)



We are periodically required to disclose some of this data to third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, and federal and state regulators, in order to do business with you. We may also share some of this information with companies that perform services on our behalf (such as the mail house that prepares and mails new product and service offers) and with third parties, as otherwise required or permitted by law (such as to credit reporting agencies or regulators). These business partners contractually agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose.

Additionally, in order to provide you with valuable product and service offerings, we share limited amounts of this non-public personal information (such as a list of customers in a certain age range or geographic location) with well-respected business partners who are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

You have choices  
Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice of how your nonpublic personal information, other than credit report information, may be shared. Remember, we do not share credit report information except as permitted by law.

You may choose to :

  1. Allow Nationalcreditreport.com to share limited amounts of your nonpublic personal information, other than credit report information, outside Nationalcreditreport.com
  2. Limit such information sharing outside Nationalcreditreport.com
  3. Limit such information sharing within Nationalcreditreport.com. The process of limiting our ability to share your nonpublic personal information, other than credit report information, is called "opting out"



We provide you three different options to consider, and have a strong commitment to honor your request. They are to:

  1. **Continue receiving valuable and convenient product and service offers**  
No action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable product and service offers by allowing Nationalcreditreport.com to share limited amounts of your nonpublic personal information, other than credit report information, within and outside Nationalcreditreport.com
  2. **Opt out of information sharing outside the Nationalcreditreport.com**  
Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic personal information with our well-respected, carefully screened business partners. This choice may limit our ability to inform you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner companies. Click here to OPT-OUT
  3. **Opt out of information sharing within the Nationalcreditreport.com**  
Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic personal information within the Nationalcreditreport.com. This choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial investment plan, other financial service offers and more. Click here to OPT-OUT



For products and services to multiple consumers, we will treat an opt out by any consumer as applying to all consumers which purchased one of our products or services. Please be aware that even if you decide to opt out, Nationalcreditreport.com will continue to share nonpublic personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf and with third parties as otherwise required or permitted by law as well as share transactions and experience (such as the type of credit-related product you ordered or your payment history with us) within the Nationalcreditreport.com.

In today's ever-changing, competitive market, opting-out may mean missing timely information about money-saving products and services that help you accomplish your financial goals. It's something to think about carefully. We don't want you to miss any opportunities.

_Notice to Vermont Residents: Vermont law requires us to have different practices for sharing information. We will not share non-public personal information with anyone except as follows. We will only share information with companies that perform services on our behalf such as the marketing provider who may send out promotional emails regarding our products and services (if we have such vendor) and with third parties as otherwise required or permitted by law such as a law enforcement agency who requests data upon receipt of the appropriate lawful documentation, a credit reporting agency or regulator._

Benefits of sharing outside Nationalcreditreport.com
