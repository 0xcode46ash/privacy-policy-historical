If you provide your postal address, telephone number, or email address to the National MS Society online, you may receive any of the following periodic contacts from us:

From time to time, the National MS Society makes postal addresses available to other reputable organizations whose products, programs, or activities may be of interest to you. The Society carefully screens all organizations before allowing the use of our list. The list is never sold. 

If you do not want us to share your postal address with other organizations, please submit a statement to your local chapter via mail, or contact us via email at [mailinglist@nmss.org](mailto:mailinglist@nmss.org)
