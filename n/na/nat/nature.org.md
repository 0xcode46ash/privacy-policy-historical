### Privacy Principles

This web site, [http://nature.org/](https://web.archive.org/), is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy. Our intention is to provide an informative tool for those interested in conservation and as a means of allowing our members and the public to become more involved in our mission. We recognize that visitors to our web site may be concerned about the information that they provide to us and how we treat that information. The Nature Conservancy is committed to honoring our constituents' privacy preferences.

To this end, the Conservancy supports the following principles:

**Consumer Choice**  
We believe that a visitor to our web site is the one to best determine:

  * When — and under what conditions — to provide "personally identifiable information" _(e.g.,_ data that may be used to identify, contact, or locate a person)
  * When such information may be shared with other organizations
  * When to remain anonymous



**Informed Consent**  
When personally identifiable information is collected, we believe that a visitor to our web site has the right to:

  * Know when we are collecting personal information
  * Know what personal information is collected, and the purpose of any such collection
  * Expect the opportunity to choose whether or not personal information will be provided to any third parties
  * Expect reasonable steps to be taken to protect personal information from unauthorized use
  * Review the accuracy of personal information and update it



**Charity Navigator,** America's largest charity evaluator, recently ([December, 2004](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/68/cpid/238.htm)) evaluated the written privacy policies of 3,282 charities and non-profits in order to determine the organizations' commitment to protecting the confidentiality of their donors' and members' personal information.

Charity Navigator has reviewed The Nature Conservancy's privacy policy and reported it to be prominently displayed on our web site and electronic marketing/solicitation materials. Additionally, Charity Navigator reported that The Nature Conservancy offers all users **[the opportunity to opt-out](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/misc/art5099.html)** of having their membership information shared with third-party organizations.

### Privacy Policy

Your right to privacy is very important to us. We recognize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a privacy policy to protect your personal information. This policy covers all web sites owned or operated by The Nature Conservancy. We encourage you to take the time to read this privacy policy and our legal disclosure documents as well as those of any web site that you may visit.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to The Nature Conservancy by [asking us a question online](http://help.nature.org/cgi-bin/natureconservancy.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php). Please reference this privacy policy in your subject line.

Following is The Nature Conservancy's online privacy policy.

#### Your Personal Information

**Personal Information Collected  
** In general, when you visit our web sites and access information you remain anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to us to view our web site.

There are occasions when we will ask for additional information. We do this to better understand and respond to your needs, and provide you with services that may be valuable to you. For example, personally identifiable information will be collected in order for you to join The Nature Conservancy’s [Great Places Network](http://support.nature.org/).

**What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information**  
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, e-mail address, format preference (HTML vs. plain text), physical address, interests, and similar information. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as social security numbers.

**Use of Your Personal Information**  
On a selective basis, personally identifiable information is made available to organizations whose postal mailings and products we think you will find of interest. [**You have the right to opt-out**](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/misc/art5099.html) of these mailings and our sharing of your information. Whether or not you choose to share your information will have no impact on any of your interactions with us, either online or off-line. The Nature Conservancy never shares your e-mail address with outside organizations.

[**You may opt-out** by selecting a confidentiality option online](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/misc/art5099.html) or by calling our Member Care Team toll-free at (800) 628-6860 Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., EST. If you elect to keep your record private, we will not provide any of your personal information to other organizations.

**E-Mail Sent to Us Containing Personal Information  
**You may decide to send The Nature Conservancy personally identifying information. For example, you might send the Conservancy an e-mail message containing information about your membership. We will use this information solely to identify you as a member of The Nature Conservancy and to determine how to best respond to the e-mail. We will not use this information for any purpose other than to resolve the specific matter identified in your e-mail.

**Internet Protocol Address**  
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We collect an IP address from all visitors to our web site. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our web site, analyze usage trends, track users' interactions with the web site, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the web site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Invite-A-Friend and e-Cards**  
If a user elects to use our Invite-A-Friend referral service for informing a friend about our web site, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. The Nature Conservancy will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail message inviting them to visit a particular web page on the web site. The Nature Conservancy uses the recipient information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and the recipient information is not retained.

Similarly, if a user sends an e-card to a friend, we ask them for the e-card recipient’s name and e-mail address. Upon completion of the e-card, The Nature Conservancy will automatically send a one-time e-mail to the recipient containing the e-card in HTML format. The Nature Conservancy uses the recipient information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and the recipient information is not retained.

### Security of Your Information

**Security**  
All sensitive information (such as your credit card information) provided to The Nature Conservancy or our trusted partner, Convio, is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our web site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of The Nature Conservancy.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information to the fullest extent, we cannot ensure or completely guarantee the security of such information.

[](http://www.verisign.com/products-services/security-services/ssl/secure-site-seal.html)

**The VeriSign Secured Seal**  
The globally recognized VeriSign Secured Seal _(at right)_ allows you to learn more about the web sites that you visit before you submit any confidential information. The Nature Conservancy’s and Convio’s investment in this advanced technology ensures that the web page you are visiting is authentic, secure, and that any data or information you submit will be protected by 128-bit SSL encryption.

Whenever you see the VeriSign Secured Seal on our web sites, you can personally verify that the web page in question is both secure and administered directly by The Nature Conservancy or Convio. You may submit personally identifiable information and/or sensitive data (such as credit card numbers) to the web site with the assurance that:

  * The web site has a VeriSign Secure Server ID
  * VeriSign has verified the organizational name and that The Nature Conservancy and/or Convio have the proof of right to use it
  * The web site legitimately runs under the auspices of The Nature Conservancy and/or Convio
  * All information sent to the web site, if in an SSL session, is encrypted, protecting against disclosure to third parties

**Your Credit Card Information  
** When you enter your credit card information into a form field on [http://nature.org/](https://web.archive.org/) or <http://support.nature.org/>, your credit card information is encrypted and transmitted securely to The Nature Conservancy or Convio. Neither The Nature Conservancy nor Convio store your credit card information on a permanent basis; your credit card information is only used for the duration of the transaction and is then deleted from our records.

### Cookies

**What are "Cookies"?  
** Cookies are small files sent from a web server to your computer through your browser program. There are two types of cookies: non-persistent and persistent cookies.

A non-persistent cookie enables a web site to temporarily keep information on your computer as you travel from one page to another on our web site. This cookie is automatically deleted from your machine when you close your browser. Because these cookies are necessary to provide some functions, failure to allow such cookies may make some of the functions on our web site unavailable to you.

A persistent cookie is kept even when you close your browser. You can manually delete these cookies using commands specific to your browser and computer system. These cookies store information that would generally not change from session to session. They also contain information that would need to be reentered by you each time you visit the web site. For example, a common use of persistent cookies is to allow a registered web site visitor to enter the web site without having to specify their username and password.

**Our Use of Cookies**  
The Nature Conservancy and Convio use cookies for various reasons. The Nature Conservancy and Convio only read information from the specific cookies that are written by our web sites. The Nature Conservancy and Convio do not use cookies to obtain information about other web sites that you may have visited. Cookies may be used to store some history about the parts of our web sites that you have visited to help you navigate our web sites more easily or to alert you to related pages on our web site that may interest you.

Learn more about [cookies](http://www.cookiecentral.com/c_concept.htm).

### Our Compliance with Federal Law

**Children's Guidelines**  
The Nature Conservancy complies fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).

None of the web sites covered by this policy knowingly collect identifiable personal information from children under age 13. If we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems. We are unable to reply to information requests from children under the age of 13, if so identified. A parent or guardian must initiate any requests for information from children under the age of 13 on their behalf. We encourage parents to supervise children when they browse the Internet.

  * **Always** offers recipients of e-mail marketing and e-newsletters a clear means of opting-out from the receipt of future messages
  * **Always** includes the Conservancy’s physical address within the body of all our e-mail messages:
