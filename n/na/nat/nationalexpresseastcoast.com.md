## Use of “cookies” and internet tags

We may collect and process anonymous information about your visit to this website, such as some of the pages you visit and some of the searches you perform. Such anonymous information is used by us to help improve the contents of the site and to compile, for internal market research purposes, aggregate statistics about individuals using it. In doing this we may install “cookies” that collect the first-level domain name of the user (e.g. “bigmail.com” from an e-mail address of “john@bigmail.com”) and the date and time of access. “Cookies” as used by us cannot be used to discover the identity of an individual user.

A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. “Cookies” do not damage your computer and you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a “cookie”, which in turn will enable you to decide whether or not you want to accept it or not. For further information about “cookies”, please visit [**www.allaboutcookies.org**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We may also on occasion use Internet tags in combination with “cookies” at this site and may deploy these tags through a third-party advertising partner. These tags are placed on both on-line advertisements that bring users to the site and on different pages of the site. We use this technology to measure visitor response to our sites and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns (including how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted). The third-party may be able to collect anonymous aggregated data about visitors to other sites because of these Internet tags and “cookies”.

Please be assured that we DO NOT collect or seek through these tags or “cookies” any personally identifiable information about our visitors, such as names, addresses, email addresses or telephone numbers.

  


## Our Pledge to You

We pledge our intention to meet our obligations under this Privacy Policy statement, and to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998.
