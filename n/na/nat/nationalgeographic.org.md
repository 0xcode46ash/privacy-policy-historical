# Privacy Policy - National Geographic Society

###### Your Privacy Rights

**Scope of the Privacy Policy**

The National Geographic Society, which also is known as nationalgeographic.org (collectively, “National Geographic Society,” “we” or “our”) understand the importance of our your privacy. This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect about you when you visit this website or use an online application that contains a link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). Our Privacy Policy also tells you how we use, share and protect this information; what choices you have about how this information is used; and how you can access and update this information. Certain aspects of this Privacy Policy also apply to the personally identifiable information we collect offline.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies and can be used to contact a particular individual, such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number. When other information, such as email newsletter choices, magazine or product purchases, or consumer product preferences, is associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information. 

###### Information Collected

**Information You Provide Directly to National Geographic Society**

If you are interested in obtaining information, products or services from National Geographic Society, or in participating in certain activities on the Services, you may need to provide us with information about yourself. For example: 

  * If you order a product from us, we ask for your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and your credit card number. 
  * If you are ordering a product as a gift for another person, we will ask you for that person’s name, postal address and phone number in order to enable us to deliver the gift to the recipient. 
  * If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, we may also ask you to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information that we have obtained about you. 



In addition, we may combine personally identifiable information that you have provided to us with other information that is publicly available or that we receive from other sources. 

**Information We Collect Automatically  **

In addition to information you choose to provide to us, we also use standard Internet technologies to collect automatically certain additional information. For example: 

  * IP Address or Device Identifier. When you come to our Services, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which identifies the computer or service provider that you use to access the Services or your mobile device identifier, if you connect through a mobile device. We may use these identifiers to collect information regarding the frequency with which specific visitors visit various parts of our Services. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information that we have collected to make our Services and our communications to you more targeted to your interests. 
  * Cookies. Our site also uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users. We use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to enhance the quality of our Site. We use transient (also called “session ID”) cookies to provide continuity from page to page. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies. Persistent cookies allow our online store and certain other parts of our Site to recognize your browser when you return after your first visit to that part of our Site. Cookies allow us to personalize your return visits to our Site and to save you time during certain activities, such as checking out from our online store. You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us to send you cookies. However, if you do not accept cookies from us, your ability to use some areas of our Site will be limited, such as our shopping cart feature or online games.
  * Web beacons and other technologies. The Services uses other tracking tools, including web beacons. Web beacons are images on the Services (or in emails that the Services sends to you) that help us determine what parts of the Services you have visited, whether you have opened an email that we have sent to you, or otherwise to measure the effectiveness of the Services. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information directly to us or to a service provider authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. [For more information about how we use a third party service to collect and use information on this Site](http://www.nielsen-online.com/privacy.jsp?section=leg_scs).



The information we collect automatically may be combined with information that is personally identifiable so that we can make our Site and communications more interesting to you.

###### Information Use

National Geographic Society may use information that we collect about you for a variety of business purposes, including:

  * to communicate with you about the Services or other products or services in which you may be interested, or to respond to your inquiries or comments;

  * within the National Geographic Society family, which is defined for this purpose as corporate affiliates of National Geographic Society (“Affiliates”) and entities that are authorized to use the “National Geographic” name and registered trademarks to brand their products or services (such as National Geographic Partners, LLC and its sub-licensees);
  * with identified entities whose products or services you specifically use or request to receive while you use the Services;
  * with other selected third parties so that they may send you promotional materials about goods and services that they offer, but you have the opportunity to opt out of our sharing personally identifiable information about you as described below in the section entitled “Your Choices,” and we will not share your email address with third parties for promotional purposes unless you specifically agree to such sharing;
  * when we believe that doing so is required by law, may be necessary to protect any person’s property, rights, or safety, or to investigate a potential violation of law, will help to enforce any terms of use or other legal agreement, or will help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, or in the event of a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale;
  * in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form; or
  * in accordance with your consent.

###### Third Party Sites

If you click on or interact with a hyperlink that you find on the Services, including but not limited to nationalgeographic.com, you may leave our Services or send information to a different website or application.

Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the credit card information sent between your computer and our database. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy. 

###### Personally Identifiable Information Contained in User Content

Some parts of our Services may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials. If you choose to make personally identifiable information public through these Services, National Geographic Society will consider that information public and will not limit its disclosure in the manner described here.
