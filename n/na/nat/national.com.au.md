### Information from a credit reporting body

When we’re checking your creditworthiness and at other times, we might collect information about you from and give it to credit reporting bodies. This information can include:

**ID information** : a record of your name(s) (including an alias or previous name), date of birth, gender, current or last known address and previous two addresses, name of current or last known employer and driver's licence number.

**Information request** : a record of a lender asking a credit reporting body for information in relation to a credit application, including the type and amount of credit applied for.

**Default information** : a record of your consumer credit1 payments being overdue.

**Serious credit infringement** : a record of when a lender reasonably believes that there has been a fraud relating to your consumer credit or that you have avoided paying your consumer credit payments and the credit provider can’t find you.

**Personal insolvency information:** a record relating to **** your bankruptcy or your entry into a debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement.

**Court proceedings information:** an Australian court judgment relating to your credit.

**Publicly available information:** a record relating to your activities in Australia and your creditworthiness.

**Consumer credit liability information** : certain details relating to your consumer credit, such as the name of the credit provider, whether the credit provider has an Australian Credit Licence, the type of consumer credit, the day on which the consumer credit was entered into and terminated, the maximum amount of credit available and certain repayment terms and conditions.

**Repayment history information:** a record of whether or not you’ve made monthly consumer credit payments and when they were paid.2

**Payment information:** if a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and the overdue amount is paid, a statement that the payment has been made.

**New arrangement information:** if a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and your consumer credit contract is varied or replaced, a statement about this.

We base some things on the information we get from credit reporting bodies such as:

  * our summaries of what the credit reporting bodies tell us, and
  * credit scores. A credit score is a calculation that lets us know how likely a credit applicant will repay credit we may make available to them.



Information that we get from a credit reporting body, or information we derive from such information is known as **credit eligibility information**.

### What sensitive information do we collect?

Sometimes we need to collect sensitive information3 about you, for instance in relation to some insurance applications. This could include things like medical checks, medical consultation reports or other information about your health. Unless required by law, we will only collect sensitive information with your consent.
