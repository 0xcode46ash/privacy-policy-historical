Protected Health Information, hereafter noted as "PHI" or "your PHI", is information about you or a patient for whom you are responsible, including demographic or billing information, that may individually identify you or the patient, and that relates to past, present, or future health conditions and related health care services and payment.

This serves as notice of our intent to maintain all medical records and information in the strictest of confidence.  
  
_HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PHI_

_FOR TREATMENT._ Â We will use PHI to provide, coordinate or manage health care and any related services. This includes communication with other physicians, nurses, technicians, office staff, or providers of services (specialists, laboratories, orthotists, prosthetists, facilities, pharmacies, etc.) who provide care or services requested by your physician. For example, your doctor or nurse or social worker may provide medical information to your other doctors or health care providers to coordinate your care.

_FOR PAYMENT._ We will use PHI to obtain payment for services you receive from ICHA, or another provider who has treated you, from an insurance company or a third party. This may include pre-treatment reviews or authorizations, determinations of eligibility and coverage, reviewing services provided to you for medical necessity, and undertaking utilization review activities. For example, we may contact your insurance company before an office or home visit, or surgery, or testing, to determine the need for precertification or to determine whether your plan will cover the services.

_BUSINESS OPERATIONS._ We may use or disclose PHI in order to support our business activities. These include, but are not limited to, professional peer review, employee review activities, clinical improvement, training or education of students or residents, continuation of medical education, accrediting, insurance and licensing activities, and conducting or arranging for other business activities. For example, we may use your PHI to train medical residents or students who see our patients. We may also disclose your PHI to another health care facility, professional or plan for such purposes as quality assurance if that entity has a healthcare relationship with you.

_APPOINTMENTS AND SERVICES._ We may contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care at the office. We may also contact you with test results. You have the right to request and we will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests by you to receive communications regarding your PHI from us by alternative means or at alternative locations (see "Your Rights").

_BUSINESS ASSOCIATES._ We will share your PHI with third party 'business associates' who perform various activities (e.g., billing, transcription) for us. Whenever an arrangement with a business associate involves the use or disclosure of PHI, we will have a written contract that contains terms that will protect the privacy of this PHI.

_OTHERS INVOLVED IN YOUR HEALTHCARE._ Unless you request otherwise, we may disclose, to a member of your or the patient's family, relative, or close friend or any other person you identify, PHI that directly relates to that person's involvement in the patient's health care. If you are unable to agree or object to such a disclosure, we may disclose such information as necessary if we determine that is in the patient's best interest based on our professional judgement. We may use or disclose PHI to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, or any other person that is responsible for the patient of the patient's location, and general condition.

_COMMUNICATION BARRIERS:_ We may use and disclose your PHI if we or your physician or another physician attempts to obtain consent from you but is unable to do so due to substantial communication barriers and the physician determines, using professional judgement, that you intend to consent to use or disclose under the circumstances.

_EMERGENCIES._ **_Your consent is not required before using or disclosing PHI in an emergency treatment situation._** We will attempt to obtain consent, but will proceed with treatment and use and disclosure of PHI as needed. If this happens, we or your physician will try to obtain your consent as soon as reasonably possible.

_GOODS AND SERVICES:_ Unless you object, we may use and disclose your PHI to provide you with information about treatment alternatives or other health related benefits and services we offer. For example, your name and address may be used to send you a newsletter about a product or service that may be beneficial to you.

_REVOKING CONSENT:_ You may revoke your Consent at any time by giving us written notice. Your revocation will be effective when we receive it, but it will not apply to any uses and disclosures that occurred before that time. If you do revoke your Consent, we will not be permitted to use or disclose information for purposes of treatment, payment or healthcare operations, and we may therefore choose to discontinue providing you with healthcare treatment and services.

Other uses and disclosures of PHI will be made only with your written Authorization, unless otherwise permitted or required by law as described below. You may revoke an Authorization at any time, in writing.

_FACILITY DIRECTORY AND FUNDRAISING:_ If you receive care from a Children's Hospital entity, and unless you object, we may disclose the patient's name in our inpatient facility directory (name, room, general condition and religious affiliation). Also, unless you object, we may contact you to contribute to a fundraising effort for or on our behalf, and you may be contacted by someone in the future either during or after your care to inquire about your interest in:

  * having your story used for fundraising, newsletter articles, fundraising videos, direct mail, and other marketing related efforts; 
  * visiting with a celebrity or athlete during the patient's stay; 
  * participating in events, such as press conferences, symphony concerts, and other events both inside and outside our facilities. 



You and the patient will always have the option not to participate in the activities above, and may formally opt out at inpatient admission or by writing to Children's Hospital Foundation, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205 with a statement that you do not wish to participate.

Your physician is not required to agree to a restriction that you may request.

_You have the right to request to receive confidential communications from us by alternative means or at an alternative location._ You have the right to request that we communicate with you about medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location.

We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request.
