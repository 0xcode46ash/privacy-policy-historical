This Privacy Statement describes how we treat the information we collect when you register for and view emails from us or visit our Web Site. Please read this notice carefully. By using EHM’s websites, you agree to our privacy practices outlined here.

**Personal Information**

To receive e-mails from us, we require your e-mail address. We may also request your name, telephone number and other personal information, including credit card and payment information. EHM does not collect any information that identifies you or is identifiable to you (Personal Information) that you do not knowingly provide. EHM may use your Personal Information to provide and market products and services from us and third parties to you, to display content and advertising that are customized to you and otherwise operate our Web Site. EHM may share your Personal Information with service providers for the purpose of operating our Web Site and delivering our e-mails or other products or services to you. Each of these service providers is subject to obligations to keep your data confidential and use it only for the purpose for which we provide it to them. EHM is not responsible for any further use or disclosure of your Personal Data by service providers. We may also share your Personal Information with others as required by law or as necessary to protect the interests of EHM or related parties.

**Public Forums and Activities**

Any information you disclose in public forums or otherwise disclose to third parties through our Web Site, including any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by us for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you chose to engage in our forums or other public activities, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages or for other unintended purposes. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your submissions or public activities.

**Aggregate and Demographic Information**

In addition to collecting Personal Information, EHM or others acting on our behalf may also collect survey and other demographic data that is not Personal Information. We may also collect and develop aggregate information about our subscribers’ and their use of our emails and Web Site. This information will only be used to find out more about our subscriber base (but not in a manner that could identify you or be identified to you) and how subscribers use our emails, Web Site and products and services. For example, this information will tell us how often users open emails from us, how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. It also allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and efficiently deliver your emails.

**Review and Access**

Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.

**How to Unsubscribe**

You can unsubscribe from receiving EHM emails at any time. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the footer of any EHM email or on the bottom of the EHM homepage and following the instructions. If for any reason you want to leave us and have trouble doing so please email [info@EHM.com](mailto:info@EHM.com).

**Choice/Opt-Out**

If we ever send you information by email concerning new products or services from us or third parties that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address or other mechanism by which you may reject receipt of similar future notices.

**Third Party Advertising**

Some of the ads appearing on our emails and Web Site may be delivered to you by our advertising partner or partners. Information about your visit to a partner site or sites, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to provide ads to you.

Occasionally, you’ll get emails, alerts or other mailings, which include advertisements or offers from or information about third parties. EHM does not endorse any products or services available from such third parties. Materials from those third parties, regardless of their relationship with us, are provided merely for information purposes and users should make their own judgments and evaluation of any services or products available on any other web sites. You can unsubscribe from receipt of this content. Please see “How to Unsubscribe.”

Like most sites, EHM makes use of browser “cookies.” Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard disk. They allow us to quickly recognize you and simplify your user experience. EHM will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that is unrelated to our site or services. In the course of providing advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. EHM also uses transparent GIF images to track the emails that we send.

**Links to Other Sites**

We may provide links allowing you to access third party sites. EHM is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse them.

**No Use by Children under Age of 13**

We do not collect or maintain information on our Web Site from those we actually know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our Web Site targeted to attract anyone under 13.

**Export of Personal Information**

Personal Information provided by you is stored and processed in the United States and possibly other countries, which may not afford the same level of protection of your data as laws of the country in which you are located.
