**PRIVACY POLICY AND STATEMENT OF  
WWW.NATIVELY.COM  
and all related sites owned, operated or controlled by Natively**  
  
---  
Â  **Information Collection and Use**  
Natively is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Natively will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Natively collects information from our users at several different points in the Natively website, services and products. 

**Information Collected**  
Natively requests information from the user on order form, request for download or information, newsletters, product registration and other locations. Here a user may provide contact information (like name and address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If Natively has trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Natively uses cookies to gather and store information. Cookies are pieces of data that a web site transfers to the user computer's hard drive solely for record-keeping purposes. Cookies help Natively make its software more useful by storing information on your preferences. There is nothing unusual about the use of cookies by a website and they are an industry standard. Your browser is most likely set up to accept cookies, but you can set yours to refuse them. If you do so, you may not be able to take full advantage of Natively 's website. 

**Log Files**  
Natively uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information with the exception of fraud prevention. 

**Sharing**  
Natively shares aggregated demographic information with partners. Natively uses an outside shipping company and a credit card processing company to bill users for services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Natively partners with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, Natively will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

**Links**  
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Natively is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Natively encourages users to be aware when they leave this site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time to time, the Natively site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Information collected may be used to contact you and offer Natively and third party services and products.

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use Natively's referral service for informing a friend about this site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Natively will automatically send the friend emails inviting him or her to visit the site. The friend may contact Natively to request the removal of the information from the database. 

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and offline. When registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as the payment reply form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. 

**Special Offers**  
Natively sends all new clients and prospects an email to verify the email address. Established members will occasionally receive information on services, special deals, and newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, Natively presents the option to not receive this type of communication. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Natively users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to Natively site.
