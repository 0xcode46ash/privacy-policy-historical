They enable NATIVE INSTRUMENTS’ systems to recognize your browser and offer you different services. No security relevant or personal data will be stored. Furthermore, cookies cannot transmit viruses, spy out data on your computer or send e-mails without your notice. Also, every web server can only read cookies it has set itself. 

Using our web site without cookies being set is possible under certain conditions; a purchase in the shop unfortunately does not work without the possibility of setting cookies. 

The most browsers are set by default to accept cookies automatically. But you can disable cookies being storing or configure your browser in a way that it notifies you before storing cookies. As you can only make full use of the most of our interesting features with cookies being enabled, we recommend leaving the cookie function on.

This particularly applies to computers in public spaces, such as internet cafés or libraries. In this case we highly recommend completely signing off so that no data remain recognizable for the next user. 

The careful handling of your personal information is important to us. It is by no ways our business to sell this information. We hand over information that we receive to third parties solely for the purposes described in the following: 

**1.** In some cases NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is required by law to disclose information to third parties. In particular when a crime or abuse is suspected, NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is obliged to disclose information to law enforcement authorities. This includes exchanging information with companies that inquire credit card abuse. No personal data is passed if companies want to use them commercially. 

**2.** We assign other service providers, partner companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include payment processing (credit card, direct debit), analysis of our databases, handling newsletters and other promotional activities as well as analysis and documentation of our site visits (see chapter 7.a Google Analytics, 7.b „interest-based advertising and 7.c Facebook). 

These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their tasks. However, the may not use them for any other purposes. They are also obliged to treat the information in accordance with this privacy policy and the German data protection laws. For this reason, we try to assign service providers who are bound to the German data protection regulations, or at least to the European data protection rules. 

As part of a credit card and credit assessment your name and your address are passed to such a company, whereas your rights are respected in strict accordance with statutory provisions. In charge of this: Acceptance Lufthansa Airplus GmbH, Odenwaldstrasse 19, 63263 Neu Isenburg. 

**3.** As we continuously develop our business, it may occur that we sell or buy individual subsidiaries, business units or parts of them. In such transactions, customer information is usually transferred together with the transferred part of the company. Your data are further subject to the previously existing privacy statement. The only exception is the case that you explicitly agree to other provisions. In the unlikely event that all or substantial parts of NATIVE INSTRUMENTS are sold, personal information will be passed on to the buyer. 

**4.** In all other cases, we will inform you when personal information should be disclosed to third parties, and give you the opportunity to give your consent. 

In the context of Chapter 6. we want to specially point out Google Analytics. NATIVE INSTRUMENTS uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. This service uses cookies to help analyze how the site is used. 

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. 

Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for NATIVE INSTRUMENTS and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. 

As Google Inc. is based in the United States, it is not subject to the German and European data protection laws. For technical reasons, the use of NI’s website without Google Analytics is currently not possible. NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is seeking to recruit an alternative provider for this service in the future. 

Within the scope of its marketing operations NATIVE INSTRUMENTS uses Google’s program for “interest-based advertising”, so-called remarketing. In the process of this program a special browser cookie is stored on the user’s computer. It is used for serving the user special ads by Native Instruments, Google or third-party services when visiting other websites.

By integrating of the plug-in, Facebook receives the information that you have visited our website. As long as you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to the site to your facebook account. The plug-in transmits any actions you perform via the plug-in, e.g. pressing the “Like”-Button, directly on to Facebook, and these data will be stored there.

To prevent such a collection of data through Facebook, you must log out on Facebook before visiting our website. 

**1.** We have developed organizational and technical measures to reliably protect the data received from you. Our employees are intensively informed and trained and commit themselves to the data confidentiality. This ensures that your data are kept confidential. We can particularly ensure that your data is protected because we provide our customer service through our own staff and not by third parties. Thereby controls and effective training are possible. 

**2.** To protect your personal data during transmission to our servers, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. This encrypts all information you transmit to us. 

**3.** When confirming an order, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card number. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate companies while processing the order. 

**4.** Furthermore, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Part of these security measures is that we occasionally may ask you to provide proof of your identity before we disclose personal information. 

**5.** We would like to point out that it is important to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share your computer with others (notably for computers in public areas such as Internet cafés and libraries), you should make sure to logout after each session.
