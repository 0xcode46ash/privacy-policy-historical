# Cookies & Privacy Policy - Introduction | Nationwide

##  Introduction

We collect personal information about you when you apply for products or carry out transactions with us on our websites. If you use our secure services we'll ask you to provide some information about yourself for security, identification and verification purposes. When completing any online forms, we'll tell you how your information will be used in relation to the product or service you are applying for within the form.

We will only collect information that is relevant to providing our online services. We will keep your information as long as permitted for our legitimate business purposes and for any retention period that we are legally required to meet. We may sometimes need to transfer your information to third parties who provide services to us, on the understanding that they keep the information confidential and use it only for our agreed purposes.

When you use our secure services, all information, including messages, are protected by encryption while in transit across the Internet. If you use standard email for communications with Nationwide, information will not be protected in the same way and you should be aware that we cannot guarantee that it remains confidential whilst in transit. All email sent to Nationwide will be monitored and checked to ensure our systems operate effectively.
