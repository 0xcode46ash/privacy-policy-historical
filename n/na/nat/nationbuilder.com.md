# 3dna Privacy Policy

We at 3dna know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.

By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. Remember that your use of 3dna's Services is at all times subject to our Master Terms of Service located at [www.nationbuilder.com/tos](http://www.nationbuilder.com/tos "3dna Terms of Service") (the "Master Terms"), which incorporate these Additional Terms. Any terms we use in these Additional Terms without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Master Terms.

**What does this Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don't own or control, or people that we don't manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to provide and improve the Services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

Please note that some of our Services (e.g., NationBuilder) may allow you to provide us with Personal Information regarding your own users, visitors, supporters or voters ("Third Party Personal Information"). This Privacy Policy deals with our use of your own Personal Information, and not Third Party Personal Information that you may provide to us in connection with the Services.

We are not responsible for the practices of sites linked to from the Services, or for the privacy practices of nations that are run by our other customers on the Services, and before interacting with any of these sites or nations you are advised to review their rules and policies before providing them with any private information.

As noted in the Master Terms, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for our Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. Please reach us at [privacy@nationbuilder.com](mailto:privacy@nationbuilder.com) with any concerns.

**Will 3dna ever change this Privacy Policy?**

We're constantly working to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

**Information We Collect**

When you sign up for the Services, you provide us with information such as your name and email address. We may also collect information from your public social media accounts.

When you use the Services, we may send cookies - small text files containing alphanumeric characters - to your computer to identify your browser and help enhance your experience with the Services. You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features of the Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our emails.

Our servers automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Services. These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Service you visited, your internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Services. These log files are generally deleted after one week.

3dna uses [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html "Google Analytics Privacy")Â and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/privacy/ "Mixpanel privacy policy") to help us understand use of our Services.

Financial information connected to payments may be collected or stored by a third-party payment processor and is subject to their terms and policies.

**How We Use Your Information**

We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. 3dna may use certain information about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.

By providing NationBuilder your email address (including by "following," "liking," linking your account to the NationBuilder service, etc., on a third party website or network), you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out on the [NationBuilder.com unsubscribe page](http://nationbuilder.com/unsubscribe "Unsubscribe to NationBuilder.com emails"). Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

Following termination or deactivation of your account, 3dna may retain your profile information and all information posted to public areas of the Service.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track user Content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

**How We Share Your Information**

**Personally Identifiable Information:** 3dna will never rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. 3dna may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of 3dna (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy or website customization settings. To change your privacy settings on the Service, you may visit [your NationBuilder account settings page](https://web.archive.org/web/20141130164006id_/http%3A//nationbuilder.com/%7B%7B%20request.current_signup.settings_url%20%7D%7D). If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, 3dna will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of NationBuilder, our users or others.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain NationBuilder services.

**Security**

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

**What You Can Access**

Through [your account settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20141130164006id_/http%3A//nationbuilder.com/%7B%7B%20request.current_signup.settings_url%20%7D%7D), you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information youâve provided to us:

  * name and password

The information that you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at [privacy@nationbuilder.com](mailto:privacy@nationbuilder.com).

Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: [privacy@nationbuilder.com](mailto:privacy@nationbuilder.com).

**Choices Regarding your Personal Information**

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

Why can we not opt out of this. In truth its actually Blackmailing you to get your information. Depending on good honest people to want to do the right thing. I hate it. If there was another way to sign the petitions I would. For years I didnât and this is only my second because of the bs that is required.
