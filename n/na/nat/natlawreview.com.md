# The National Law Review's Privacy Policy | The National Law Review

Welcome to the National Law Review (“NLR”). NLR provides various services and products (collective, the “Services”) to visitors using its Webs site. Visitors include all users of the website (the “User(s)”), including users registering with NLR (the “Registered User(s)”). NLR may collect certain information during a User. The information may be voluntarily provided by the User or automatically recognized by NLR’s server. NLR cares about our Users’ information and is committed to the privacy and security of all its Users and Registered Users. This Privacy Policy explains the type of information that NLR may collect and the treatment of such information.

  This Privacy Policy only applies to the NLR Services and not to the practices of companies that NLR does not own or control, or to individuals that NLR does not employ or manage, including operators of Web sites Users may visit before, during or after visiting the NLR Web site, and the owners or publishers of the documents, advertisements or postings and other products (collectively, the “Publications”) Users download, review, or otherwise access through the NLR’s Service. NLR recommends you view the privacy policy statements of companies, individuals or organization that may interface with NLR in order to understand how they may collect, use and share your information.

  **A. Information We Collect**

  The NLR Web site collects and stores two types of information: 1) information voluntarily provided by Users and Registered Users, and 2) information which is automatically recognized by NLR’s Web server and stored whenever a User visits the NLR Web site.

  _1) Voluntary Information_

  a. Registration Data: NLR does not require registration to view content on our website. If User wants to post documents, receive email updates, advertise, post a blog answer or reply, or participate in other activities, NLR may require certain limited information in order to process User’s request. When User registers for the NLR Service and becomes a Registered User, User may be asked to provide basic contact information such as User’s name, company or organization name, address, phone, professional title, and email address (collective, “Personal Information”). We use Personal Information to respond to User’s inquiries, post information provided by User and to send User information as may be requested from time to time.

  b. Order Data: When a Registered User posts documents or places advertisements on the NLR Web site, NLR collects various information including Registered User’s address and billing information, and, possibly, bank account information or credit card number and expiration date for payment purpose. Additionally, we request the author’s name, organization’s name (if any), contact information and a brief biography of the author to be included with any document posted. Also, NLR may collect a Registered User’s photo(s) or firm logo, if such user chooses to incorporate this material with any posted information; this information will be retained in the Registered User’s profile for the Registered User’s future use in the posting of a specified article if the Registered User chooses.

  c. Other Information: We may collect additional information at other times, including but not limited to, when User provides feedback, changes content or email preferences, respond to a survey, or communicates with NLR Customer Support. Additionally, User may voluntarily provide your address and other additional information in order to be included on NLR email list. Furthermore, if User elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or forward a document, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. NLR stores this information and may contact the friend to invite him or her to visit the NLR Web site. The friend may contact NLR to request the removal of this information from our database.

  _2) Automatically Recognized Information_

  a. Computer Configuration: NLR automatically receives and logs information from User’s browser, including IP address, computer's name, operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, and connection speed.

  b. Referral, Click stream, Site Interaction Data: NLR may also record the URL User linked from to get to NLR’s Web site, click stream through and from our Web site, and other generally accepted tracking information.

  c. Email and Delivery Open Rates: To help NLR make our emails more useful and interesting, and to ensure that we are delivering items to User, we often receive a confirmation when User receives and/or open emails from NLR.

  d. File Downloads and Publication Access: When Users view and /or download Publications or other files from NLR or forward or print Publications, we may record when each file transfer begins and ends, any errors that interrupt the transfer, and whether User downloaded, forwarded or accessed a given Publication.

  e. Updated Delivery and Address Information: We may obtain updated contact information from third parties in order to correct our records and fulfill your orders or deliver communications to User.

  f. Cookies: Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that a Web site can store on a user’s computer hard drive. When User visits NLR, and / or creates a Registered User account, downloads or purchases a product and or service from us, we may set cookies on User’s personal computer. We require that cookies be enabled in User’s Web browser so that NLR can identify User as a repeat visitor or customer and maintain session information for Registered Users who are logged in; some of NLR’s services may not operate correctly unless User enables User’s browser to accept cookies. NLR uses cookies to track usage trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of NLR’s Web site. NLR may allow other companies that are providing content on its site to set and access their own cookies on User’s computer. Other companies' use of cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies.

**B. Children**

  The NLR Web site and Services are made available to the general public. However, NLR Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we require that users be 13 years old or older. NLR markets to and collects information from Users and Registered Users as stated herein, but we do not do so intentionally or knowingly with respect to children under the age of 13. If NLR determines that a User or Registered User has provided us with information and that such user is under the age of 13, NLR will delete this information as soon as possible once it is discovered. Anyone using the NLR Web site hereby represents that such user is 13 years old or older.

**D. How We Share the Information We Collect**

  We may share collected information as follows:

  a. Publishers and Partners: NLR may provide its publishers and other merchants (advertisers) anonymous information collected automatically such as information about the pages that Users are viewing, and may include IP addresses and other non-personally identifiable User data and browser types from Users of the NLR Service. In such instances, Registered User’s Personal Information is governed by their privacy policies of such agents.

In such instances, Registered User’s Personal Information is governed by their privacy policies of such agents.

Protection of NLR and Others: NLR at its sole discretion, and without prior permission from anyone, will disclose any information, including and not limited to account information and Personal Information, it deems necessary to comply with any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of NLR, our Users, or others.

Business Transfers: NLR may transfer, sell or assign information it collects, including any Personal Information, in connection with a business combination transaction, consolidation, liquidation or sale or transfer of substantial assets of the NLR.

** **  
**E. Security**

  This website takes reasonable security precautions to protect User and Registered Users’ information. Order Data information will be stored in a database located behind firewalls and accessible only to authorized personnel. NLR does not encrypt normal Web sessions, but any transmission of credit card or other Order Data to our servers uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information provided by User. Password and credit card information is then stored in NLR’s database in an encrypted, non-human readable form. Please note, that no method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, and we, therefore, cannot guarantee the security of User and Registered information. Unauthorized entry or use of the NLR Service, hardware, software or transmissions failure and other factors may compromise the security of User information. If you have reason to believe your interaction with the NLR Service is no longer secure, User must notify NLR immediately. Likewise, if NLR suspects that the security of User information in our possession and control may have been compromised, NLR may seek to notify User of the situation as promptly and as practicable as possible under the circumstances. If you have any questions about the security at our website, or need to contact us if you suspect a breach in the security, you can send an email to [info@natlawreview.com](mailto:info@natlawreview.com).

**F. Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

  If a Registered User’s Personal Information changes, or if a Registered User no longer desires our service, such Registered User is required to update NLR. This can usually be done at the “Your Profile” page or by sending an email to [info@natlawreview.com](mailto:info@natlawreview.com).
