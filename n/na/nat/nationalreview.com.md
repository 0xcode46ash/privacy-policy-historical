**The Benefits of Targeted Advertising**

  
Effective advertising and direct marketing has two goals: (1) to accurately and understand the audience, and (2) to present content that is relevant to users. The collection of online consumer data leads to effective advertising through improved ad targeting. With proper targeting, advertisers will be able to reach and understand the audience and online users will not receive repetitive or irrelevant content.

Effective online targeting causes advertisers to spend more advertising dollars online because advertisers can more easily reach the right at the right time. In turn, more ad dollars spent online leads to FREE consumer audience and subsidized Internet services for consumers. In essence, content providers rely on advertising dollars to fund content. Online advertising and direct marketing fuels the FREE Internet.

 **24/7 Media's Commitment to Privacy**  
24/7 Media recognizes that continuing respect for Internet users' privacy is of the utmost importance in ensuring that advertisers will find the Internet an effective vehicle to reach consumers. 24/7 Media is deeply committed to protecting privacy and fostering consumer confidence. We honor Internet users' privacy rights by giving our consumers Notice, Choice, Access, and ____Security__ __ regarding the collection and use of information about them. 24/7 Media provides this Privacy Policy to make clear to consumers what we do and how we do it.

  
In order to foster consumer confidence, we disclose our privacy practices on this Web site [_www.247media.com._](http://www.247media.com/) Further, we provide all users the opportunity to contact us at [_**privacy@247media.com**_ ](mailto:privacy@247media.com)with any questions or concerns.

**Collection of Data From This Web Site**  
24/7 Media collects very limited information from  
users visiting 24/7 Media's web site located at [_**www.247media.com.**_](http://www.247media.com/) The information collected from such users includes only personally identifiable information about users that inquire about 24/7 Media's services, solutions and business. Collected information may include name, address, e-mail address, telephone number. This web site does not use cookies to collect any personal or Anonymous data (such as IP addresses). We do not store any of such collected data in our database used for delivering targeted advertising and marketing or anonymou **s messages. The information collected at[ _www.247media.com_](http://www.247media.com/)** is used by 24/7 Media solely to respond to the inquiring user and to deliver to such user the relevant information requested. 24/7 Media may respond to users as follows: via an e-mail message if an e-mail address is provided by the user, via postal mail if an address of such user is provided, or via a telephone call if the telephone number of such user is provided. After a user has received a response from 24/7 Media, we destroy the personal information collected about each user or we store the data in our system for follow up with the individual or for internal record keeping purposes.  Therefore, there is no mechanism for users to correct or update any information about themselves.

During the time that the data is housed b _y 24/7 Media, the security measures described under_

 _Security_ __ are in place to safeguard such collected data. The information collected is not shared with or distributed to any third parties. Any material change to this aspect of 24/7 Media's privacy policy will be conspicuously noted both in 24/7 Media's privacy policy and on the home page to our Web site at [_www.247media.com_](http://www.247media.com/) _ _.__  


**NOTICE**

What Information is Collected by 24/7 Media, Inc. — Through its various business divisions, 24/7 Media collects two types of information:  


  * personally identifiable information ("PII"), and
  * anonymous, non-personally identifiable information ("Anonymous Data").  




**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").**  
Personally identifiable information is collected by 24/7 Media when a user voluntarily provides such information to 24/7 Media or a third party partner of 24/7 Media. PII is personal information linked to an individual, such as name, address, phone number or e-mail address. PII also includes other personal information such as birth-date, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information when such information is linked to an individual's identity. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it.

24/7 Media collects PII when users respond to an advertisement or survey, register for an e-mail newsletter, register for a product or service, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by 24/7 Media, its subsidiaries or its partners. In addition, selected third-party partners of 24/7 Media will share personal information with 24/7 Media about their consumers that have consented to the sharing of their personal information with third parties.

24/7 Media does not collect sensitive personal medical information, personal information regarding sexual orientation or behavior, personal credit information, or personal information related to children under the age of 13 without proper parental consent.

**  
Anonymous Data**  
In the course of delivering an online advertisement over the Web to a user, 24/7 Media collects Anonymous Data. Such data is defined as data linked to a particular browser, but not to an individual user.  Anonymous Data is collected by 24/7 Media, through 

_cookies,_ as a user's browser moves among the different Web sites that 24/7 Media services. As 24/7 Media delivers an advertisement or promotion, the 24/7 Connect ad server, through a _cookie,_ automatically recognizes Anonymous Data. 24/7 Media uses cookies to collect Anonymous Data and compile anonymous profiles of online behavior. 24/7 Media will not use these cookies to personally identify an online user in any way without the user's consent to link such Anonymous Data to that user's PII. The types of Anonymous Data collected by 24/7 Media include:

  * Type of Internet browser an online user is using,
  * The name of the URL of web sites visited by a user's browser (stored only in a log file, and not transferred into our targeting database),
  * Type of computer operating system being used,
  * Domain type (.com, .net, or .edu) from which the user accessed a particular web site,
  * Domain name of the Web site from which the user linked to a particular web site,
  * Keywords used to conduct a search on the Web,
  * Type/category of Web sites visited (i.e., sports, women, auto, financial),
  * IP address of Web sites visited (stored only in a log file, and not transferred into our targeting database),
  * Date and time of visits to Web pages, and
  * Number of times a user has clicked on an advertisement.  




In addition, some advertisers or Web publishers may provide 24/7 Media directly with anonymous, non-personal, demographic information, and 24/7 Media may enhance this anonymous information with other anonymous demographic information already contained in 24/7 Media's database. This information will be used by 24/7 Media to deliver targeted advertisements to specific computers and to measure ad effectiveness. **How 24/7 Media Uses Collected Information**  
24/7 Media uses Anonymous Data to:

  * Deliver targeted ads to anonymous, demographically or psycho-graphically profiled computer browsers;  

  * Ensure that when an online user clicks on an advertisement, that user is sent to the correct click-through destination;  

  * Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence;  

  * Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement;  

  * Report to 24/7 Media's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated effectiveness of an ad campaign, the frequency an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics (sometimes called 'Ad Delivery and Reporting Data'); and  

  * Perform delivery system maintenance and quality assurance procedures.  




24/7 Media uses Personally Identifiable Information to:  


  * Ensure that a user receives the goods, services or information that it requested;  

  * Gain a better general understanding of the type of individuals viewing ads and visiting Web sites serviced by 24/7 Media;  

  * Deliver permission-based direct marketing messages, e-mail newsletters, and e-mail advertisements, based on a user's expressed interests or on characteristics of aggregated users; and  

  * Deliver mailings or e-mail messages to those users that have submitted their e-mail addresses or postal addresses directly to 24/7 Media.  




Although not a practice currently conducted by 24/7 Media, we may in the future elect to offer users a choice to have their Personally Identifiable Information linked to their Anonymous Data. Only in cases where an online user has been given appropriate _ _ **Notice**__ and _Choice,_ and has given permission to do so, 24/7 Media may combine a user's PII with Anonymous Data in order to deliver highly targeted advertisements or direct marketing messages to that user. Such linking of a user's PII and Anonymous Data would allow 24/7 Media to enhance an online user's personal profile to deliver highly targeted advertisements and marketing messages to those individuals that elect to receive such advertisements and messages. For more information about 24/7 Media's policy regarding the linking of PII with that Anonymous Data that was collected prior in time to the collection of the PII, click here.

Additionally, in the future, 24/7 Media will only combine a user's PII with Anonymous Data that will be collected in the future if the user has been given robust notice and choice regarding the linking of the PII with the future Anonymous Data. For more information about 24/7 Media's policy regarding the linking of PII with Anonymous Data that will be collected subsequent in time to the collection of the PII, 

click here. **With Whom Collected Information is Shared**  
24/7 Media does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Anonymous Data to unrelated third parties. 24/7 Media provides its third party partners only with access to such information on a very limited basis. Before any access is given to a third party partner, 24/7 Media ensures that those partners with which it has contractual relationships publish and adhere to industry-standard privacy principles regarding the use of such information.

24/7 Media will not share PII with any third party if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information or if such user opts-out of 24/7 Media's databases of PII.

Access to Anonymous Data may be shared, in aggregated, anonymous format only, with 24/7 Media's Web site and advertiser clients who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, and success of their advertising campaigns.

24/7 Media will share or transfer ownership of its collected data if legally required to do so pursuant to law, court order or other governmental action. In addition, 24/7 Media may share its collected data with a third party in the event that the ownership of 24/7 Media is transferred to such third party via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets or otherwise.

 **How Long Information is Stored**  
24/7 Media will store its Anonymous Data and PII for an indefinite time period until such time as the information is updated or deemed outdated. The user profile associated with Anonymous Data is continually updated as a user moves along different websites, and the older data is automatically discarded as a consequence. 24/7 Media stores the URL names that it collects as Anonymous Data for approximately 5 days, after which such Anonymous Data is removed from the database and destroyed.Changes to 24/7 Media's Privacy Policy  
24/7 Media makes available its data collection and privacy practices at [_www.247media.com/privacy._](http://www.247media.com/privacy.html) In addition, 24/7 Media provides users with the option to contact it at [_privacy@247media.com_](mailto:privacy@247media.com?subject=Data%20Collection%20and%20Privacy%20Practices) or [_info@247media.com_](mailto:privacy@247media.com?subject=Information) with any further questions or concerns.

Material changes to 24/7 Media's privacy policy will be conspicuously noted both in 24/7 Media's privacy policy and on the home page of our Web site at 

[_www.247media.com_](http://www.247media.com/) at least one week prior to the change.
