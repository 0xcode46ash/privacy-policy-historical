# Privacy policy | The National Archives

This privacy policy applies to The National Archives' website and all of the services that it offers. It does not cover external websites which are linked to from this website. 

[The Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29 "External website - link opens in a new window") protects the rights of individuals by making sure that any organisation that collects or holds information about living people does so in a way that is fair to those people. 

The National Archives takes your privacy seriously and is committed to responsible handling of personal information in accordance with our Information Charter below.

## Information Charter

We need to handle personal information about you so that we can provide services for you. 

### How we look after your information

When we ask for personal information we promise:

  * to make sure you know why we need it 
  * to ask only for what we need, and not to collect too much or irrelevant information 
  * to protect it and make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn't 
  * to let you know if we share it with other organisations to give you better public services - and if you can say no 
  * to make sure we don't keep it longer than necessary; and 
  * not to make your personal information available for commercial use without your permission. 



In return we ask you to: 

  * give us accurate information; and 
  * tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes, such as a new address. 



This helps us keep your information reliable and up to date.

  * how to find out what information we hold about you - see our data protection leaflet below
