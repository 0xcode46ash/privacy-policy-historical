### 2\. Application Information

When you apply for a product or service on the NatWest website, you will be asked for personal information that is needed to process your application.

The information that you provide will only be used for the purposes described at the time of your application and where applicable in the Terms and Conditions that apply to the relevant product or service. For example, in accordance with standard banking practice, we will tell you that we will provide information about you to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.

### 3\. NatWest OnLine Banking - Banking Instructions

You can use our secure NatWest OnLine Banking Service to access your account with us.

When you do so we ensure that your instructions are provided to us in a secure and confidential manner after you have identified yourself by "logging in" to NatWest OnLine Banking.

Information that you provide, or that we can ascertain from the history of on-line transactions that you undertake using the service, will only be used to carry out your instructions and for the purposes described when you register/apply for NatWest OnLine Banking and in the Terms and Conditions that apply to your account.  


### 4\. Co-Browsing Online Support Technology

We may offer our web visitors the opportunity to interact in real-time with a bank official, via an online chat invitation. This will appear as a pop up window, and users will be offered the opportunity to either accept or decline the invitation. If you accept the invitation, you will be able to direct questions to the bank official as part of a secure online chat session. You can also request the bank official to phone you to continue the dialogue via the telephone

Web visitors do not need to download any software to engage in the chat session.

We include instructions recommending that sensitive information (such as passwords and PINs) are not disclosed as part of the web chat dialogue. The only instance in which our bank officials will ask for personal details will be if you choose to instigate an application via the telephone. And, in such instances, we will only ask for the information required to submit an application.
