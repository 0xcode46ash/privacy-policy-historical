You must not attempt or participate in the unauthorised entry or viewing of another user’s account or into another system.

**Credit reference agencies**

In considering your application we will search your record at credit reference agencies. They will add to your record details of our search and your application and this will be seen by other organisations that make searches.

Searches will also be made in respect of directors and partners of firms applying for credit. Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to other people with whom you have a financial association. In connection with your application you may be treated as financially linked with them and assessed with reference to any such associated records.

If you are a joint applicant or if you have told us of some other financial association with another person, or a director of a firm which is applying for a facility you are declaring that you are entitled to:

·         disclose information about your joint applicant, fellow directors and anyone else referred to by you

·         authorise us to search, link or record information at credit reference agencies about you and anyone else referred to by you

We will use a credit scoring system when assessing your application.

We will also add to your record with the credit reference agencies details of your agreement with us, the payments you make under it and any default or failure to keep to its terms and any change of address you fail to tell us about where a repayment is overdue.

These records will be shared with other organisations and used by us and them to help make decisions about credit and credit related services such as insurance for you and members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt and to manage your accounts.

For these purposes we or they may make further searches. Although the searches will be added to your record, they will not be shared with others.

If you give us false or inaccurate information and fraud is identified, details will be passed to the fraud prevention agencies.

We and other organisations may also share, access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:

·         checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities

·         managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities

·         recovering debt

·         checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance

·         checking details of job applicants and employees

In addition, law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.

For these purposes we or they may make further searches. Although these searches will be added to your record, they will not be shared with others.

We and the credit reference agencies will also use the records for statistical analysis about credit.

Please telephone us on [insert number] if you want to have details of those credit reference and fraud prevention agencies from whom we obtain and to whom we pass information about you. You have a legal right to these details.

**Sharing your information with others**

We will keep information about you and about your agreement on our database. We may pass information about you and your agreement to anyone we have appointed to help administer your agreement, to your credit insurer for administration, claims handling and fraud prevention (which could include passing it to other insurers), to insurance companies or to recover amounts owing or to anyone to whom we transfer the agreement.

You have a right to receive a copy of the information we hold about you if you apply to us in writing. A fee will be payable.

**Using your information for marketing purposes**

We may use your information in order to select and tell you about products and services available from us which may be of interest to you. We may also use your information to tell you about products and services which we can introduce from selected businesses.
