### Security

For security purposes and to make sure this service remains available to all users, the Corporation for National and Community Service uses special software programs to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to this government computer system. These programs collect no information that would directly identify individuals, but they do contain provisions that could help us identify someone attempting to tamper with this Web site.

If you use this system, you should understand that all activities may be monitored and recorded. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring. WARNING -- If such monitoring reveals possible evidence of criminal activity, monitoring records may be provided to law enforcement officials.

Unauthorized attempts to deny service, upload information, change information, or to attempt to access a non-public site from this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under Title 18 of the U.S. Code to include the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we make no attempts to identify individual users or their usage habits.  We do use raw monitoring data logs for determining site-wide trends in usage patterns and in diagnosing system problems.
