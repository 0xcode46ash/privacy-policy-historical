### Introduction

This website, [www.napower.com](http://www.napower.com/), is owned and operated by, or on behalf of, North American Power and Gas, LLC, and its affiliates (collectively, "NA Power," "we" or "us").

This Privacy Policy explains when and how we collect, use, share and safeguard Personal Information through this website, our affiliated websites (including but not limited to [www.napcustomer.com](https://napcustomer.com/)), as well as our products and services, mobile applications and social networking pages. By using this website, purchasing our products and services, downloading one of our mobile applications or interacting with one of our social networking pages, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information by which a natural person is reasonably identifiable. "Personal Information" includes, for example, a first name or initial and last name; a home or other physical address; an email address or other online contact information; and/or a telephone number. When you make a purchase, we will also collect your credit or debit card account information or other similar payment information ("Payment Information").

### Registration Data

When you sign up to receive our products and services, you and/or your utility company are required to provide certain information in order to allow us to provide such service. This information may include your name, Social Security number, date of birth, physical address (including billing, mailing and service addresses), email address, phone number, utility account information (including your billing and payment history, energy consumption data, and eligibility information with respect to medical, elderly, disabled, economic development and other incentives) and Payment Information. We may also obtain or purchase information about you from other sources, such as credit information from companies such as Experian, before commencing service. We may require similar information when you register to become one of our Independent Representatives. We may receive updates of this information from time to time throughout our provision of services to you. You may cancel this authorization at any time by providing written notice thereof to us or by calling us at 1-888-313-9086; however, doing so may result in our decision to terminate your service.

When you download one of our mobile applications such as our rewards application, the information we collect through such application on your mobile device will be indicated at such time.

### Information You Choose to Share

We also receive all information that you voluntarily submit to us, whether through this website or our affiliated websites, mobile applications or social networking pages, by phone or email or otherwise.

### Information Collected From Others

We may obtain information about you from referrals (such as from one of our Independent Representatives) and from directories, websites and other publicly available sources.

### Information Automatically Collected

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, without limitation, Internet Protocol addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

Our websites may use other technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other forms of local storage, including HTML5 local storage in order to collect and track information about visitors to our websites. Information collected from these types of technologies, and from cookies and Flash cookies, is collectively referred to as "website usage data." If you do not want to receive browser cookies, you may be able to set your browser to reject them. If you wish to disable or delete Flash cookies, you should consult the Help file for your Flash application, and/or visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. However, if you turn cookies off (whether browser or Flash cookies), you may not have access to some of our website's features and services. The other technologies that our websites use may not be able to be disabled; if you are concerned about this, you should not use our websites.

Some technologies used on our websites permit our advertising network service providers to serve our advertisements to you as you browse on third party sites. Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

We may also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile applications on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

Additionally, to the data uses stated above, we may use the information collected through cookies and other automated means to uniquely identify the electronic shopping cart you may create on our sites and enable you to retrieve shopping carts. We may also use cookies and other automated means to identify and authenticate visitors.

We may combine the information we collect with publically available information and information we receive from our parent company affiliates or subsidiaries companies, business partners and other third parties. We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you regarding products, services and events that may be of interest to you, for other promotional purposes and for other purposes described herein.

### Google Analytics

We use a web analytics tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We have implemented the Demographics Reporting feature that allows us to use cookies to collect information such as the gender of the individual visiting our site and the age of the individual visiting our site. We use the information we receive from Google Analytics to improve the site and other data uses stated herein. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. [Google Analytics' Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) restrict Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser or [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) for currently available Google Analytics opt-outs for the web.

### How We May Disclose Your Information

We may share Personal and Payment Information with our affiliates as well as with applicable utilities and our service providers to assist us with any of the purposes set forth above (which, for example, might include disclosures to attorneys, accountants, auditors, credit bureaus, data processors, payment processors, and technical systems consultants) to the extent necessary or appropriate for them to perform their services to us. To that end, we may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies.

Please note that we will release your Personal or Payment Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal process. We may disclose your Personal or Payment Information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to detect or prevent fraud or to protect the rights, property, health or personal safety of NA Power, our employees, our business partners, our customers or the public. We may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to do so, or if it is necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us.

NA Power reserves the right to transfer any Personal or Payment Information in the event we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy, dissolution, merger or acquisition. If such a transfer should occur, the privacy policy of another company may supplant our Policy. However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use Personal or Payment Information in a manner that is consistent with our Policy.

### How We Safeguard Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect, including, without limitation, any Social Security numbers we may receive. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring, receiving and displaying Personal and Payment Information on our website. Only those employees and service providers who need access to your Social Security number in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to such information. However, we cannot guarantee that all communications between us or information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers, and your use of our website, products and services demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

Certain states where we operate have specific requirements regarding the disclosure and protection of certain customer personal information; for example, we comply with Connecticut's (C.G.S. 42-470 et. seq.) and Massachusetts' (201 CMR 17.00; M.G.L. c. 93H) applicable rules.

### Your California Privacy Rights

Under California Civil Code § 1798.83, California residents have the right to receive, once a year, information about third parties with whom we have shared information about you for their marketing purposes during the previous calendar year, and a description of the categories of personal information shared. To make such a request, please complete and send us the [Privacy Request Form](http://nap-files-general.s3.amazonaws.com/d92087f345255_CaliforniaPrivacyRequestFormNAPGAR.3.27.15.pdf). We will respond to you within 30 days of receiving such a request.

### Third Party Websites/Social Networking Websites

As a convenience to our visitors, this website may contain links to a number of websites that we believe may offer useful information or services. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those websites. We suggest contacting those websites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies.

Additionally, we may provide you with access to functionality that permits you to post content to your social media account(s). Please note that any information that you provide through use of this functionality is governed by the applicable third party social network's privacy policy, and not by this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, any third party's use of information that you provide through use of this functionality. Please remember that anything you post on a social networking website may be visible to the public.

### Information from Children

We have no intention of collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without the verifiable consent of such child's parent or guardian, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

### Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify our privacy practices and update and make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. For this reason, we encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis. This Privacy Policy is current as of the "Last Revised" date, which appears at the top of this page. We will treat personal information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected, unless we have your consent to treat it differently.
