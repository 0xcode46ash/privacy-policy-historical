**THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT NAAC COLLECTS**  
NAAC generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent.

NAAC allows access to database information by third parties providing technical services, such as e-mail, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. In those instances, the third party is bound by these terms. Your informed consent shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. You understand and agree that we may disclose to third parties your zip code, gender and/or age, but only in the form of aggregated information. In addition, you agree that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of NAAC or its affiliated entities.

**THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS**  
We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.

Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

  
**COOKIES**  
"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of the site and allow tracking of usage behavior. Cookies are used to compile aggregate data that allows content improvements and targeted advertising. We share aggregated data (information that does not identify you) with third parties. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not want non-personal information about your visits collected through the use of cookies, you may set your computer to deny or accept the cookie feature through a simple process in most browsers; however, without cookies we may be unable to provide you with certain features (e.g., customized or personalized delivery of information) otherwise available on The Websites. 

  
**CHILDREN  
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Websites are not directed at children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not provide any personal information on The Websites. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information online from children under the age of 18.**

  
**SECURITY**  
NAAC maintains practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of personal information collection through the Sites. A firewall protects the e-mail server to which all personal information is delivered. Access to the information is limited to those employees and contractors who need it to carry out their business functions. NAAC's employees are educated about the importance of safeguarding personal information and preventing unauthorized access, disclosure and use. Finally, we use secure server software ("SSL") that encrypts credit card information (including your name and address) submitted to any of The Websites. This encryption protects this information so it cannot be viewed as it is transmitted over the Internet.
