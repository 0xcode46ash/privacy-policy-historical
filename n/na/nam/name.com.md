# Name.com - Domain registration and digital brand management

We respect your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent. According to the law, domain name registration information has to be made available through Whois…, a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name registration information of each registrant. Since domain name registration information is available to the public through Whois…, anyone can access it on the Name.com LLC website or other web resources that offer Whois…. Therefore, the domain name registration information you provide us is, and must be, made available to the public. At times our customers may be included within searches of the Whois… database; however, any "spam" received through the use of Whois… does not originate from Name.com LLC. 

The privacy policy of this statement applies to our services offered under the domain name name.com and to our subsidiaries or joint venture websites. We promise that we will not use your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this privacy policy. By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. This privacy policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Name.com LLC Registration Agreement. Please do not use or access the Name.com LLC website if you do not agree to this privacy policy. 

Our website uses WebTrends Live to analyze traffic. Unlike some tracking services, WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors. WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data.

The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. In addition, WebTrends Live does not link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address.

Through WebTrends Live, Name.com LLC uses customized JavaScript tracking code provided by WebTrends to track anonymous information about its website visitors' activity.
