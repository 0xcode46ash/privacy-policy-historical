NACHA - The Electronic Payments Association ("NACHA") is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Web site adheres to a rigid policy for ensuring the privacy of any personally identifiable information (name, mailing address, email address, organization, etc.) that may be collected through it.

**Security**

NACHA employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the transmission of nonpublic personally identifiable financial and transaction information over the Internet.  NACHA also utilizes additional security devices, such as firewalls, security patches and anti-virus programs, to protect nonpublic personally identifiable information.  Access to nonpublic personally identifiable financial information is limited, through password protection devices and physical safeguards, to authorized employees as necessary to perform the requested transaction.  We reveal only partial digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer
