What is the NAI? 

The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) is a cooperative group of [network advertisers](http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_members.asp). We have developed a set of [privacy principles](http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_principles.asp), in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission. The NAI's foremost commitment is to provide consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet itself.

Opt-Out

Most content on the Internet-- from the latest political news to up-to-the-minute sports scores and stock quotes-- is free to consumers. Why? Because of effective Internet advertising. The NAI knows, however, that users are concerned about their online privacy. So, our member companies have banded together to give you the choice to "[opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/wrong_browser.asp)" of targeted advertising delivered by each and every NAI ad network.
