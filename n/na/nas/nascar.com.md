With the permission of a guest who is 13 years of age or older, information submitted at the time of Registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Turner Interactive and may be shared with companies that have been pre-screened by Turner Sports Interactive.

Email Policies

Turner Sports Interactive periodically sends out email newsletters and promotional email to our users about products and services offered by NASCAR.com and its advertisers, using email addresses provided on our registration form for site members, sports trivia games, or sweepstakes. Users always have the option of indicating that they do not wish to receive e-mail information from Turner Sports Interactive or its advertisers. Third parties will not contact our users through the use of our email newsletter lists unless users ask to be placed on a list to receive email from our advertisers. Our newsletters may contain hyperlinks to advertisements, but users' computers will not automatically be linked to the advertisements. 

Our site uses cookies to tell us what kinds of content users want most, in recognition of their preferences. This data is used to assist us in creating a site that will best serve the needs of our users. Turner Sports Interactive will remove users (and their information) from our database upon request. Turner Sports Interactive also permits users to "opt-out" of any further email newsletters or contact, through obvious unsubscribe functionality.
