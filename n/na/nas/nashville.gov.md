This information will not identify you personally. The only information we automatically collect and store is the following information about your visit: the Internet domain (for example, "isp.com" if you use a private Internet service provider) and the IP address (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; the type of browser and operating system you used to access our site; the date and time you accessed our site; the pages you visited; if you linked to our website from another website and the address of that website. We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors; learning about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use helps us improve the website and the services we offer. No other information about you is gathered or stored.

**How voluntarily provided information is used**

If you voluntarily send us information, i.e. you fill out a form requesting information, it will be used for governmental purposes only. These purposes could include, without limitation, helping us respond to your request for information; to look into a problem you are bringing to our attention; or to keep lists of interested people (e.g. prospective vendors or employees). We will not rent or sell information identifying you as a particular person (name, address, phone number, etc.) to third parties, without your express permission. We will also not disclose credit card information, except for purposes related to your credit card transaction, or with your permission, or as required by law under the State of Tennessee's Open Records Act.

However, in the future certain applications under consideration might call for the use of cookies. At that time, we will fully disclose this to our site visitors and make clear how this "cookie" can be refused.
