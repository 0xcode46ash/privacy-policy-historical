**Our policy on "cookies"**

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this website, like ebid.Nashville.gov, use cookies to track user sessions. We do this in order to determine if an individual has left the site and needs to log in again. The passive cookies used on this site do not remember you each time you visit the site.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of this website if you do so. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use or navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain web pages that require a login and password.

**Use of nashville.gov by Children**

We do not specifically solicit information from minors or information that will enable us to determine if the user is a minor. Since we do not restrict users based on their ages, we would like to ask parents to assist their children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. We will also ask that children get their parents' permission before providing any information on line. Any information submitted by a minor, will be treated as information submitted by an adult, since we are not able to determine the user's actual age.
