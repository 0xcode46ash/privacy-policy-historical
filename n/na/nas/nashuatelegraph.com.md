Privacy Policy 

**Our Commitment**

Telegraph Online and its owner, Telegraph Publishing Company (collectively, "Telegraph Online"), recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you, our customers and prospects. This customer privacy policy is intended to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information against our users’ reasonable expectations of privacy.

 **User Information**

In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most often and what services users access the most. We only use such data in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. We may share this information with our advertisers and collaborators, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how Telegraph Online users, collectively, use our site and our services. 

**Personal Information**

In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter a contest, purchase a product or submit feedback, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, type of computer, etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. We may also ask you for other information, such as your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, and your specific information needs, in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.

 **General Information Disclosure**

Unless stated otherwise, we will use our best efforts not to disclose information about your individual visits to the Telegraph Online, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit card number to any outside parties unless otherwise required by law. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners as indicated above. Please be aware that any information submitted on a co-branded page with a third party may result in that third party using your information according to its privacy policy. We do not and cannot control such third party uses. 

**The Job Shop**

Our Career site invites users to submit resumes. These resumes are stored in a searchable database. By submitting your resume, you agree to allow potential employers, recruiters, headhunters and human resource professionals to access your resume, contact you regarding employment, and save your resume to their own files or databases. We do our best to ensure only pre-approved employers, recruiters, headhunters and human resource professionals access the database. We are not responsible, however, if a third party, such as someone posing as the aforementioned, evades security measures and gains access to the database at any time. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes.

 **Cookies**

Our traffic auditing tools use cookies to help track when a computer has contacted the site, the location of the computer, and how many times the specific computer has been to the Telegraph Online. We use this information in an aggregated format to give an accurate traffic report to our advertisers. We also use it for editorial purposes, e.g. if a particular topic is popular, we may decide to improve our coverage of that topic.

 **Third parties**

We do not control the privacy policies of our business collaborators, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide links. Telegraph Online users should also be aware that, when personal information is voluntarily disclosed in chat areas or bulletin boards on the Telegraph Online or any other Web site, that information may be collected by others and may result in unauthorized or unsolicited messages from others.

 **Feedback**

We have several feedback forms on the Telegraph Online. Any feedback that is submitted through these forms or through email is the property of the Telegraph Online. We may use this feedback for marketing purposes, or to contact you for additional feedback. 

**Children**

We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that children should get their parents’ consent before giving out personal information. We further believe that parents should participate, and guide their children’s experience on the Telegraph Online.

 **Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about the Telegraph Online’s privacy policy, please feel free to email us at [privacy@nh.com](mailto:privacy@nh.com) or call 603-594-6458 and speak to our new media director.
