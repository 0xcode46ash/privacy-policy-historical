##### What Information does NASW gather/collect and how is it used?

**MEMBER INFORMATION:**  
We are a membership organization; as a result, we collect member information on our members, including email address, username and certain member preferences. At this time, we do not expressly request a user’s proper name, address and other demographic information. However, as we move more member services to the web, we will, by necessity, request and process that information online as a benefit to our members. 

Your email address will be used to send you information relating directly to your NASW membership, such as; membership renewal notices and to recover lost password. Your email address may be used to send you periodic information from NASW, but only upon your express consent/preferences (see NASW communications and Opt-Out sections below for more details). 

**SESSION RECORDS:**  
We collect user session connection information as a means to provide additional security to members. Collecting session information allows us the ability to automatically log out a user who may have forgotten to log out after pre-determined time of inactivity. This is especially helpful for members who may be accessing the website from public computer terminals such as public libraries and Internet Cafes. 

To maintain our quality of service, we may also gather additional data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is not correlated with personally identifiable data about individuals and is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible at www.socialworkers.org. 

**SURVEYS:**  
In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal member research. We use such information to better focus and personalize our service offered to each individual user. 

**COOKIES:**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once per session, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. However, they will be limited in the use of certain areas of the website – like areas that require user logon. 

**TRAFFIC PATTERNS/LOG FILES:**  
We also collect aggregate traffic statistics throughout our site to show the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive from our website, and the ISPs that those requests came from. These statistics are used by internal NASW staff to improve our website and provide better services to members. 

##### With whom does NASW share my member information?

The National Office does not release information about a member other than to confirm her/ his status as a member of the Association in response to general public requests. In the context of approved Association business such as identification of members for leadership positions or public affairs or for established business partners such as the NASW Assurance Services, Inc. and Infocus Marketing, or affinity partners such as Commerce Bank, specific identifying information is provided in order to permit contact. 

The National Office occasionally makes membership postal and/or email addresses available for a one-time use rental to screened and vetted third party organizations offering products and/or services promoting professional materials or training related to the field of Social Work and to individuals performing research specific to the profession of Social Work. Email addresses are not released to any third party except contracted service providers who act on behalf of NASW. Members have the right to have their name excluded from rental lists by contacting the Office of Membership Services at the National Office and requesting exclusion. This can be done in writing through e-mail to [membership@naswdc.org](mailto:membership@naswdc.org). 

NASW is not able to control the practices of external websites and organizations that we may provide links to. If you have questions, about how such organizations use the information gathered when you link to their sites please read their privacy policies. 

##### How does NASW secure member information?

NASW and socialworkers.org take reasonable precautions to protect our users’ information. When our registration form asks members to enter member information (such as member id, username and password), that information is protected by encryption before being sent to us. Also, the member information you provide is stored in a secure location, and is accessible only by appropriate staff. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to webmaster@naswdc.org

##### How can I opt-out of NASW’s collection and dissemination of my member information?

Members that choose not receive an email will have an option to opt-out by using the “Unsubscribe” statement within the email they receive.
