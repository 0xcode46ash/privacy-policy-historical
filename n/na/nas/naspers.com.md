We use both: 

  * **session cookies** – a session cookie (also called a transient cookie) is temporary and will be erased once you close your browser (session cookies will not gather information from your computer, but they will recognise you as you navigate between pages during your session and will help maintain security during your visit); and

  * **first-party cookies** – a first-party cookie is owned and created by the website you are visiting and stores a small amount of text on your computer (first-party cookies are usually allowed by most web browsers, but if you should choose to disable these type of cookies, the website you are visiting will not be able to track your activity during navigation); or
