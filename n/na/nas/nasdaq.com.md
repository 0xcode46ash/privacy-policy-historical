We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**  
NASDAQ OMX does not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers, in ways that directly identify you. 

_**Personally Identifiable Information**_

**Agents and Service Providers**  
NASDAQ OMX uses outside companies to process credit card purchases. These companies do not retain, share, store or use your personal information for any other purpose. If you sign up for a NASDAQ OMX service provided by a third party under contract with us, we will share your name and the minimum information necessary for the third party to provide these services. NASDAQ.com additionally will display aggregated portfolio information on NASDAQ.com, at no time will we share or display individual portfolio information. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by emailing us at the appropriate contact associated with each web site found in the contact section of this privacy statement below. 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

**Log Files**  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help identify individual web site usage. **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. NASDAQ OMX uses cookies on some of our websites. 

We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help" file. 

Some cookies contain the email address, site logon or first name provided by you when completing an email profile for that site. This information is used to populate an email address box, logon box or display your first name when you logon on the site, respectively. Where appropriate some sites generate disclaimer/notice cookies to confirm that you have read and agreed to its terms of use. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by all NASDAQ OMX web sites and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. [See the “Third Party advertising " section.] 

**Flash LSOs** Some third parties use Flash LSOs also known as Flash cookies, on our sites to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/ Embedded Pixels)**  
In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits. The site usage information collected by these technologies is associated with cookies and may provide data about site use by registered users of NASDAQ OMX Web sites. This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates. Any data linking the information gathered by clear gifs to a user's personally identifiable information is used for internal tracking purposes only. We will not disclose or divulge such data linkages outside of NASDAQ OMX. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to <http://www.omniture.com/>

**Third Parties**  
NASDAQ OMX uses an outside company (CyberSource Corporation) to process credit card purchases. This company does not retain, share, store or use your personal information for any other purpose.

**Third Party Advertising**  
We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
