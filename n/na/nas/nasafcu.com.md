The NASA Federal Credit Union [Privacy Policy](http://www.nasafcu.com/pdfs/Privacy%20Policy.pdf) describes how we use and protect your information. We believe that protecting your privacy is one of the most important parts of the service we provide to you. 

At NASA Federal Credit Union, we value your relationship and we work every day to honor the trust you place in us. Thank you for choosing NASA Federal Credit Union for your financial needs. 

## Web Site Privacy

As a general policy, we do not automatically collect personal information from our Web site users. We do collect and store information on the domain used to access our Web site, the Internet address of the Web site from which a user links to the Credit Union's Web site and the date and time of the visit to our Web site. This information is used only to measure the number of visitors to our Web site and the route a user travels while within the Credit Union's Web site to better serve users in improved design and site navigation. 

## Member-Only Areas

Personal identification, such as your account number and password, is collected when a valid Credit Union member with active Credit Union account(s) enters the secure online banking area of the Credit Union's Web site. This information enables the Credit Union to regulate access of this information to those who request such access and those entitled to perform transactions on these account(s). 

## Cookies

Our Web site may use cookies (small pieces of information sent by our Web server to a visitor's Web browser that reminds our site about the user the next time he or she visits). We do not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. We use cookies only to enhance a member's online banking session and ease navigation through our Web site. 

For certain applications, such as online banking, cookies are required to help protect the privacy of a member's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the member forgets to log out. Cookies cannot be used to capture a user's email address, obtain data from the user's hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about the user. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from the user's browser. The user has the option to set his or her browser to notify before accepting a cookie to control whether a cookie is accepted or rejected. 

## Online Forms

NASA Federal Credit Union provides several online forms (for example, loan application or check order) to better serve the needs of members. Personal information provided via any Credit Union online form is used only to process the member's request for service. These forms are transmitted via secured means. However, if the user is concerned about the security of transmitting this information via the Internet, the member is encouraged to contact the Credit Union directly at **301-249-1800** or **1-888-NASA-FCU** (1-888-627-2328) to transmit the information another way. 

## E-mail Communication

We may use personal information you transmit to us to respond to inquiries for service or information, or improve the service the Credit Union provides. Since e-mail communication may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals, users may want to seek alternatives to e-mail when it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. 

**NASA Federal Credit Union will not transmit sensitive or personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy when communicating via e-mail.**

## Guarding Your Own Information

NASA Federal Credit Union recommends that you take the following precautions to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information: 

  * Never provide personal information, such as your Social Security Number, account or credit card information over the phone unless you have initiated the call. 
  * Ensure that your computer has the most current virus detection and/or firewall protection. 
  * Safeguard your ATM, credit and debit cards. 
  * Memorize Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and refrain from writing PINs, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers where they can easily be found. 
  * Keep your financial records and personal information in a secure location. 
  * Never preprint your Social Security Number and driver's license number on your checks. 
  * Review your account statements regularly and report any suspicious charges. 
  * Check your credit at least once each year.
