## Making Security a Priority

Keeping financial information secure is one of NASA Federal Credit Union’s most important financial responsibilities. 

**NASA Federal Credit Union is committed to protecting the security and integrity of member information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose.**

For example:

  * Employees are authorized to access member information only when they have a business reason to know this information. They are bound by our code of conduct, which includes standards to protect member confidentiality and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so.
  * Policies and procedures covering the physical security of workplaces and records are properly maintained.

**NASA Federal Credit Union collects and maintains information to service your account, save you time and better respond to your needs. In the course of serving you, we collect information about you from a variety of sources, which may include:**

**Application Information** — information you provide to us on applications or forms, such as your assets, income and credit obligations.  
**Consumer Report Information** — information from credit reports including credit history and creditworthiness.  
**Transaction and Account Experience** — information about your transactions and account experiences with NASA Federal Credit Union, such as account balances, payment history and credit card usage.  
**Information from Outside Sources** — information from outside sources regarding your employment, credit and other relationships. 

As required by the USA PATRIOT Act, we also collect information and take actions necessary to verify your identification. 

**Information we collect may be used by NASA Federal Credit Union, as well as by authorized third parties (described below) to:**

  * **Protect your accounts** from unauthorized access and identity theft.
  * **Process your requests** such as loan applications, purchases and ATM withdrawals.
  * **Service your accounts** by issuing checks, ATM cards and account statements.
  * **Keep you informed** about financial services of interest to you. 



**We may disclose the information we collect, as described previously, with nonaffiliated third parties that act on our behalf.**

All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential and to use the member information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform. These companies may include companies that perform support services for us, such as data processors, statement processors, check printers, card issuers, or companies that help us market NASA Federal Credit Union services. 

In other situations, we may also disclose member information we collect to third parties as permitted or required by law. In these situations, third parties may include credit bureaus, government entities, courts or other entities (in response to subpoenas and other legal processes) and those with whom you have allowed us to share information. 

Some state laws may impose additional restrictions on the disclosure of member information in those states to nonaffiliated third parties for certain purposes. 

This disclosure applies to members who have, or have had a member relationship with NASA Federal Credit Union and those individuals who do business with us. 

The policies and practices described in this disclosure are subject to change, but we will communicate any significant changes to you as required by applicable law. The policies and practices described in this disclosure replace all previous notices or statements regarding this subject. 

## Web Site Privacy

As a general policy, we do not automatically collect personal information from our Web site users. We do collect and store information on the domain used to access our Web site, the Internet address of the Web site from which a user links to the Credit Union's Web site and the date and time of the visit to our Web site. This information is used only to measure the number of visitors to our Web site and the route a user travels while within the Credit Union's Web site to better serve users in improved design and site navigation. 

## Member-Only Areas

Personal identification, such as your account number and password, is collected when a valid Credit Union member with active Credit Union account(s) enters the secure online banking area of the Credit Union's Web site. This information enables the Credit Union to regulate access of this information to those who request such access and those entitled to perform transactions on these account(s). 

## Cookies

Our Web site may use cookies (small pieces of information sent by our Web server to a visitor's Web browser that reminds our site about the user the next time he or she visits). We do not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. We use cookies only to enhance a member’s online banking session and ease navigation through our Web site. 

For certain applications, such as online banking, cookies are required to help protect the privacy of a member's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the member forgets to log out. Cookies cannot be used to capture a user's email address, obtain data from the user's hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about the user. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from the user's browser. The user has the option to set his or her browser to notify before accepting a cookie to control whether a cookie is accepted or rejected. 

## Online Forms

NASA Federal Credit Union provides several online forms (for example, loan application or check order) to better serve the needs of members. Personal information provided via any Credit Union online form is used only to process the member's request for service. These forms are transmitted via secured means. However, if the user is concerned about the security of transmitting this information via the Internet, the member is encouraged to contact the Credit Union directly at **301-249-1800** or **1-888-NASA-FCU** (1-888-627-2328) to transmit the information another way. 

## E-mail Communication

We may use personal information you transmit to us to respond to inquiries for service or information, or improve the service the Credit Union provides. Since e-mail communication may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals, users may want to seek alternatives to e-mail when it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. 

**NASA Federal Credit Union will not transmit sensitive or personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy when communicating via e-mail.**

## Guarding Your Own Information

NASA Federal Credit Union recommends that you take the following precautions to guard against the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information: 

  * Never provide personal information, such as your Social Security Number, account or credit card information over the phone unless you have initiated the call. 
  * Ensure that your computer has the most current virus detection and/or firewall protection. 
  * Safeguard your ATM, credit and debit cards. 
  * Memorize Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and refrain from writing PINs, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers where they can easily be found. 
  * Keep your financial records and personal information in a secure location. 
  * Never preprint your Social Security Number and driver’s license number on your checks. 
  * Review your account statements regularly and report any suspicious charges. 
  * Check your credit at least once each year. 
  * Carry your Social Security Card only when necessary. 
  * Cancel unused credit cards. 
  * Tear up or shred unused preapproved credit offers, credit card receipts, cancelled checks, pay stubs and financial documents. 
  * Report lost or stolen checks, credit and debit cards immediately. 



## Assistance to Victims of Identity Theft
