# NASA Federal Credit Union

NASA Federal Credit Union recognizes and respects the privacy of its members and individuals who do business with us. We are dedicated to protecting the personal and financial information of members with the same safety and confidentiality standards used in the transaction of all NASA Federal Credit Union interactions. To assure the continued privacy and confidentiality of your personal and financial information, NASA Federal Credit Union observes these practices and procedures: 

Information We Collect

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from some or all of the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;
  * Information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; and,
  * Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency.

Web Site Information

As a general policy, we do not automatically collect personal information from users of our Web site. We do collect and store information on the domain used to access our Web site, the Internet address of the Web site from which a user links to the credit union's Web site and the date and time of the visit to our Web site. This information is used only to measure the number of visitors to our Web site and the route a user travels while within the credit union's Web site to better serve users in improved design and site navigation. 

Member-Only Areas: Personal identification (for example, your account number and password) is collected when a valid credit union member with active credit union account(s) has registered to enter the secure online banking area of the credit union's Web site. This information enables the credit union to regulate access of this information to those who request such access and those entitled to perform transactions on these account(s). 

Cookies: Our Web site requires the use of cookies (which are small pieces of information a Web site stores on a visitor's Web browser to remind the site about the user the next time he or she visits the site). We do not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies. We use cookies only to enhance members' online banking session and ease navigation through our Web site. For certain applications, such as online banking, cookies are required to help protect the privacy of a member's transactions by, for example, automatically terminating the online session if the member forgets to log out. Cookies cannot be used to capture a user's email address, obtain data from the user's hard drive or gain confidential or sensitive information about the user. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Some Web sites, however, use cookies to obtain information from the user's browser. The user has the option to set his or her browser to notify before accepting a cookie to control whether a cookie is accepted or rejected. 

Online Forms: We provide several online forms (for example, loan application or check order) to better serve the needs of members. Personal information provided by a user via any of the credit union's online forms is used by us only to process the member's request for service. These forms are transmitted via secured means. However, if the user is concerned about the security of transmitting this information via the Internet, the user is encouraged to contact the credit union directly at 301-249-1800 or toll-free at 888-NASA-FCU to transmit the information another way. 

Email Communication: Personal information transmitted to us by you may be used by us to respond to inquiries for service or information or improve the service the credit union provides. Since email communication may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals, users may want to seek alternatives to email when it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. Likewise, the credit union will not transmit sensitive or personal information that can compromise or violate a user's privacy when communicating via email. 

Information We Disclose

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about members, former members and other individuals who do business with us to anyone, except as permitted by law. We may disclose all of the information we collect from members, as described above, to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 

We Maintain Accurate Information About You To The Best Of Our Ability

Maintaining accurate information about your accounts is our highest priority. We appreciate any help you can provide us to do so. If you are aware of any inaccuracies or irregularities in your accounts, including name and address changes, notify us immediately in writing. For statement errors, notify us within 60 days of receiving your statement or we will presume your statement is correct. Consumer Reporting Agencies: Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to notify us if you believe we have reported inaccurate information about your account to any Consumer Reporting Agency. Send written notification with your complete name, address, Social Security number, member number, type of account, specific item of dispute and the reason why you believe the information reported is in error. Mail your notification to NASA Federal Credit Union; P.O. Box 1538; Bowie, MD 20717-1538. We will investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies. We will confirm our actions to you. You may also contact the credit reporting agencies directly. The three most frequently used are Equifax (www.equifax.com or 800-685-1111), TransUnion (www.transunion.com or 800-916-8800) and Experian (www.creditexpert.com or 888-397-3742). 

We Seek To Prevent Unauthorized Access

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.
