                respecting your privacy. This School District Privacy Policy applies to the School
                District’s web site and governs data collection and usage of the web site; it does

                Policy and also the additional Terms of Use information link at the end of this
                policy
                    The www.northampton.k12.pa.us web site is intended for use in the U.S. only.
                Information of all users is collected, used and disclosed as stated in this Privacy
                Policy.
                1. Who is Collecting Information
                        The School District is collecting information at this web site,
                     www.northampton.k12.pa.us. The web site contains links to other web sites
                     and occasionally allows other sites to use the web site and/or School District
                     name. These sites may have privacy policies that differ from
                     www.northampton.k12.pa.us, and may send their own cookies and web
                     beacons to you, and may collect data and make uses of that information that
                     the School District would not. Your use of the information or materials on
                     these linked sites is purely voluntary and you should thoroughly review the
                     legal documents on these web sites before using them. The School District in
                     no way indicates its endorsement, recommendation, or preferences. This
                     Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use.

                                                                                         Privacy

             TERMS OF USE POLICY.]
         2. What and How Information is Collected
                Information collected online is generally either anonymous or personally
         identifiable. Anonymous information refers to data that is not tied to a specific
         individual. For example, the School District collects what areas users visit most
         frequently, what services users access the most, IP addresses, referral data,
         browser and platform type, information about the visits to the School District's
         pages, daily number of visitors and their locations, daily requests for particular
         files and accesses to particular sections of the site. This information helps us
         determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually
         create a better overall experience for you.
                Personally identifiable information refers to data that specifically states
         who you are. The School District collects personally identifiable information
         online from your registration, the “contact us” form, and the electronic
         correspondence you send to the School District. This online information may be
         combined with offline personal information collected about you. Examples of
         personal information collected included, your name, postal address, email address,
         and telephone number.
                The School District does not condition participation in any of our online
         activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to
         participate in the activities.
                We retain all of the information we gather about you in an effort to make
         your repeated use more efficient, practical and relevant. You can correct, edit or
         update your information at any time. You can delete your information from our
         online database or close your account at any time, in which event we will remove
         all of our copies of your information except an archival copy which is not
         accessible on the Internet and will be destroyed 30 days after our receipt of your
         notice to us terminating your account, unless your account is open due to
         nonpayment, legal activity, legal requirement for retention, or another similar
         reason. The personal information you provide is accessible only by designated
         staff. You may request edits or removal by contacting us through the information
         provided in Section 8 of this Privacy Policy: “Contact Us”.

                                                                                     Privacy
       3. How Information is Used and Disclosed
                The School District does not disclose to third parties personally
       identifiable information that is provided to us, except to further the purpose for
       which you provide the information and to those who may be engaged by us
       specifically to handle and deliver the online services. These third parties have
       access to personally identifiable information to perform their functions, but may
       not use it for other purposes. Additionally, personally identifiable information
       may be forwarded as part of a complaint, or as required by law, or as pertinent to
       judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings, or to enforce our Terms of
       Use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our web
       site, the users of our web site, and others.
                We attempt to limit access to our password protected database to only
       registered users, our School District System Administrators, as well as law
       enforcement and national security agencies, but we cannot guarantee that other
       parties will not gain access to this database. We protect our databases through
       password security, and we will comply with legally applicable data protection,
       disclosure, and notification requirements. We are not responsible for the use made
       by third parties who wrongfully access our password-protected database.
       4. Access and Other Data Subject Rights
           a. Use of Cookies
                We reserve the right to use a feature on your Internet browser called a
       “cookie.” Cookies are small text files that your web browser places on your
       computer’s hard drive. We may use cookies for recording your personal
       information such as remembering user names, passwords, preferences, tracking
       click streams, and for load balancing. Through the use of cookies, we will be able
       to deliver faster services, consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site
       experience. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the
       preferences or options menus in your browser, but doing so will diminish its
       functionality.
            b. Internet Tags/Web Beacons, Other Tracking Capabilities
                We do not use Internet tags, web beacons, spyware, keyloggers, or any
       other passive tracking on this web site.

                                                                                     Privacy
       5. Security Measures
               The School District is committed to protecting the security of your
       personal information gathered online. We use a variety of security technologies
       and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized
       access, use, accidental loss, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal
       information you provide on computer systems with limited access that is located
       in controlled facilities. Only necessary authorized personnel have access to the
       information you provide to us. When we transmit highly confidential information
       over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure
       Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized
       third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal
       information for improper purposes.
               You are ultimately responsible for the security of your username and
       password. Please take care when using and storing them. The School District
       recommends that you do not share your password with anyone.
               You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to
       ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence,
       especially if several people have access to your personal computer or you are
       using a computer in a public place.
       6. Effective Date and How Changes to this Policy Will be Handled
               The School District provides its registered users the ability to access and
