# Nashville > Privacy and Security

## What information is collected from you and why

If all you do during your visit to nashville.gov is browse the site, download information or read pages, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information will not identify you personally.

We **do not** use this data for marketing or commercial purposes.

The only information we automatically collect and store is the public information collected by Google Analytics, such as:

  1. Your **Fully Qualified Domain Name** (Domain Name), of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain name specifically assigned to it.
  2. Your **IP Address** (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site
  3. The **Browser Type** you use to access our site (e.g. Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
  4. The **Operating System** you use to access our site (e.g. Windows 8, Mac OSX, Linux, etc.)
  5. The **Date and Time** you accessed our site
  6. The Pages you visited
  7. The **Uniform Resource Locator** (URL) of the page you started from (for example: google.com), that linked you to our web site, if you did not access our page by typing in
  8. Any additional non-private information that is readily available using [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/). 



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Learning about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technologies they use, helps us improve the web site and the services we offer. In order to accomplish these goals, we are constantly conducting statistical analyses of the data we collect and are aggressively improving our hardware and software to meet your needs.

## How voluntarily provided information is used

If you voluntarily send us information, i.e. you fill out a form requesting information, it will be used for governmental purposes only, although it would be subject to disclosure to the extent required by law by the State of Tennessee’s Open Records Act. Such governmental purposes could include, without limitation:

  1. Helping us respond to your request for information 
  2. To look into a problem you are bringing to our attention 
  3. To keep lists of interested people (e.g. prospective vendors or employees) 



We will not rent or sell information identifying you as a particular person (name, address, phone number, etc.) to third parties, without your express permission, although again, this information would be subject to disclosure to the extent required by law by the State of Tennessee’s Open Records Act, and we may charge a fee to recover any costs expended in responding to a request under that act. We will not disclose credit card information, except for purposes related to your credit card transaction, or with your permission. 

## Our policy on "cookies"

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this web site, like [http://ebid.nashville.gov](http://ebid.nashville.gov/), use cookies to track user sessions. We do this in order to determine if an individual has left the site and needs to log in again. The passive cookies used on this site do not remember you each time you visit the site.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of this web site if you do so. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use or navigate through many parts of our web site, except access to certain web pages that require a login and password.

## Hosting of some parts of Nashville.gov by outside parties

Some content on portions of this web site resides on servers run by non-nashville.gov parties. The non-nashville.gov parties have direct control of what information is automatically gathered, whether cookies are used, and how voluntarily provided information is used, and thus we cannot represent that they abide by this privacy policy. We are working toward integrating the entire web site on our servers so that we can guarantee our privacy statement across the site. Below are listed some of those Metro departments and associated agencies that are currently hosted by outside parties:

  * Adventure Science Center
  * Airport Authority
  * Credit Union
  * Justice Integration Services
  * Metro Nashville Public Schools
  * Metropolitan Transit Authority
  * Nashville Arena (Bridgestone Arena)
  * Nashville Convention Center
  * Nashville Electric Service
  * Property Assessor
  * Tennessee State Fair



## Use of Nashville.gov by Children

We do not specifically solicit information from minors or information that will enable us to determine if the user is a minor. Since we do not restrict users based on their ages, we would like to ask parents to assist their children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. We will also ask that children get their parents' permission before providing any information on line. Any information submitted by a minor, will be treated as information submitted by an adult, since we are not able to determine the user's actual age.

## Intellectual Property

The content of Nashville.gov's web pages is copyrighted and contains some third party graphics/images that are used with the copyright holder's consent. If you wish to use any of this content, you must obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or otherwise using those graphics/images.

_Nashville.gov reserves the right to change this policy without notice._

## Security

The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (“Metro”) is committed to the responsible use of the information entrusted to it and to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of that information. However, information security in not an absolute and Metro cannot absolutely guarantee the security of the information that it handles. Metro does strive to maintain a reasonable continuous process for implementing, reviewing and improving data security.

We aspire to fully protect citizen information through the use of multiple information security controls, including technical, administrative and physical controls.
