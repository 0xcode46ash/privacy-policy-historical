10\. **Links, advertisers, third party sponsors & ad-servers**: Some of our sites contain links to other sites that are not covered by this Privacy Policy and where information practices may be different from ours. Users should consult the other sites' privacy policies on such third party sites before submitting any Personal Data, as we are not responsible for and have no control over Personal Data that is submitted to, or collected by, these third-party sites.

These third parties can obtain Personal Data that you voluntarily submit to them to make use of the offer. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data by these third parties. However, you will be informed, at the point of collection of such personally identifiable information, if these third parties will obtain such information, how it will be processed and to whom it will be transferred. At some of our sites, third parties may present or serve advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies by such third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

  
11\. **Will my Personal Data be transferred out of the UK?** As the Nando’s operates globally, it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Data internationally. In particular, your Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in the United Kingdom where the Nando’s central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of other countries, may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Economic Area. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.

  
12\. **How can I find out what Personal Data the Nando’s holds about me?** To see the Personal Data we have collected through this site that relates to you, to cancel it and/or to correct or update this Personal Data, please email us at the forms in the ‘Contact us’ section. In addition, we will always give you the opportunity to update your preferences regarding our use of your Personal Data. To protect your privacy and security we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access. If you have any additional questions about Personal Data we hold about you, please contact us or visit [www.nandos.co.uk/contactus](http://www.nandos.co.uk/contactus).  


13\. **Nando’s application and our use of Facebook user data** Nando’s has an official application for iPhone, iPad, iPod and Android, available for download via [http://www.nandos.co.uk/app](https://web.archive.org/web/20130621041051id_/http%3A//www.nandos.co.uk/app) This application will access information from user’s Facebook accounts once they give us permission to do so whilst using the Facebook-related functionality of the application. Once permission is granted, the Nando’s application accesses a user’s friends list and location only.

The Nando's "Find Yourself" Facebook application <https://apps.facebook.com/nandosfindyourself> will access information from users' Facebook accounts once they give us permission to do so. Once permission is granted, the application accesses a user's name, gender, birthday, locale, email address and spice result.

14\. **What if I am under the age of 14?** It is important to us that children can enjoy our sites in a responsible fashion. We therefore require children under fourteen (14) years old to consult with their parents before providing Personal Data. We also encourage parents to supervise their children's online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other Personal Data without parental permission. Your child's privacy is important to us. We are committed to safeguarding children's Personal Data collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over Personal Data while exploring the Internet. To this end, we take additional measures to protect the privacy of our younger users. Users of this site may participate in many activities without providing any Personal Data. However, if a user wants to participate in certain interactive features on our sites, we ask the user to provide us with certain information, such as the user's email address and age. When the user who registers indicates that he or she is under fourteen (14) years old, we will take one of four steps: (1) collect no information from that user; (2) require the user to provide a parent's verifiable consent; (3) collect only the user's email address to respond to the user's specific request; or (4) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or to notify them of their child's online activities. We also use the email addresses of parents to enable them to unsubscribe their child from a newsletter or other similar activity. We do not share Personal Data regarding users under the age of fourteen (14) with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy without prior parental consent. Even with the parents' consent, if a user is under the age of fourteen (14), we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. While we want children to enjoy our websites, please note that, unless stated otherwise on this site, SMS, MMS and other mobile services are only available to users who are at least fourteen (14) years of age. We do not encourage users under the age of fourteen (14) to provide Personal Data to us (such as their mobile phone or PDA contact details) in order to subscribe to such services. However, if you are a parent and would like to review any Personal Data that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's Personal Data or if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or practices, you may contact us through the contact us forms on the website ([www.nandos.co.uk/contactus](http://www.nandos.co.uk/contactus)) or write to Nando’s Customer Care, Erico House, 93-99 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London SW15 2TG.

  
15\. **Changes to this Privacy Policy:** From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect company initiatives, changes in the law or technology or changes in our practices regarding the collection and use of Personal Data. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted on this site so that you are always informed of the latest version. The date of the most recent revisions will appear at the top of this page. We will not use or disclose Personal Data provided to us pursuant to this Privacy Policy in ways other than the ones described above, without informing you and providing you with the opportunity to consent to such modified conditions concerning the use and disclosure of your Personal Data.

  
16\. **How can I contact Nando’s?** If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy please feel free to contact us via the contact us forms on our website ([www.nandos.co.uk/contactus](http://www.nandos.co.uk/contactus)) or write to Nando’s Customer Care, Erico House, 93-99 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London SW15 2TG. If any provision of this Privacy Policy is judged to be illegal, void or unenforceable due to applicable law [or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction] it shall be deemed deleted and the continuation in full force and effect of the remainder of the provisions will not be prejudiced unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the substantive purpose of this Privacy Policy is then frustrated, in which case you may contact Nando’s at the above address in order to opt-out of the Privacy Policy.
