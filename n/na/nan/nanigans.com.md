# Privacy Policy | Nanigans – Predictive Lifetime Value SaaS Platform for Performance Marketing at Scale

**Privacy Policy**

**Introduction**

At Nanigans (the “Company”, “us”), we take privacy issues seriously.  The following is an outline of the ways in which we collect and use your personal information.

**Information Collection**

Nanigans does not collect or use PII, with the exception of client account information that is voluntarily submitted to the Company.  The only data that we collect comes directly from Facebook and relates to events and business metrics.  Facebook provides us non-personal, statistical reports regarding the effectiveness of an ad.  These reports do not contain any personal information about those who interacted with the ad.  The information that we do receive is generated from ‘clicks’ on our ads and enables us to best provide our customers with affective targeting, and feedback.

To further ensure your privacy, you can manage the privacy settings within your Facebook page.  Facebook will not give away your content or information to advertisers without your consent.

User accounts with Nanigans are only available to advertisers.  For these accounts, we hold user submitted information such as name, username and password in order to authenticate users and to contact users with relevant information having to do with their Nanigans accounts. This information that we hold is not shared with anyone.

**Log Files and Cookies**

Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by the website or app you are using or ad you have viewed. Like most websites, we use cookies to provide you with a better, faster or safer experience.

Cookies and pixels are used to understand and deliver advertisements and make them more relevant to you.  For example, Facebook may read a cookie that tells them you’re logged into Facebook so that they can show you ads that may be interesting to you on Facebook or other websites. Cookies are used to learn whether someone who saw an ad on Facebook later visited and purchased goods from the advertiser’s site. Within our own campaigns, Nanigans may use a cookie to determine whether we’ve shown an ad and how it performed. Facebook may also work with a partner to show you an ad on Facebook after you’ve visited the partner’s site and this may involve the use of cookies.

Cookies are used to understand, improve, and research products and services. For example, cookies may be used to understand how you are using social plugins in order to improve them. Facebook may also use a cookie to understand the ads served by them and their partners.

The cookies within the Facebook advertisements that we run report non-personal data to log files which we in turn analyze in order to best provide our clients with feedback.

**Information Usage**

Nanigans uses the collected ‘beyond-click’ data in order to give comprehensive feedback to our clients regarding the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.

**Compliant with Third Party Privacy Regulations**

Nanigans has engaged in a relationship with TrustE and anticipate to be fully compliant with their privacy regulations in the near future.

**Opt-Out**

If you choose not to receive the benefits of cookies, you may ‘opt-out‘ by clicking the following link.

[Opt-Out](http://www.nanigans.com/opted-out/)

Please be aware that because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser on your computer, you will need to repeat the opt-out process on the other browser(s) in order to opt-out completely. Please note that you will need to opt out of the Nanigans’ cookie again if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change the browser on your existing computer, or delete the Nanigans opt-out cookie.  If you wish to opt back in, you may do so by deleting the Nanigans opt-out cookie from your browser.

**Links to other sites**

Our website may contain links to other web pages.  Please understand that Nanigans holds no responsibility for the privacy policies used by these websites.  We also hold no responsibility for sites to which our advertisements may be linked.

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

If clients wish to change their personal information (i.e. contact info, username, password) they should feel free to contact us at [info@nanigans.com](mailto:info@nanigans.com).

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy is subject to change at any time and we therefore recommend that you check this page frequently.  Any changes that are made to the policy will be noted on this page.

**Data Retention and Security**

Nanigans retains client information for the duration of a client’s active account.  We also hold records of invoices and contact information for a regulated period of time.

We take the security of information that we collect very seriously and therefore implement measures in order to protect it.  However, there is no way of guaranteeing the security of information, given that no method is 100% secure.

**Legal Disclaimer**

Nanigans reserves the right to disclose any and all information as required by law or when it is believed that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with the requirements of any legal process.

**Contacting Us**

Any questions, complaints or general comments should be directed to [info@nanigans.com](mailto:info@nanigans.com).
