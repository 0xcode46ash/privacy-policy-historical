# NAGTROC Privacy Policy - GT-R Life

NAGTROC operates this website, providing services to GT-R owners, prospective owners, enthusiasts as well as companies including vendors and industry representatives. The text below outlines how and why we collect information and what we do with that information.

 **The Information We Collect**  
We collect personal information two ways. The first is information you provide, such as your email address or any other information you willingly provide. The second is information our servers collect, which may not be personally identifiable but may include your IP address.  
 _Note that while we use cookies to retain user preferences, they cannot, on their own, personally identify users without their permission. Also, the cookies this site uses are either on a per session basis or simply maintain user settings._

 **Why We Collect This Information**  
To reliably operate an internet website, itâ€™s necessary to collect user information. Additionally, it is necessary to collect information to run a quality Owners Club.  
Some information, such as your IP address, is needed to provide reliable site access. Other pieces of information, such as your email address, are used to provide a quality experience on the site, through networking, alerts and notifications, spam prevention, and more.  
To further improve the experience for our members, we may, from time to time, request additional information from members that may be personally identifiable. We might do this to help with technical issues pertaining to the website or to assist with matters pertaining to GT-R ownership.

 **What We Do With That Information**  
NAGTROC uses your information to provide the best quality of service possible. NAGTROC does not sell, rent, or provide personal identifying information to any third parties that are unaffiliated with NAGTROC. NAGTROC has implemented multiple security and access related measures to enforce this. Your personal information will only be shared with your consent, except in cases where the law requires it to be shared.

 **Children**  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not provide any information. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete the information
