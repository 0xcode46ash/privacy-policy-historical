# npower - privacy policy

At npower, we’re committed to providing you with unbeatable value and an excellent service. So, we collect the information that you give us when you contact us. Then we use it to provide you with any goods or services requested, to administer your accounts, for risk assessment, for marketing, to analyse your account histories and to generally improve our service to you. We may also contact credit reference agencies who will record the search. If we intend to use information for any other purposes we'll tell you when we collect it and you'll have at least 30 days to object.

  
**Data security protection**

All npower companies comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. We only use personal data fairly and lawfully, and ensure that it is kept secure. Nothing is stored online and our systems are extremely well protected. And, we will not pass the information that you give us to any organisations beyond npower Limited, our associated and subsidiary companies and our agents and service providers, unless we inform you otherwise and you don't object.

**What do we collect?**

We collect the information requested by our contact forms, together with any comments or ideas that you may send us. And we monitor site traffic. Discovering the pages that are of most interest to you means that we can make them more accessible. We will (unless it's impractical) tell you, if we obtain and store information from any other source and also, how we intend to use it. 

**How can you find out what is stored about you?**

Just ask us! You can call us on 01905 720966, e-mail us at [customer.data@npower.com ](mailto:customer.data@npower.com)or write to

The information that you request will be provided within a maximum of 20 working days.  We try to ensure that the information we hold is accurate, up to date and relevant and we'll be happy to correct any inaccuracies.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are files that are downloaded to the temporary internet folder on your pc, in order that it can be identified by a website. They’re often used to help provide personalised pages and to store information on tastes and preferences. At present, npower uses cookies to enable certain facilities on the site (for example our savings calculator and the wish list in the homemover section). Our "savings calculator" cookies time out 20 minutes after you leave the site and our "wish list" cookies within 3 months of your last alteration.

**What about e-mail?**

If you’ve said you’re happy for us to correspond with you by e-mail – we will. But should you, for whatever reason, decide you no longer want to receive e-mail from us, you’ll be able to “unsubscribe” immediately.

  
**And if we update our privacy policy?**

You’ll be able to read about it on this page – as soon as it happens.
