# Privacy Policy : National Physical Laboratory

The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is committed to employing best practice in all its activities.

Visitors to NPL's website can be assured that protection of privacy and confidentiality are given the highest consideration.

With the exception of the e-store, NPL does not collect any personal information from visitors to this website, other than information that is knowingly and voluntarily given.

Anonymous information is collected through the monitoring of server log files, such as the number of visitors to the website in a given period, but it is purely statistical and cannot be used to identify an individual user. We use IP addresses from log files to analyse trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Visitors interested in NPL can provide contact details via fill-in forms available on the site. Visitors cannot be contacted unless such information is given. Visitors are also invited to give additional company information but a decision not to do so does not affect any subsequent negotiations or discussions.

Any queries relating to NPL's collection or use of personal information should be sent to the NPL Data Protection Officer. E-mail: [datapro@npl.co.uk](mailto:datapro@npl.co.uk)
