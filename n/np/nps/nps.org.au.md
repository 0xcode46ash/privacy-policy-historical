**Our use of cookies** :

A cookie is a small amount of record-keeping data that a website transfers to your computer. It is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies.

Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. But, to protect your privacy, your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse them.

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies transferred by the **_National Prescribing Service Limited_** website simply contain a unique anonymous identifier which helps us keep track of the number of times a specific advertisement has been seen by an individual computer. This enables **_National Prescribing Service Limited_** to limit the number of times a particular ad is shown to each user (e.g. 3 times).
