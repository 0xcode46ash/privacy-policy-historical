NPD Online Research is a subdivision of NPD that focuses on online research, enabling NPD to gather the valuable opinions of consumers worldwide. NPD has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy by using the information we collect from you through the NPD Online Research website in a reasonable and predictable manner.

Information Collection and Use

** _

Registration

_

In order to become a Member, participate in surveys and access certain portions of this website, you must first complete our Member registration process. Our registration process requires you to give us contact information (like your email address) and demographic information (like your zip/postal code, birth date, or income level), and may also require that you provide us with information concerning other relevant topics (like how you became aware of NPD, and your computer type and Web usage). Your contact information is used to send you a welcoming email once you have registered, to notify you when there is a new survey available for you or to communicate Member news (for example, Sweepstakes Winners, birthday wishes). You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see "Choice/Opt-Out" below. Demographic and other profile data is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and will NEVER be shared or sold on an individual basis. ANY information collected that we learn is from a child under the age of 13 is NEVER used for any purposes without prior permission from the child’s parent or guardian.

_

Member Surveys

_

Our Members have the opportunity to participate in surveys on our website and through emails sent to them by NPD. These surveys collect a wide variety of information on a virtually unlimited range of current topics. Your participation in a survey is always voluntary, and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide the requested information. You should be aware, however, that once you have submitted survey responses to NPD, those responses cannot be recalled or altered and will be aggregated or summarized with the data that we obtain from other Members. The information collected through NPD’s surveys is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and will NEVER be shared or sold on an individual basis. Survey information that we learn is from a child under the age of 13 will not be used for any purposes without prior permission from the child’s parent or guardian. The information we collect is stored and processed in our processing facility, which is currently located in New York, U.S.A. 

_

Sweepstakes

_

From time to time NPD may offer you the opportunity to enter into a sweepstakes for a chance to win cash or gift prizes. To be entered into a sweepstakes, you will be required to submit to NPD certain contact information (like your name and email or street address). This contact information will be used to contact you if you are a sweepstakes winner, and may also be used to let NPD Members know that you won.

_

Refer A Friend

_

If a Member elects to use our referral service for informing friends about our website, we ask them to provide their name and the names and email addresses of the friends they would like to notify. Upon the Member’s submission of this information to NPD, NPD automatically sends an email to each of the friends from the Member. The friends’ names and contact information are not retained by NPD or used for any other reason. 

_

Cookies

_

A cookie is a piece of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website in order to improve the experience of the website user. This website uses browser cookies to maintain information about your use of the website. For example, the cookies record your personal preference for the language you wish to view the site in, to automatically log you into the site if you are a Member, and to monitor the "state" of your current web session on this site. Cookies also help us identify you without asking you to log in again on every page (or every time you return to the website), this in-turn makes your experience at our site smoother and more enjoyable. These cookies contain absolutely no personal and confidential information. A user of this website may reject or delete our cookie and still use the website, but their use of the site will be restricted. For example, the user will not be able to register as one of our members or participate in our surveys, and many areas of the site will not be accessible to them.

Our server log, which records all transactions and the IP addresses that request them, is used to monitor traffic flow on the website in order to manage the website more effectively, analyze trends, track users’ movements and gather broad technographic information for aggregate use.

Sharing

**

NPD aggregates the information it collects from its surveys and uses that aggregated information in its business, which includes sharing such aggregated information with its customers, affiliates, partners, and others. Because the information is aggregated, the data you provide to us is not personally identifiable to you.

In some instances, we may conduct our business through, or with the assistance of or in cooperation with, one or more of our affiliates. This may require that we provide raw survey information to the applicable NPD affiliate. In the event that we do so, however, we will take steps to ensure that the NPD affiliate handles the information in a manner aligned with the privacy principles described in this privacy statement.

We use an independent third party administrator to administer our sweepstakes. The only information that is shared with this administrator is the information that is required in order for the administrator to select and notify sweepstakes winners, and to provide them with their prizes (for example, your email address and language preference).

In addition, in the event that someone buys or acquires NPD, or substantially all of its assets relating to NPD Online Research or its online survey business, the information we have collected from you will of course be one of the acquired assets. We also reserve the right to disclose such information if we deem necessary to (i) defend, or to enforce the rights of NPD or its affiliates, partners or customers, and/or (ii) comply with the requirements of any law, regulation or judicial or governmental subpoena, warrant or other order, or the requests of a governmental or other legal or quasi-legal enforcement body. 

**

Security

**

NPD employs physical, electronic and managerial protections and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure or loss of the data NPD collects on the website and through its NPD Online Research surveys. The data is stored on secure servers, and only authorized employees of NPD have access to non-aggregated data. These employees work on password-protected computers and are subject to NPD’s confidentiality policies and procedures. If you have any questions concerning the steps taken by NPD to protect the security of the data you provide to us, you can contact us using the information provided below under "Contacting NPD."
