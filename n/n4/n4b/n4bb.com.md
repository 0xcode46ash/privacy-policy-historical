# Privacy Policy - N4BB

[Home](http://n4bb.com/) Privacy Policy

**N4BB.com will not share your information with 3rd parties.**  
N4BB.com respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our Web sites. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to N4BB.com will be known only to two parties: you and N4BB.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**N4BB.com Membership**  
In order to register to the site, registrants provide N4BB.com with personal information including name, address, and e-mail address, gender and device info. N4BB.com keeps all such information strictly confidential and does not reuse, resell or redistribute it in any way.

**Traffic Data**  
Each time a visitor comes to the N4BB.com Web site, our servers — like most on the Web — collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor’s domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a N4BB.com Web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor’s activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the N4BB.com sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Use of N4BB.com Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site.

The information about readership and site usage that N4BB.com collects through cookies is aggregated into general reports about readership and not tied to individual identities.

Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that N4BB.com does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are.

**Promotion**  
From time to time, N4BB.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. N4BB.com may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user’s individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant’s personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user’s consent, and N4BB.com will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants’ information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.

**Surveys / Polls**  
N4BB.com will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys or polls of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Other Disclosure of Personal Information**  
N4BB.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information (personally identifiable data such as your name, email address, password) without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law to be disclosed. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum within our Web sites.

**Unsubscribe and Data Removal Policies**  
If you would like to remove your name and e-mail address from our registration database, you can send an e-mail requesting removal to info[@]N4BB.com

**Other Sites**  
N4BB.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites.

**Additional Questions?**  
If you have any further questions or concerns about N4BB’s privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to info[@]N4BB.com.
