# Privacy | nidirect

This page explains the nidirect privacy policy and how it will use and protect any information about you that you give when you visit this website.

## The Data Protection Act

Under the Data Protection Act, nidirect has a legal duty to protect any information collected from you. nidirect uses leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keeps strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

## What information does nidirect collect?

nidirect collects three kinds of information from visitors to the website:

  * feedback (through visitors emailing us)
  * customer satisfaction surveys (via online surveys)
  * site usage information, using cookies and page tagging techniques including JavaScript



## Feedback

nidirect welcomes your feedback.

If you email nidirect for advice or information that we are not able to give, your email will be passed to the appropriate government department, executive agency or Non Departmental Public Body. An example of an external body that provides services on nidirect is the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA).

Once you have received a reply, we will keep a record of your message for a maximum of three months for reference and audit purposes, after which it will be deleted.

  * [How we use cookies](https://web.archive.org/articles/how-we-use-cookies)



## What happens when I link to another site?

nidirect contains links to other websites, both of government departments and of other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to the nidirect site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement of any other site(s) which may collect personal information about you.

nidirect does not pass on to any other site any personal information you have given.

## What happens when I come to the nidirect site from another site?

Where you are directed to the nidirect site from another site (whether a third party site or a government site) nidirect may receive personal information relating to you from the other site(s). You should read the privacy policies for these sites as these will govern the use of any personal information that you provide and which is then provided to nidirect.

## Access to your information and contacting nidirect

If you wish to see the nidirect records of any email correspondence with you, within the last three months, or if you have a query or complaint about this privacy policy or about the site, you can contact nidirect using this email address.
