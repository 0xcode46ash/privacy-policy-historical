# Privacy Policy

Nisbets Plc is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and the procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

## **1\. The information we collect and how we use it**

When you place an order, request a catalogue, or provide feedback using our website, we need to know your name and other information such as your postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and your credit card number and expiry date or bank account details etc. We gather this information to allow us to process your request. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and sub-contractors to provide you with the service you have requested and to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the service in general. We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring web site usage in order to help us develop the web site and our service and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual. We and our group companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our web site or any special service or products which we think may be of interest to you. We may provide this information by post, text message or email. If you would rather not receive this information please send an e-mail to [nothird@nisbets.co.uk.](mailto:nothird@nisbets.co.uk) stating your preferences or follow the instructions on the text message to opt out from future text messages. 

## **2\. Our use of Cookies and other information gathering technologies**

This website uses cookies. For more information on cookies and how they affect your access to this website, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/PrivacyAndCookies/Static.raction). 

## **3\. How we protect your information**

The Internet is not a secure medium. However we have installed a mechanism that uses digital server identities so that you can be sure that the website you access is ours. This is done using one of the internet Trusted Certification Authorities. When you access the secure pages of our site your browser will be provided with an electronic certificate confirming that you have accessed our site and all communications will be encrypted. When you create an online order, request information or leave feedback that is then passed on to the relevant destination using the same level of encryption, this includes credit card verification. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to the servers and the actual servers are located in a secure location which can only be accessed by authorised personnel. 

## **4\. Updating your details**

If any of the information that you have provided to Nisbets Plc changes (for example if you change your e-mail address, name or payment details or if you wish to cancel your registration) please let us know. Please send an e-mail to [sales@nisbets.co.uk](mailto:sales@nisbets.co.uk "sales@nisbets.co.uk") or by sending a letter to Customer Services, Nisbets Plc, Fourth Way, Avonmouth, Bristol, BS11 8TB. 

## **5\. Your consent**

By submitting your information you give your consent to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the web site, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way. Continued use of this website will signify that you agree to any such changes. Because the Internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred outside the European Union. However, we will continue to abide by and apply the data protection and data security laws and principles as set out by the European Union.

We welcome your views about our website and our Privacy Policy. If you would like to contact us with any queries or comments please send an e-mail to [sales@nisbets.co.uk](mailto:sales@nisbets.co.uk "sales@nisbets.co.uk")
