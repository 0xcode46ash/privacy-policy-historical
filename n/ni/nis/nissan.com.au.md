In this policy "personal information" has the same meaning as under the Privacy Act. 

This policy is effective from 21 December 2001. We may change this policy from time to time. Although we intend to observe this policy at all times, it is not legally binding on Nissan in any way. From time to time we may regard it as necessary or desirable to act outside the policy.
