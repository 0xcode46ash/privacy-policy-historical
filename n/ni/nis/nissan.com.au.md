**_Introduction_**   
Nissan and NFS respect and uphold your rights under the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act"). The National Privacy Principles apply to us from their introduction in late 2001.

**_How_** ** _do Nissan and NFS collect your personal information?_**  
Nissan and NFS will generally collect your personal information directly from you and through its Nissan Dealers to whom you have provided your personal information. Nissan and NFS may also collect personal information from our website, from other directly related companies and from our service providers (such as Roadside Assist). 

**_What do Nissan and NFS do with your personal information (apart from your consumer credit information)?_**  
We use your personal information for the purposes of - 

  * fulfilling our ongoing obligations (including warranty, recall, and roadside assistance) to you as the owner/driver of a vehicle we have imported and distributed; 
  * responding to any inquiries or comments that you submit to us; 
  * deciding whether to offer you additional credit or to renew credit; 
  * any other purpose you have consented to; or 
  * any use which is required or authorised by law. 



We may also use your personal information for customer service requirements, direct mail, marketing communications (via telephone, mobile, fax or email), market research, and product development purposes. 

NFS will only use your consumer credit information: 

  1. to assess your application for consumer credit; 
  2. for purposes directly related to the internal management of your loan or the provision of credit; 
  3. in accordance with the consents and authorities you give in your consumer credit application. 



Your commercial credit information will be used in the same way as your other personal information except that it will not be used to access an application by you for consumer credit without prior consent.

**_Who will Nissan disclose your personal information to?_**  
Nissan and NFS may disclose your personal information (other than your consumer credit information): 

  * to each other or related companies;  

  * to the advisors, consultants and contractors we ordinarily engage for the above purposes (such as mailing houses, insurers, printers, lawyers, accountants and other service providers);  

  * to one or more of our dealers on condition that they use it for the same purposes as set out above and only in connection with the Nissan dealership franchise;   

  * any other person or entity to whom you have consented to Nissan and/or NFS disclosing your personal information;  

  * any disclosure which is required or authorised by law, including to AUSTRAC in respect of any suspicious or threshold transactions or activities; and

    2. to a debt collection agency; 
    3. with your consent, to other credit providers for the purpose of assessing your application for credit; or 
    4. with your consent, to guarantors if a credit arrangement is guaranteed. 



NFS will only disclose your consumer credit report information to outside persons as permitted by the Privacy Act. Your consumer credit report information will not be disclosed to our Dealers. Dealers will only be advised of whether or not your application for credit has been successful. 

Your credit information will not be disclosed to a credit reporting agency for the purposes of assessing an application by you for consumer credit without your prior consent. 

Nissan and NFS will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

**_Nissan Website_**   
In general you can visit the Nissan website without telling us who you are. The amount of information that you provide to Nissan will depend on the range and number of services that you choose to use. Particular sections of the Nissan website may require you to provide Nissan with personal information, including your name and email address. Personal information will only be requested if it is necessary to provide a service to you or if it is necessary by law to collect the information. 

We do not currently use cookies on our website to collect personal information about you. 

By using the Nissan website you agree that the internet is inherently insecure and that accordingly we can only use our best endeavours to secure your personal information and cannot provide any definitive assurance regarding security of personal information. Other than liability that cannot lawfully be excluded, Nissan and NFS will not be liable in any way in relation to any breach of security or any unintended loss or disclosure of that information. 

**_Miscellaneous_**  
In this policy "personal information" has the same meaning as under the Privacy Act. 

This policy is effective from 1 October 2008. We may change this policy from time to time. Although we intend to observe this Privacy Policy at all times, it is not legally binding on Nissan and NFS in any way. From time to time we may regard it as necessary or desirable to act outside the policy. Nissan and NFS may do so, subject only to any other applicable contractual rights you have and any statutory rights you have under the Privacy Act or other applicable legislation.
