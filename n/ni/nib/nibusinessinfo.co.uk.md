We are committed to protecting the privacy of all personal information obtained from you during your visits to this website. This privacy policy explains what personal information we may collect from you and the purposes for which it will be used. By using this website you give your agreement to the data practices described in this policy.

The data controller for this website is nibusinessinfo.co.uk, Invest Northern Ireland, Bedford Square, Bedford Street, Belfast BT2 7ES.

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**  
Depending on which website facilities you use, we collect different types of information. The types of information and uses are explained below.

If you are registered, we may use information to: offer personalised updates when you use the website; notify you of changes to our service; and ask your opinions to help us improve our service to you.

**a) Information that you provide to us**  
We collect and process information that you may provide for specific purposes. This could include information such as your name, email address and postcode. We use these details to provide you with the specific information, on product or services that you request from us, and to communicate with you. If you contact us using certain site facilities we may seek some information to help provide you with a more tailored response.  This includes the following:

  * "Email this page" - the email address you type is not retained by us.
  * "Feedback" - you are asked to give an email address only if you want a reply to your feedback. This address is forwarded to the relevant contact along with your feedback. It is not retained on the website.
  * "Contact us" - you will be asked for contact information if you request advice or guidance. This information is passed to the relevant individual within Invest NI or support organisation we believe can best assist you.
  * "Sign up" - when you register for business updates, we will never pass on information other than for the purpose for which it was provided to us.



**b) Website usage information**  
We receive and store certain information whenever you interact with us. We collect web usage information during your visits to our site including information on the date, time, page viewed or searched for, guides printed, tools used, referrals made and other information relating to your browsing activity on our website. We may also use web usage information to create statistical data regarding the use of our website. We may then use or disclose that statistical data to others for marketing and strategic development purposes, but no individuals will be identified in such statistical data.

We collect web usage information to help us: assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; develop and deliver services and information that better meet your needs; inform you of events, services and products which we believe to be relevant to you; and where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.

**c) IP Addresses**  
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
 

**d) Cookies**  
When someone visits our website we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things like the number of visitors to the various parts of the nibusinessinfo.co.uk website. We collect this information in a way which does not identify anyone.

The tool we use to analyse visitor patterns uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your computer to collect information. You can decide if you want to accept or reject cookies by changing the settings on your browser.

We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any personally identifying information from any source. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our web site, we will make it clear when we collect it and will explain what we intend to do with it.

**e) Javascript**  
We use javascript, a simple web scripting language, for interaction with users. We also employ it to collect web usage information for the purposes described above.

**Linking to other websites**  
nibusinessinfo.co.uk contains links to many other government and non-government websites. Our website does not endorse or favour any specific commercial product or business. Non-government sites linked to from this website are present only because they may be useful additions to the information we provide.

A link to a third-party website does not imply endorsement - you must use your own judgement to decide whether the information or service on that website is suitable for your needs. If a website is not linked to ours, this does not mean or imply that it is unsatisfactory. The linked websites are regularly reviewed in the light of customer usage and feedback.

We are not responsible for the content of any linked website and cannot take responsibility for the consequences of your using the information or services on linked websites. We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the time.

Websites that we link to may have 'Terms and conditions' that are different from ours. Do not assume that our 'Terms and conditions' apply to other websites.

**Other third party content**  
We embed external content from third-party websites such as YouTube, Twitter and LInkedIn. This content is not published on our website. It is delivered using devices and services provided by such third party sites that can be inserted into our site. We are not responsible for this content.

**YouTube**  
Whilst we have made all reasonable efforts to display only appropriate YouTube videos through the embedded YouTube player, we are not responsible for any YouTube content accessed from our website. After a selected video clip plays, YouTube may suggest related videos, which can be played in the embedded video player. In virtually all cases, these will be directly related to the subject of the selected video. Occasionally, YouTube users may erroneously assign key words to a video. It is therefore possible that an unrelated video could be displayed. Again, we are not responsible for this content. If you are concerned about this possibility, you should avoid viewing YouTube videos from the embedded player on this website.

**Security and virus protection**  
No data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. While we strive to protect such information, we do not warrant and cannot ensure the security of any information which you transmit to us. Accordingly, such transmission is at your own risk. We will not be liable for any damages or loss arising out of or resulting from any unauthorised access to, alteration to or modification of information contained on this website.

We make every effort to check and test our website during production. You must take your own precautions to ensure that the process which you employ for accessing this website does not expose you to risk of viruses, malicious computer code or other forms of interference which may damage your computer system. It is always wise for you to run an anti-virus program on anything you download from the internet.

We accept no liability for any loss, disruption or damage to your computer system or your data caused by using this website or arising as a result of having used the website.  When uploading documents to this website you must take every reasonable precaution to prevent the spread or diffusion of any software contamination including computer viruses.

**Changes to this policy**  
This privacy policy will change from time to time as we develop the range of services on the website. When this privacy policy changes, we will place an updated version on this page and where appropriate we will give you the opportunity to review the revised privacy policy and ask you to agree to it. Regularly reviewing this page ensures that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties. You should continue to check the privacy policy before using this site, even if you have visited it in the past. This ensures that you will be aware of any changes.

**Your rights**  
If your use of this site falls under the Data Protection Act as a personal user, you have a right to request a copy of any information held about you. If you wish to do this, please contact Invest NI, explaining that your interest is to review your personal information. Except where the law obliges us to keep your data, Invest NI will ensure that your data is gathered and/or purged from the servers. Invest NI will need to receive appropriate identification that proves you are the correct person to request the information.

**Freedom of Information**  
In releasing information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 we will strive to ensure that we will not conflict with our duties as a data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998.

**Complaints or queries**  
If you think that our collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate please contact us.
