# Nick Jr. Grown-Ups

Nick Jr's Privacy Policy   
NickJr.com is the place in cyberspace where the youngest fans of Nickelodeon can come with their parents to see their favorite NickJr. characters, learn more about our shows, and have a fun and safe online experience. NickJr.com urges parents and their kids to use and enjoy our website. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the Web. Our information practices are described below. We urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information. 

What Information is Collected  
NickJr.com recognizes the importance of protecting the confidentiality of personally identifiable information, especially of kids. That's why NickJr.com generally doesn't collect personally identifiable information from children. Requests for personally identifiable information do appear on the portions of NickJr.com directed to parents and other grownups. NickJr.com has taken steps to alert users that certain areas of the site where personally identifiable information is collected are restricted to grownups only. We provide "bumper pages" at certain points to let users know that they're entering an area that's limited to parents and other adults. We include warnings that portions of the site are intended for grown-ups only. And we've designed the content and language of those areas so that they're clearly directed at grownups, not kids. If we were to discover that children submitted personally identifiable information, NickJr.com would delete the information immediately. 

As for grownups, we request only the personally identifiable information that is required to ensure their effective use of our website and do not condition participation on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary. We do not sell, distribute, trade or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information obtained from a user to any third party, either within our own company or outside it, unless the user has provided his or her consent. 

Games  
On NickJr.com, kids and their parents can play games based on NickJr. shows. Some games may give users the option of submitting their first name, but no personally identifiable information is collected. Some parts of the games' area are animated using downloadable applications from Macromedia's Shockwave/Flash. We also make video and audio available through Apple's Quicktime and RealNetworks' Media-Player. Macromedia, Apple and RealNetworks each operate under their own information collection practices, which are disclosed at www.macromedia.com, www.apple.com, and www.realnetworks.com. We provide "bumper pages" that inform visitors that they are leaving NickJr.com and moving to a separate website with its own information collection practices, and that kids should never give out personal information online. 

Online Sweepstakes  
NickJr.com occasionally sponsors sweepstakes that parents and other grownups can enter online. To enter, the user is requested to submit his or her first name and email address. NickJr.com uses this information only for purposes of conducting the sweepstakes. A fulfillment house may be used to help us select winners and fulfill prizes. NickJr.com requires fulfillment houses to agree to maintain the security, confidentiality and integrity of any information they receive from us about sweepstakes' participants. If we were to discover that a child submitted a sweepstakes' entry, NickJr.com would delete their information immediately. Before fulfilling any prizes, NickJr.com verifies that the winner is an adult. 

Email  
NickJr.com provides parents the opportunity to email us with questions. We request no personally identifiable information from the parent except their email address, which we use solely for the purpose of responding to their questions. The parents' email and email address are deleted from our system periodically. If we were to discover that a child submitted an email to us, we would immediately delete it. 

Electronic Postcards   
NickJr.com gives users the option to send "electronic postcards" to friends and family using various designs. We ask the user to submit their first name, and the first name and email addresses of their friends and family. NickJr.com uses this information only for the purposes of sending the postcards. The user's email address is not included in the postcard or otherwise revealed. All email addresses are deleted within 10 minutes after transmission 

NickJr. Magazine  
Parents may subscribe online to NickJr. Magazine, our regular publication that celebrates the creative side of parenting with activities and projects for kids and grownups to do together. To subscribe, parents are requested to submit their full name, address, email address, and credit card number, as well as their child's first name and birthday.
