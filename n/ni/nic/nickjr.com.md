# Nick Jr. Parents--Play to Learn with Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer, Little Bill and More!

****  
**NickJr.com Privacy Policy**  


NickJr.com is committed to providing quality online activities and information to parents of preschoolers. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to promote the online safety and privacy of our users. 

**Information Collection Policies  
**NickJr.com’s target audience is parents of preschoolers (excluding the Playtime area, which is intended for preschoolers and their parents and which is governed by special information collection policies--please see below for more on the Playtime area) and the design, content and language, as well as our activities, target a parent audience. We do request personally identifiable information from parents who choose to participate in certain activities available on NickJr.com, as described below. If we were to discover that a child submitted personally identifiable information, NickJr.com would delete the information immediately. 

**Registered Membership**  
NickJr.com provides registered membership for our parent audience. In order to participate in our registered member activities, we ask users to submit personal information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, zip code, birthday.) All such personal information is collected for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. Once registered, users can participate in registered member activities such as newsletters, message boards, NickJr.com advisory board (where members will be contacted by NickJr.com for feedback and opinions on various subjects), registered member sweepstakes (refers to those sweepstakes that are open only to registered members; for sweepstakes that are open to all grown-up users, please see "General Activities: Online Sweepstakes" section below) and "Third Party" offers (the opportunity for registered members to receive information concerning special offers and promotions sent by either NickJr.com on behalf of or in partnership with other third party businesses selected by NickJr.com or directly by such third parties.) At any time after the registration process, registered members can choose to discontinue participating in some of the registered member activities (e.g. newsletters, NickJr.com advisory board, "Third Party" offers) or altogether unregister by electing to unsubscribe to such activity, which option can be found at the end of each NickJr.com correspondence sent to users. 

* **Use of Registered Members Information**  
All information collected during the registration process is used for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. For instance, if the registered member selected to receive newsletters, special announcements, offers and promotions from Nickelodeon, we use the information provided by such registered member to send them the requested information which we may send by email and occasionally, by postal mail, for those who have provided us with mailing addresses. The information provided by registered members may also be shared with third parties as more fully described below in "Use of Information" and in the following manner. In connection with registered members who have selected to opt into "Third Party" offers, NickJr.com may sometimes share and transfer the personal information collected from our registered members with and to third party business partners selected by NickJr.com to promote, sponsor and/or fulfill our "Third Party" offers who will use such information to directly contact and send registered members special offers and promotions provided by the third party business partner. Other times, we on behalf of the third party business partner may send registered members third party special offers and promotions, but only if the registered member has selected to opt into "Third Party" offers. 

**General Activities**  


* **Online Contests and Sweepstakes**  
NickJr.com offers parents the opportunity to enter contests and sweepstakes. NickJr.com may ask for information such as parent's first name, parent's e-mail address, parent's birth date, child's first name and birth date and in some instances, NickJr.com may collect telephone numbers for certain types of contests. NickJr.com uses this information for purpose of conducting the contests and sweepstakes and does not (except as set forth herein) disclose such information externally to third parties, except with a fulfillment house which NickJr.com uses to help select winners and fulfill prizes and, in some cases, with third-party sponsors. From time to time, NickJr.com may offer contests and sweepstakes sponsored by third party businesses and may share with such third party businesses entrant information collected by NickJr.com. In these types of contests and sweepstakes, NickJr.com will disclose to potential entrants that such information will be so supplied and the identity of the third party to whom such information will be supplied at the time entrant information is collected and will provide potential entrants with the opportunity to opt out of such third party sponsored contests and sweepstakes. However, any information supplied to a third party may be retained by such third party and will be out of the control of NickJr.com. Entrants of NickJr.com contests and sweepstakes have the opportunity to opt-in (by indicating so on the entry form) to become subscribers of the NickJr.com newsletter and to receive other email special announcements and promotions. Please see "Electronic Newsletter and Special Announcements Subscription" below. The personal information collected from those entrants who have chosen to opt-in to the Electronic Newsletter and Special Announcements Subscription shall be maintained by NickJr.com. For those who elect not to opt-in, and/or entrants who have not been selected as winners, NickJr.com will delete personal information collected on the online entry forms from its system, however, personal information collected online from contests and sweepstakes winners may be maintained by NickJr.com and may be shared with third parties for fulfillment purposes, as described above, as well as internally. Entrant’s decision not to opt-in will not affect eligibility for contests and sweepstakes and will not impact your chances of winning. 
* **Electronic Newsletter and Special Announcements Subscription**  
NickJr.com provides parents the opportunity to receive e-mails containing the NickJr.com Newsletter, along with other Special Announcements pertaining to NickJr.com and/or Nickelodeon. These e-mails will provide subscribers with Nickelodeon information updates, announcements, and promotions. We request no personally identifiable information from the parent except his/her e-mail address, which we use solely for the purpose of sending the e-mails. The e-mail address provided to NickJr.com may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the e-mails and perform other related technical and processing functions. At anytime after the signup process, parents can choose to discontinue their subscriptions to NickJr.com's Newsletter and Special Announcements altogether by electing to unsubscribe, through the unsubscribe option found at the end of each NickJr.com e-mail sent to users.

When customers make purchases on NickJr.com (e.g. games from "Nick Jr. Arcade"), we require them to provide us with their full name, billing and/or shipping addresses, email address, and credit card number/expiration date. We also provide our customers the opportunity to send to family and friends gifts items purchased by the customer and will send, on behalf of customers who request it, emails to family or friends notifying them that someone has sent them a gift. To do this, we ask customers to provide us with their family or friend's first name and email address. We only use this information to send the gift recipient the item(s) the customer has requested their family or friend receive. During the checkout process, we also provide customers the opportunity to receive newsletters, sales and promotions from Nickelodeon. To be removed from the contact list at any time, customers can elect to unsubscribe in the next email they receive from Nickelodeon. If customers do not complete the order process (e.g., fail to enter a valid credit card number/expiration date or fail to complete a purchase transaction) the information customers submitted during the order process will not be captured by our systems. Once customers have successfully entered a valid credit card number/expiration date and completed the order process, an account will be created and maintained for customers. We use this information to process the customer's order and to send order confirmations via email but we do not sell, transfer or share the information with third parties except, the information is transferred, disclosed and shared with our third party agent who uses the information solely to handle and manage fulfillment and customer service, but can not use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
*  **Customer Service**  
In addition to being able to call our customer service department, Nick Jr. Arcade customers may also email us their questions. Other than an email address, we do not request that users submit any personal information online for customer service inquiries. We may however ask for additional non-personal information to better help us respond to customer service questions. We use the email address to communicate directly with customers about technology-related questions, and provide them with answers that they may find helpful. We do not sell, transfer or share the email address with third parties, with the exception that the information is transferred, disclosed and shared with our third party agent who uses the information solely to handle and manage customer service, but cannot use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Once we or our third party agent have had a chance to provide email responses to customer service email questions, the email address is deleted from our system.
