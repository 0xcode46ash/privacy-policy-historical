# Privacy

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (the Institute) respects the privacy of people who use its website and when personal information is used we do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. In order to administer our website, provide email alert services and consult on our work the Institute occasionally captures personal data. This is done in three ways: 

  * **Email notify service.** The website has an optional email alert service which notifies people when new information has been posted on different areas of the site. It also has an optional electronic newsletter providing general news on NICE. If you register for these services your email address and other information given when registering will be held on the system for the purpose providing this service. It will not be passed on to third parties. If you wish to discontinue with the email notification service please contact the Institute. 
  * **Website consultation.** The Institute carries out web-based consultations in relation to specific work topics. Any personal information you submit in response to our consultation exercises may be retained and used by the Institute for the purpose of developing its clinical guidelines and technology appraisals and for work on interventional procedures or other projects specified and may be kept on our database for the purpose of future reference, research and statistical analysis. 

The Institute may wish to publish responses or make them available to third parties such as other consultees involved in our work. The Institute may also disclose aggregated data taken from the consultation process in an anonymised form to organisations approved by the Institute for the purposes of research. If you submit personal data as part of these consultations you are agreeing to its use for this purpose. 

  * **Site access.** The website monitors access to the site for the purpose of system administration of the web server and statistical monitoring of website usage. This may include â€˜cookies'. A cookie is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The message is then stored by the browser in a text file called cookie.txt. Every time the browser obtains a page from the server this cookie message is sent back. A cookie can be used to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them.



The Institute is committed to transparency in its work. This privacy policy only covers the Institute's website at [www.nice.org.uk](http://www.nice.org.uk/). Any links from this site to other websites are not covered by this policy.
