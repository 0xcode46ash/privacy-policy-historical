**Nick UK Privacy Policy**

**Introduction  
**This policy sets out how Nickelodeon UK collects information about you and how that information may be used. You should make sure that you always get the consent of your parents or guardians if you are under 16 before entering any information on our website or sending us information in any other way. If you or if you are under 16 your parents or guardians want to discuss with us how your information is used at any time you can email [letterbox@nickjr.co.uk](mailto:letterbox@nickjr.co.uk) or contact us The Data Protection Officer, Nickelodeon UK, 15-18 Rathbone Place, London, W1T 1HU.

By supplying us with personal information, you and if you are under 16 your parents or guardians agree to the terms of this policy. If you or your parents or guardians do not agree with the policy, you must not provide us with any personal information.

**How do we collect and use your information?**

Nickelodeon UK may collect information about you in a number of ways:

**On our website**  
One of the main ways in which we may collect information about you is through the registration procedure on our websites. We need this information to make sure that you can enjoy all the benefits of registration and so that you get the best out of our website. Registration allows you to use the website facilities such as the message boards and the postcards and enables us to send you newsletters and details of special competitions. You can unregister at any time by emailing [letterbox@nickjr.co.uk](mailto:letterbox@nickjr.co.uk).

We may also collect information about you on other parts of our website but we will always tell you when we are collecting your data.

If you use our message boards, we do monitor messages and will make sure that no information is displayed that would identify you or where you live. However, please remember that any information you put on the message boards is able to be seen by other users of the websites. 

If you send a postcard to a friend via our websites, we will need to collect your friend’s email address in order to send that postcard. However, we will make sure that this information is deleted as soon as possible.

**Competitions**  
We will also collect information about you if you enter any of our competitions. You may do this on-line, over the telephone or through the post. This information will be used to tell you if you have won a competition and to send you any prize. We will also keep your details on our database in order to send you our newsletters and other useful information about Nick Jr. If you don’t want us to use your information in this way you can tell us when you send in your competition entry or at any time by emailing [letterbox@nickjr.co.uk](mailto:letterbox@nickjr.co.uk) or writing to us at the address above.

**Other ways**  
You may also let us have information about yourself in other ways such as if you write to us by post or email, if you call us or if you visit us. We may use this information to contact you about your letter, email, call or visit. We may also keep your details on our database in order to send you our newsletters and other useful information about Nick Jr. If you don’t want us to use your information in this way you can tell us at any time by emailing [letterbox@nickjr.co.uk](mailto:letterbox@nickjr.co.uk) or writing to us at the address above.

**Marketing Communications**  
As we have explained above, we may use information that we collect about you to send you our regular newsletters as well as details of competitions, special offers or other useful information about our channels or programmes. 

We may also ask you if you would like to receive information about the products or services of our business partners that we think may be of interest to you. We will not send you this information without your consent.

Remember, if you do not want to receive any more information from us all you have to do is email us at [letterbox@nickjr.co.uk](mailto:letterbox@nickjr.co.uk) or write to us at the address above at any time. 

**Third parties  
**We will not usually pass your information onto any third parties without your consent. An exception to this is if we need third parties to carry out certain services for us. For example, if you win a competition we will pass your information onto a third party who will arrange delivery of your prize. We will make sure that such third parties keep your information secure and no longer than is necessary. We will not pass your information to third parties outside the European Economic Area without your consent.

Some of the information which you give to us (for example, whether you are male or female) does not on its own identify you. We collect this type of information in order to identify trends in our business. It is known as “aggregate information”. We may pass aggregate information to third parties such as advertisers and business partners to give them a better understanding of our business. However, such information will not identify you personally.

If our business is sold, your information will be passed to the new owner.

**What are Cookies and how do we use them?**  
Cookies are small files of data that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit our websites. They allow our websites to “remember” your activities on our website and the number of times you have visited. We can use the information stored by cookies to help us to provide you with a better on-line experience. For example, if we know that you like playing games on our website, we may highlight new games to you on your next visit.

We do not use cookies to store any personal information about you – only about your computer. We collect “log data” that allows us to tell how many visitors our websites have received, but this data will not identify you.

You can set your Internet browser so it will not accept cookies. For further information about cookies and how to reject them, please visit www.aboutcookies.org. If you choose not to accept cookies you will still be able to browse our website but you will not be able to take advantage of any of the personalised options, such as registration. 

**Security**  
We have taken steps to ensure that all personally identifiable information that we collect is secure, including limiting the number of people who can access this information and using electronic security systems. You can help by ensuring that you keep your passwords secret and properly log out of our websites if you have been using them.

**Access to your personal information**  
You have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you and to have any errors corrected. If you would like to make a request please write to the Data Protection Officer, Nickelodeon UK, 15-18 Rathbone Place, London, W1T 1HU enclosing the fee of £10.

**Changes to this Policy**  
From time to time we may make changes to this policy. We will post a notice of the changes together with the updated policy on our website at [www.nickjr.co.uk](http://www.nickjr.co.uk/)

This policy was last updated on 1 May 2005.
