While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the Web. NickatNite.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 

### What Information Is Collected?

At NickatNite.com, where visitors self-identify as 13 years and older we collect a valid e-mail address and birth date, we may collect additional information including Computer Information (see below), gender, state/province, zip/postal code, and country, and we may ask additional questions regarding personal preferences on a number of topics through surveys. For certain enhanced services, we also may collect credit card and billing information (including telephone number). Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable "computer" information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's "IP Address", the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, information collected through the use of cookies (see below) and information regarding the Internet service provider ("Computer Information").

### How We Use the Information

We use visitors' personal information for our internal purposes of enabling visitors to enter one of our online contests or sweepstakes, to subscribe to our online newsletter, or to inform visitors of upcoming events and special announcements. Each e-mail contains instructions on how to be removed from the subscription list. We also use visitors' Computer Information to track usage, improve the design of the site, offer products and services, to personalize our visitor's experiences, save your password in password-protected areas, enable you to use shopping carts on our sites and to ensure visitors are following the site's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/info/terms-of-use.html). Sometimes we will use agents or contractors to help us provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes and sending prizes to the winners. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of NickatNite.com's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, NickatNite.com may transfer such information and information collected from parents or guardians to the acquiring entity.

We may disclose information about our visitors, including personal information (e.g., registration information, e-mail address, etc.), as well as Computer Information, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the site. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our visitors or others.

### Contests and Sweepstakes

NickatNite.com occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. To participate in a contest or sweepstakes, a visitor is asked to provide his or her name and email address. Sometimes, if the visitor who wishes to enter the contest is under 13, and the contest or sweepstakes may involve more than a one-time contact, we also ask for the email address of the visitor's parent. In those cases, we send the visitor's parent an email within two business days informing him or her of their child's entry and give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information collected by NickatNite.com is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting and fulfillment of the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes if finished, we delete any personal information collected. The information collected in a NickatNite.com sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes. Any such fulfillment house may not use the information for other purposes and must agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information.

### Cookies and Log Data

Unique identifiers such as cookies (which may be html files, Flash files, or other technology), web beacons, or similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies") are used to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated websites without logging into each site, and other purposes related to our management of this site.
