**How do we manage email communications?**

Nimble Storage offers registered users the option of opting out of receiving emails regarding Nimble Storage products, services and special offers by following the opt-out link at the bottom of our email.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
