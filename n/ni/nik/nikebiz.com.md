Privacy Policy

Nike is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site. The following policy describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our site. If you would like to review our policies specifically applicable to children, see "[Children's Privacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603233417id_/http%3A//niketown.nike.com/includes/policies/info_policies_privacy2.jhtml;jsessionid=3DZVQTYAAFTDICQBCBNCFEYKAEIF0IV0)". 

What information does Nike collect and how does Nike use it?

  * When you register on the site, we need you to provide your name, date of birth, gender, e-mail address, mailing address, daytime phone number, and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as create a username and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to us, and receive back either the information or products desired. 
  * When you register, you also have the discretion whether or not to submit your evening phone number, favorite athlete, favorite sport, or other requested information. This allows us to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you. 
  * Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on our mailing list, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from us. 
  * The site contains an anonymous shopping feature for visitors who desire to purchase products without registering. Those who elect to purchase products without registering will be asked only for information necessary to process the transaction and ensure compliance with our Children's Privacy Policy. Information provided by anonymous shoppers will be retained only as necessary to process the transaction and maintain our sales records and will not be used for marketing purposes. 
  * When you enter a contest, promotion, or use certain other site features, we may again ask for your name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, username, password or other information so that we are able to better administer the contest, promotion, or feature. 
  * We may also use the information we collect during the registration process to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new products and services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other communication, simply reply to any e-mail sent to you and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of your reply. 



How does Nike protect visitor information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and who are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. 

Do We use "cookies"?

Yes. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site operator can transfer to your hard drive to help tailor and keep records of your visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow us to better customize your visits to our site to your individual preferences. We also contract with third party service providers who assign cookies (which do not contain any personally identifiable information) to conduct site tracking for us. These companies use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about site traffic. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or notify you whenever you're sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on our site. However, we use cookies to track shopping basket items through the order and browsing process, so you won't be able to place an on-line order if you disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still place orders over the telephone by calling our customer service number. 

Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?

Except for web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our web site, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us unless we receive your express consent in advance. For web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our site, we require them by contract to keep our customer information confidential. 

However, customer information in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

A special note to parents.

We realize that many children will visit our site, and we therefore encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any web site, including ours. However, we believe that it is ultimately the parent's responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the [Direct Marketing Association](http://www.the-dma.org/) home page. 

How can you remove or modify information you have provided to us? 

You may modify your information in our database by visiting the "My Account" section of our site. From there you should login and select "Profile." Then proceed to modify the information you have previously provided. To delete all of your personally identifiable information in our database click on "Take me off of your list" instead of "Profile" in the "My Account" main menu. Please Note: if you request to have your information deleted from our database, we may maintain information about an individual sales transaction. 

Third party links

In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Nike, we have no control over these linked sites which have separate and independent privacy and data collection practices. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, including the privacy practices, of these linked sites. These linked sites are provided only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any [feedback](http://nike-store.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/nike_store/people) about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).
