# Privacy policies at Nikonians

##   
**Privacy policies at nikonians.org and Nikonians powered sites**

We believe it's very important that each user feels confident in our privacy policies, hence we have compiled this privacy statement.

**1.** As a visiting user of any of our sites, we collect the following information: Access date & time, type of browser, country, domain name, IP address and pages viewed. This information is used for improving the content and design of our sites.

**2.** By visiting any of our sites, a cookie (a small file) will be stored on your computer. Our sites may not provide full functionality if the cookie cannot be stored on your computer, specifically login to forums may not be possible.

**3.** If you click on any advertisment or any link on our sites we collect the access date & time and IP address.

**4.** If you register as a community member we store your first name, last name and email address.

**7.** We do not sell any user information to any other party. If you participate in any of our surveys, results from the statistical analysis of anonymized data (that is, bundled and stripped of names) may be provided to our sponsors who are helping us to sustain the growth of nikonians.org. 

**8.** As a registered member, you will receive email information from us from time to time, but this is then information pertaining directly to the community. We do not send out emails often, but when we do we feel that the information is important and that all registered users should be informed about that specific issue. If you don't want to receive any emails from our community, you may send us an email and we will remove your account. This also means that your registration at Nikonians is cancelled completely.
