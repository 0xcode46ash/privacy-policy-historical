# Privacy policies at Nikonians

We believe it's very important that each user feel confident in our privacy policies, hence we have compiled this privacy statement.

1\. We gather the following information of visiting users:

Access date & time. Type of browser. Country. Domain name. Pages viewed.  
This information is automatically stored by the http server in its logfiles and is only used for improving the content and design of this site.

2\. If you register as a community member and store your user profile, the profile information is only used for being displayed to other members.

3\. If you mark the checkbox titled "remember my password", a cookie (a file entry) will be stored on your local computer. This record holds your password and no other information. It is only accessed by the forum software to able you to log in without typing a password.

4\. We do not sell or give away user information to any other party.

5\. As a registered user, you will receive email information from our site from time to time, but this is then information pertaining directly to the community. We do not send out emails often, but when we do we feel that the information is important and that all registered users should be informed about that specific issue. Typically, these emails are not sent out more than twice a month and are very short. If you don't want to receive any emails from our community, you may send us an email and we will remove your account. This also means that your registration at Nikonians is cancelled completely.

6\. If you subscribe to message threads, these messages will automatically be sent to you via email.

7\. If you request to be informed about answers on a message posted by you, you will automatically receive emails containing those answers.

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policies, or any other questions, you may send an email to [editorial@nikonians.org](mailto:editorial@nikonians.org)
