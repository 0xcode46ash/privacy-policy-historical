# Privacy Policy - Nikestore.com.au – Nike Australia’s Official Online Store

Nike is strongly committed to protecting your privacy while interacting with our content, products and services. We want to provide a safe and secure environment. 

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind and how much information you provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy and to give you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have. 

This policy applies only to Nike and not to other companies' or organisations' websites to which Nike is linked. 

Collecting Information  
Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For more information, see "Cookies and Pixel Tags" section below.

We request information from you (which may include name, address, telephone number, email address, gender and when necessary, credit card information) when you:

  * Register 
  * Purchase 
  * Request to receive communications 
  * Participate in a promotion or other website feature



In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine information you give us online with other information from Nike sources, transactions and communications. This may include data from Nike stores, direct mail, events, or online marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other reputable sources. This data may include postal address updates and demographic data. All data combined and stored with online data is protected by this privacy policy.

Using Information  
We may use the information we collect to:

  * Customize and/or personalize your communications and shopping experience 
  * Better respond to your customer service inquiries 
  * Communicate with you about your purchase, account information, or customer service needs 
  * Communicate with you about our products and events, and for other promotional purposes 
  * Improve our business 
  * Administer contests, promotions, surveys or other website features



If you purchase a product from [www.nikestore.com.au](http://www.nikestore.com.au/) you can choose to be added to our direct mail list.

Sharing Information  
For the purpose of operating our business, there will be occasions where it will be necessary for Nike to disclose your personal information to third parties. We may transfer information between Nike and our preferred service providers who use that information only to conduct Nike business. For example, they may handle Nike's credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We may also share your information to administer a website feature (e.g., music download or race registration) and in that case will notify you before you give us your information. We provide our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information.

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

Under no circumstances will Nike sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information. 

Security- Protecting Your Information  
Nike operates secure data networks using a 3rd Party Vendor [Powerfront Pty Ltd](http://www.nikestore.com.au/scripts/redir.asp?link=http%3A//www.powerfront.com/) that are designed to protect your privacy and security. We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
