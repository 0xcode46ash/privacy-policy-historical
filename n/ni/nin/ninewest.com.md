# Nine West Official Site: Privacy Policy

This ninewest.com web site is a service of Jones Retail Corporation.

Nine West respects the privacy of our customers and the users of our website and has instituted the policies and practices described below to ensure that your personal information is handled in a responsible manner. Our online privacy policy describes the types of personal information we may collect from you when you visit our websites or our stores, how we use this information, and when we share it with third parties or our affiliated brands. The information on this website and our privacy policy are subject to change from time to time. Any material changes to our privacy policy and practices will be reflected on this page so that you can be aware of what information we collect and how we are using and/or disclosing it. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by ninewest. 

Our policy was last updated on July 5, 2007.

What information does Nine West collect?  
Nine West collects data that you provide to our sales associates in our company-owned Nine West stores and outlets and the stores and outlets of our affiliated brands (including Bandolino, Easy Spirit, Kasper, Anne Klein, and Jones New York); on ninewest.com and the websites of our affiliated brands through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit. 

Nine West may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information." 

Personal information tells us who you are such as your name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an assigned password to protect your privacy. 

Automatic information is information that we collect automatically whenever you interact with this website such as your IP address, the type of computer you use, and the web browser you use. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. Each time you visit this site, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information. Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons". A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the site may not function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter. 

We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information. 

Finally, Nine West occasionally obtains email addresses of active Nine West store customers who requested fashion emails on other websites. Nine West also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics.

How does Nine West protect your information?  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be unconditionally guaranteed to be secure. Therefore any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk. 

However, when you place an order online, we use encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Nine West. 

In addition, when you create an online account on ninewest.com, you must select a personal password. As a member of Nine West?s website, you will be able to view, among other things, your account profile, contact preferences, order history, address book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should you decide to become a member of Nine West?s website, you will be asked to provide an accurate email address and create a password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about maintaining the secrecy of your password.
