**What information does Nine West collect?**

Nine West collects data that you provide to our sales associates in our company-owned Nine West stores and outlets; or on ninewest.com either through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit.

This includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an encrypted password to ensure maximum protection of your privacy.

Nine West occasionally obtains email addresses of active Nine West store customers who requested fashion emails on other websites. Nine West also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics.

**How does Nine West use this information?**

Nine West does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our Nine West stores. Nine West uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond to your customer service inquiries.

Nine West also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, and to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications either directly to us online or to customer service representatives or to the sales associates in our stores.

**How can you access your information?**

You may access and edit the information that you provide online when you authenticate your right to access by signing in at ninewest.com. Simply click on the "Sign In" link from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information. You can request password help at any time by clicking on the "don't have password?" link at which time ninewest.com will email an encrypted password to the associated email address. Currently, we do not provide online access to information that you provided to Nine West offline. But at any time you may request access to your information from our customer service representatives or our store associates. To alleviate any concern on your part, ninewest.com does not store or provide access to credit card information, which is why you will be required to re-enter your credit card and expiration date with every online credit card transaction.

**How does Nine West protect your information?**

All information input by you and transmitted to our website when you place an order or provide personal information is protected by password and by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your order and personal information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Nine West.

**Does Nine West disclose your information to others?**

Nine West and Jones Apparel Group does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties except for the express purpose of assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to [unsubscribe](http://www.ninewest.com/s?namespace=profile&origin=cs_security.jsp&event=NewsLetterUnsub) from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information.

Jones Apparel Group, Inc. is the parent company for Nine West. Jones Apparel Group maintains a single database of customer information for several brands owned by the [Jones Apparel Group](http://www.jny.com/) family of companies, including [Bandolino](http://www.bandolino.com/), [Easy Spirit](http://www.easyspirit.com/), [Kasper](http://www.kasper.com/), [Anne Klein](http://www.anneklein.com/) and [Jones New York](http://www.jonesnewyork.com/) brands. For each customer in this database, Jones Apparel Group maintains a separate set of contact preferences for each brand to which that customer has provided her customer information. When you establish or update your customer profile information with one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, whether through a purchase, registration or email sign-up at a company-owned or operated website, specialty store or outlet store for one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, through a customer service representative, or in any other communication you may have with us, we will update your customer record on the Jones Apparel Group database. This does not in any way authorize use of your information by the other Jones Apparel Group brands for any other purpose, including marketing and promotional purposes.

Nine West honors every request to [unsubscribe](http://www.ninewest.com/s?namespace=profile&origin=cs_security.jsp&event=NewsLetterUnsub) from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request, not only for promotional emails that Nine West sends, but also for emails about Nine West that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers. As such, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Nine West will provide to such companies the email address of anyone who has submitted to Nine West an [unsubscribe](http://www.ninewest.com/s?namespace=profile&origin=cs_security.jsp&event=NewsLetterUnsub) request, provided such company agrees not to disclose or use such email address for any other purpose than honoring your request to not receive Nine West promotional emails.

Nine West reserves the right to use and/or disclose to others information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.

**How does Nine West protect a child's privacy?**

In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Nine West will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13, without first seeking prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user of our website is under the age of 13 and has provided an online registration without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove that child's personal information from our files.

**Does Nine West use "cookies"?**

"Cookies" are small data files or small bits of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit our website so that we can recognize you. Cookies do not alter your hard drive in any way and cannot be used to access any personal information from your computer. They merely enable us to personalize your shopping experience by helping us keep track of your order as you shop on our website, maintain information about your use of our website, and help us recognize you when you visit our website again. We also use cookies to identify the website you visited immediately before visiting our website and we maintain this information through the use of cookies to enable us to evaluate and improve our website design. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. Also, the profile you build at ninewest.com allows you to request that we do not "remember you", something we recommend if you are using a shared or public computer.

**Does ninewest.com have links to other web sites?**

There may be links on our website to the web sites of others. When you click onto one of these links, you are leaving Nine West's website and accessing another party's website. These other web sites are not under our control and may collect personal information from you.
