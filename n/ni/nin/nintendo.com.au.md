# Privacy - Nintendo.com.au

Nintendo Australia Pty Ltd (Nintendo) is committed to preserving and respecting the privacy of visitors to this website. 

Nintendo is not a party to an approved privacy code, but complies with the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act) and the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) in relation to the collection, use, security of and access to Personal Information. In this Policy, 'Personal Information' has the same meaning as in the Act.

There are no exemptions under the Act which apply to collection of Personal Information on this website.

This policy only relates to Personal Information collected on this website.

**Please read this policy carefully before you use this website or provide any Personal Information.   **

##  What information is collected?

Nintendo will only collect Personal Information from our online visitors to the website for (1) contest registration; (2) newsletter registration; (3) surveys; (4) registration for games or special game-specific promotion participation; and (5) to enable you to join specific groups such as Club Nintendo. Personal Information collected may include your name, nickname, email address, mobile phone number and birth date. We do not generally require this information to allow access to this website; however, there may be some areas of the site that you will not be able to access unless you register. For example, "Members Only" areas will require you to register before you can access them.

Nintendo also may collect demographic information from visitors, such as age, gender, geographic location, game genre interests, what platforms you own and stores you usually purchase Nintendo products from. This information helps us improve our online offerings and allows us to tailor information to your preferences.

Normally, Nintendo does not collect Sensitive Information (as defined in the Act). If Nintendo does collect Sensitive Information, it will only do so as specifically permitted by NPP 10.1.

##  What happens to the Personal Information collected?

The Personal Information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, Nintendo is approached by companies and organisations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may send out notices on behalf of these companies. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving.  You may opt out if you do not wish to receive such material.

We may use your Personal Information for internal demographic studies, so we can improve our websites and products to better meet our visitors' needs. In some cases, we may merge your Personal Information with data collected from other sources.

Nintendo occasionally uses outside agencies for market research, and may provide these companies with your Personal Information. These companies will be required to comply with Nintendo's privacy practices, the Act and the NPPs in handling this information.

Nintendo may also disclose Personal Information to other organisations with which Nintendo has a business relationship (including other companies within the Nintendo Group where such organisations have agreed to treat the Personal Information in accordance with the Act and the NPPs).
