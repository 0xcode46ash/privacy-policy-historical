# Nintendo World Report - Nintendo World Report Privacy Policy

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.

### What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol", or [IP address](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html). When a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within the Nintendo World Report, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Nintendo World Report Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement.

### Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?

We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

### What are cookies?

From time to time, Nintendo World Report or its advertisers may send a "[cookie](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/c/cookie.html)" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of Nintendo World Report you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. We and our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our Site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

### How do you use single-pixel gifs?

Nintendo World Report and its advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. Nintendo World Report does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.

### What information do you collect when I register for something?

Nintendo World Report offers access to some services that are free but that require registration. We may use your registration contact information to send notification of Nintendo World Report products and services by e-mail. See the above information regarding information and outside third parties.

### What other information do you request?

We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters or announcement lists). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.

We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Nintendo World Report products and services. Except as stated above, Nintendo World Report will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive.

When you sign up for the Nintendo World Report Forums, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the Nintendo World Report in any way.

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

### What information do you collect when I purchase something?

If you are purchasing something from Nintendo World Report, we need to know your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services.

### Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?

Nintendo World Report will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  1. Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Nintendo World Report,
  2. Protect and defend the rights or property of Nintendo World Report Network of Sites and related properties, or visitors to the Nintendo World Report Network of Sites and related properties,
  3. Identify persons who may be violating the law, the Nintendo World Report legal notice and Web site User Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the Nintendo World Report Network or its related properties,
  4. Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.



Nintendo World Report uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.

### What else should I know about my privacy when online?

The Nintendo World Report Network of Web sites contains many hyperlinks to other Web sites. Nintendo World Report also contains advertisements of third parties. Nintendo World Report is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or advertisers. Nintendo World Report does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Nintendo World Report with the Web sites to which Nintendo World Report links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Nintendo World Report may share aggregate data with such Web sites (such as how many people use our Site).

Please check with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
