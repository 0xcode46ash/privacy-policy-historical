# Nitro PDF Professional Online Store: Refund policy and conditions

At BinaryThing we are committed to ensuring the privacy of your personal information. We understand that privacy of your personal information is important. As part of our commitment to good privacy practice we have adopted the Australian National Privacy Principles prescribed by the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988. Our Privacy Policy tells you how we collect, use, distribute and protect personal information.

### Information we collect

* * *

The types of information we collect and handle normally comprises:  


  * Identity and contact details 
  * Product & service preferences 



Normally, we collect your personal information from you but on occasions we may obtain information about you from others. 

We only collect information which is necessary for the purposes of your dealings with us. We do not collect information about anyone's political or religious beliefs, ethnic background, criminal history or sexual preferences.

### Purpose of collection & use of personal information

* * *

The purpose for which we collect this information is to assist us in providing you with the products and services you have requested. We will not use your personal information for any purpose which is not related to the products or services you have requested or for any purpose which you would not reasonably expect us to use the information.

We will not disclose information about you to anyone else unless the disclosure:

  * is required by law; or 
  * is authorised by law (for example to protect our interest or where we have a duty to the public to disclose that information); or 
  * has been consented to by you. 



### Quality & correction

* * *

As the information we hold about you is important to decisions we make about the products and services which we provide to you, we strive to ensure that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist us, you should let us know if you find that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date. We will use all reasonable efforts to correct the information.

### Access

* * *

You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you at any time. Generally we will be able to provide you with such access. However, where: 

  * the access impacts on the privacy of others; 
  * the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; 
  * there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings 
  * such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or 
  * where the information is evaluative. 



We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why. We may also charge a fee to cover our reasonable costs associated with your request.

### Personal information security

* * *

We will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration. This includes both physical and technological security measures.

### Website

* * *

We only collect personal information from our website if you submit details to us via email or forms on our website. The information collected is limited to your email address and the contents of any message you may send to us. Personal information collected from our website will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and it will not be added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose without your consent.

Our website uses two types of cookies:
