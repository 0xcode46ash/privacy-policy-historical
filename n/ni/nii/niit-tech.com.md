NIIT Technologies has created privacy policies in order to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, addresses including an e-mail address or other contact details. In general, you can visit NIIT Technologies' web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

2\. NIIT Technologies' Principles to protect Privacy

In order to protect your privacy, NIIT Technologies has adopted the following principles  
a) Security  
b) Choice  
c) Notice  
d) Access/Accuracy

**(a) Security**  
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NIIT Technologies, the company intends to take reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

**(b) Choice**  
You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to NIIT Technologies. The notice NIIT Technologies intends to provide at the point where it collects Personal Information on the Site, should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of NIIT Technologies' Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. If you chose to have a relationship with NIIT Technologies, such as a contractual or other business relationship, NIIT Technologies will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

**(c) Notice**  
Where NIIT Technologies collects Personal Information on the Site, NIIT Technologies intends to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether NIIT Technologies plans to share such Personal Information outside of NIIT Technologies or with those working on NIIT Technologies' behalf. Unless the transfer of Personal Information is legally required, NIIT Technologies does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your permission to third parties who are not bound to act on NIIT Technologies' behalf.

**(d) Access/Accuracy**  
To the extent that you do provide NIIT Technologies with Personal Information, NIIT Technologies wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where NIIT Technologies collects Personal Information from you on the Site, its aim is to provide a means of contacting NIIT Technologies should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to [privacy@NIIT.com ](mailto:privacy@NIIT.com) and NIIT Technologies will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes.

Your Consent

By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of NIIT Technologies' Privacy Policy and to NIIT Technologies' processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above. There are times, however, when NIIT Technologies may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, NIIT Technologies will try (but is not obligated) to let you know at the time of collection, how it will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information NIIT Technologies collects is used only by it to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. Occasionally, NIIT Technologies may make the e-mail addresses, of those who provide information, available to other reputable organizations whose products or services it thinks you may find interesting. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access to your information. In case NIIT Technologies does not receive any response from you to limit the access of your information, it shall be deemed that you consent to such distribution of your Personal Information as mentioned above.

Questions or Suggestions

If you have any questions about NIIT Technologies Privacy Policy, collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information, please e-mail us at [privacy@NIIT.com ](mailto:privacy@NIIT.com) .

NIIT Technologies reserves its right to change, modify or update this privacy statement at any time without notice.
