If you request to receive Communications via your mobile phone, we request your mobile phone number and will use it to send Communications to you via SMS. 

If you request to receive geographically-specific Communications (e.g., those related to a specific neighborhood, county, city or state), we request your address or closest cross street to enable Organizations posting messages to the Web Site or sending Communications to Recipients to better understand who is benefitting from those services. 

Nixle uses your Personal Information to respond to your requests, deliver the Services you request, and notify you of updates or other items related to the Services.  We may use Personal Information to communicate with you in general, to notify you about offers and products or services available from us or our business partners that may be of interest to you, to solicit information from you and to enforce the [User TOS](http://www.nixle.com/termsofservice.html).

**If you are a registered User of the Web Site, all Personal Information we have collected about you is displayed in your User Profile. You can correct any errors in this information, or delete or modify this information, through the User Profile.**

**Cookies.** Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. Cookies are widely used, and most web browsers are configured initially to accept cookies automatically. Regardless of whether you are a registered user of the Web Site, Nixle attempts to install cookies when a user arrives at our Web Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Some of these cookies are a type called “persistent cookies,” that remain in your computer’s memory and identify you whenever you visit our Web Site.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Profile Information.** We and our business partners may use a combination of information we collect based on your usage of the Web Site and the Services in combination with information collected by and provided to us by third parties to identify content, products or opportunities we believe may be interesting to a Web Site user whose usage falls into a given profile of use. This is commonly known as “behavioral profiling.”

**Server Statistics.** We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Web Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Web Site, page views, and navigational patterns. This information is collected regardless of whether you are a registered User of our Web Site. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our Users. It helps us track “where” our Users are coming from and “where” they go either within or from our Web Site. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our Users.

In connection with an SMS tip submission, Nixle will store your number to allow for two-way communication and if you are a Nixle subscriber, a name will be associated with that number, however, your name and phone number will not be displayed to enforcement agencies or other third parties. In addition, Nixle uses industry standard encryption and other safeguards to provide security and anonymity of the information being submitted. Although such encryption and safeguards will be utilized, due to the nature of the internet and mobile SMS delivery networks, Nixle does not guarantee 100% security or timely delivery or reception of the information you submit. Neither Nixle nor any third party makes any guarantee as to if, how or when any information you submit may be acted upon by law enforcement agencies or public safety officials. In addition, Nixle cannot guarantee how often any such agency or official will review and monitor submitted tips. Under no circumstances should you rely on the anonymous tip service to report issues of an emergency nature or for conditions requiring an immediate response. If your issue is an emergency, please use the telephone and dial 911.
