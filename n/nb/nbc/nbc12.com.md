# NBC12 | WWBT Privacy Policy

This document describes NBC12's policy regarding information received about you during visits to our web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site. 

**Normal Web Site Usage**  
You can visit NBC12's web site to read information or use our online tools without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal web site usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal web site usage we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number or social security number. 

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**  
There are instances where NBC12 requests personally identifiable information to provide our web site visitor a service or correspondence (promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by NBC12 and is used to fulfill your request. If you tell us that the information should not be used as a basis for further contact, we will respect your request. The information you provide is used by NBC12 to improve the services we provide you. It is never provided to any other company for that company's independent use. 

**Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet**  
NBC12 joins the industry in recognizing that children, including young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal information requested online. Accordingly, NBC12 does not knowingly target children or teenagers (younger than eighteen years of age) for collection of information online. NBC12 does not solicit or collect customer identifiable information targeted at children and teenagers under eighteen and does not allow anyone else to do so on our web site. NBC12 encourages parents to take an active role in protecting the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of information about their children. NBC12 also supports the development of technologies that help parents to control the collection and use of personal information from children who use online services in their households. 

**Electronic Mail Sent to us that Contains Personal Information**  
Internet users may decide to send NBC12 personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing information about yourself. NBC12 will only use this information to identify the user as a NBC12 customer and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information other than to resolve the matter identified in the email. 

If you have provided us with your e-mail address so that we may include you in our newsletter or other mailing lists, we will place your email on those lists. We will provide a quick and effective method of removing yourself from the list quickly. 

**Cookies and Your Privacy**   
A web site may use cookies to simulate a continuous connection to that site. This makes it more convenient for users to visit pages within a site without having to reintroduce themselves with each mouse click. Cookies contain only information that users volunteer, and do not have the capability of infiltrating a user's hard drive or taking away personal information. The simple function of a cookie is that of helping the user navigate a web site with as little obstruction as possible. Most current browser versions offer users the following options relating to cookies: accept all cookies, accept only cookies that get sent back to the originating server, disable cookies. Another option is for your browser to warn you before accepting a cookie. Every time there is an incoming cookie, a dialog box will ask if you want to accept it. Please consult the user manual or the online Help manual of your browser for instructions on how to customize your browser with your cookie preferences. 

NBC12 uses cookies on only a few pages where you are asked to login or register and we only use it to remember your login/registration. We reserve the right to expand our use of this technology at any time and to modify our Privacy Policy as related. 

**Changes**  
We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy. A revised Privacy Policy will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue our web site and this Policy at any time.
