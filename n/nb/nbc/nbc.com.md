# NBC.com/Footer/Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

**NBC.com's Privacy Policy**  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of NBC.com and other NBC sites, we gather certain types of information about NBC.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information. 

**Information Collected By NBC.com**  
NBC.com collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on NBC.com, for example how many users log into NBC.com on a daily basis). 

**Personal Data**  
Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to NBC.com, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, in answering surveys, purchasing items from NBC.com, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by NBC.com. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas. 

**Aggregated Information**  
Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, NBC.com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from NBC.com, our servers log your IP address. NBC.com does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. NBC.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on NBC.com. 

**Use of Cookies**  
NBC.com also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow NBC.com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by NBC.com to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. NBC.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), NBC.com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. NBC.com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to NBC.com's privacy policies.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

**Use of Information Collected by NBC.com**  
NBC.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

NBC shares aggregated information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes. NBC may also share personal information with prescreened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. NBC will try to provide users with an opportunity to decline this service when such information is requested from you online.

NBC may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if NBC believes that any user has committed unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, NBC.com may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

In addition, in the event NBC plans to post any personal information on the Site, NBC will either notify you of this possibility when you provide the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted.

Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example a contest winner) on one of our sites. NBC will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted.

NBC may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites and to other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, NBC may share Web site usage information about visitors to our sites with such company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our sites through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).

If you object to the use of personal information provided by you for any reason, you may stop that use by modifying your registration information online. If you have registered as a member through our online registration system and have subscribed to STUDIO PASS, and you no longer wish to receive STUDIO PASS, please discontinue your subscriptions by going to: <http://www.nbc.com/registration>, and either (i) unchecking the relevant box or boxes, and then clicking "submit" or (ii) following any other relevant instructions on that page. If you have subscribed to another service or newsletter from NBC or NBCi and do not wish to receive that service or newsletter, please discontinue your subscription or registration by going to: <http://www.nbc.com/registration>, and either (i) unchecking the relevant box or boxes, and then clicking "submit" or (ii) following any other relevant instructions on that page. 

**Children and Privacy**  
NBC encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. At various places on NBC.com, NBC will ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 13, for example when requesting personal information from users, or NBC may ask for parental consent. However, while NBC requests this information or permission, NBC relies on users to be truthful in responding to these questions. 

_Individuals Under 13_

No information should be submitted to or posted on the Site by users under the age of 13 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. NBC.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless disclosed during collection. Users under the age of 13 are generally asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.

 _Individuals 13 Through 17_

NBC.com requests that children under the age of 18 do not submit or post information to the Site without a parent or guardian's consent. NBC.com may collect information, including personally identifying information, from users between the ages of 13 and 17, and with the permission of their parent or guardian this information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by NBC.com and may be shared with prescreened third parties. If a user or their parent or guardian changes their mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online as described above in "Use of Information Collected by NBC.com". 

**Message Boards and Chat**  
Please remember that information posted to message boards and chat areas becomes public information. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message boards. As set forth in NBC.com's Terms and Conditions of use, users of chat rooms and message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
It is important to note that NBC.com contains links to sites other than NBC.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as NBC.com. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on NBC.com, this will take you away from NBC.com and to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use NBC.com's logo and or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that NBC.com would not.

The use of any information or materials that you may access at these external sites is purely voluntary. You should not rely on their contents without independent and thorough review of the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, timeliness and correct sequencing. These external sites may also refer to specific commercial products, processes, or services by trade name, trademark, service mark, manufacturer or otherwise. Unless NBC has provided specific authority, such references in no way indicate our endorsement, recommendation or preference. This section should be read in conjunction with the full Terms of Service, below. 

**Additional Information**  
No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of NBC to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, NBC cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. 

Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall NBC be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of information or materials on our sites, even if NBC or an authorized representative of NBC, has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This section also should be read in conjunction with the full Terms of Service. 

**USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY.**

NBC reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a revised privacy policy. You can send e-mail to us with any further questions at [Webmaster@nbc.com](mailto:Webmaster@nbc.com).
