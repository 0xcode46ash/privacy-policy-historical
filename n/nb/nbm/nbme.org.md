# NBME Privacy Policy

The National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) is committed to protecting your privacy and to maintaining the integrity and privacy of personal information that NBME collects through its website. 

## **General Users**

NBME does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website.  Users to the public area of the www.NBME.org website may browse anonymously.  NBME’s web servers may track the IP addresses of visitors to the site to measure number of visits to the website.  If you participate in NBME’s examination services (e.g., NBME Licensing Examination Services, NBME Self-Assessment Services), you will be required to provide personal information during the registration process.

## **Participants for NBME Licensing Examination Services**

The following Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains NBME’s information collection and dissemination practices in connection with the [NBME® Licensing Examination Services](http://examinee.nbme.org/interactive) website (the “Site”).  Please review the Policy and feel free to contact us at [webmail@nbme.org](mailto:webmail@nbme.org) if you have any questions.  If we change our Policy, we will post any changes on this webpage so that you are always aware of the information that we collect and how we use it.

**1.**   **Collection of and Consent to Use Personal Information from Site Users**  
While visiting our Site, you may provide personal information to us in the process of completing various forms for the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) and NBME programs and services for students and graduates of medical schools in the United States and Canada.  Personal information may include, but is not limited to:

  * Name
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Mailing address
  * Telephone number
  * Credit card and billing information
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Citizenship
  * Gender 
  * Medical school history 



In general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on our USMLE application forms.  You, however, are not required to provide information regarding your ethnicity or first language.  Providing this information is optional and does not affect the outcome of your application.  NBME uses information about the ethnicity and first language of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential.   

By providing your personal information online, you consent to allow NBME to use that information in accordance with this Policy.  This information is used for identification purposes. 

**2.   Security**  
The security of your personal information is of the utmost concern to NBME.  We have administrative, technical and physical measures in place to protect the security of your personal information.  To protect your privacy, the NBME utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent third parties from seeing your personal information during data transmission. 

The Site requires a username and password to confirm your identity.  To access your personal information, you must first confirm your identity by entering your USMLE identification number and a password.  This authentication page is secured by SSL technology.

When you prepare to pay for services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information.  NBME uses a third-party vendor, VeriSign, to process your online payments.  Please see VeriSign’s Privacy Policy at <https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/helpscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside>.  NBME uses digital certificates through VeriSign.  As a VeriSign Secure Site, visitors can verify the site’s authenticity and communicate with NBME securely using 128 bit encryption that protects confidential information.

Please note that pages other than the authentication page and payment page are not secured by SSL or other encryption programs. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  In the event there is a breach of the security measures used by NBME, NBME will take reasonable and appropriate actions to minimize the damage resulting from the security breach.  However, NBME cannot guarantee that unauthorized individuals will not obtain access to NBME systems through illegal measures, despite our security measures.

If, for any reason, you should choose not to provide your personal information online, you may request a paper version of the application or document request form by calling 215-590-9700 or by email to [webmail@nbme.org](mailto:webmail@nbme.org).

**3.   Cookies**   
Cookies are small text files that a web server can store on a user’s hard disk.  When you access any of the online services at the Site, NBME uses temporary session cookies placed on your web browser which enables NBME to identify you.   The temporary session cookies are deleted once the browser is closed.

**4.   Credit Card**   
All credit card transactions are processed through a vendor via SSL.  NBME submits the requisite information to the appropriate clearinghouse to verify and validate the credit card.  NBME does not disclose credit card information for any other purpose.

**5.   Use of Personal Information Collected**   
NBME uses the personal information you provide to process your applications and requests for services, and to verify that you meet the minimum qualifications for our programs and services.  Additionally, NBME may use aggregated personal information for research and statistical purposes.  NBME does not use your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes.

**6.   Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties**   
We disclose your personal information to certain third parties to provide the products and services you have requested online.  To support these services, we send a portion of your personal information, such as name and USMLE ID, to them using secured protocols and encryption.  They have access to the minimal information needed to perform their functions, but otherwise will not use the information for other purposes.  For example, when you apply for a USMLE examination, we will provide certain registration information to companies that schedule and administer the test. 

NBME uses a third-party vendor, VeriSign, to process your online payment transactions.  To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 2 above. You may review VeriSign’s Privacy Policy at <https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/helpscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside>.

The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB).  To ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us are retained in a database shared by the NBME and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling.  Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate. 

NBME also shares certain user information with the Association of American Medical Colleges (the “AAMC”).  This organization uses the data that we provide for research purposes only.  

Other than as noted in this Policy, or as NBME shall notify user in the future, NBME does not to sell, rent, share, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information, and other personal information that you voluntarily provide to NBME, to any organization or individual without a legitimate interest (collectively “Third Parties”), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of NBME.

**7.   Access and Ability to Correct Personal Data**  
Using the Site, you may access and verify or change such personal information as mailing and e-mail addresses and telephone number.  You may also submit a name change request.  The submission of a name change request will generate further instructions regarding how to complete the request.  NBME must receive appropriate documentation before we will make such a name change.  You may also check the status of your USMLE applications, Scheduling Permits, score reports, and document requests.  To do so, you must have both your USMLE Identification Number and a password.  If you do not have your password, you may obtain one by accessing the Site and following the instructions for logging in.  The Site is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with the exception of maintenance periods.

Upon written request accompanied by appropriate documentation, NBME will change your social security number or birth date. To request such a change to your personal information, you may write to us at the address listed in Section 12, “Inquiries and Concerns,” below.

**8.   Links to and from NBME**   
For your convenience, this Site may contain links to other Internet web sites.  However, NBME does not endorse, and is not responsible for, the privacy practices or the content of these web sites.

**9.   Children’s Privacy**   
This Site is not designed to attract children.  Accordingly, we do not intend to collect personal information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.

**10.   Limitation of Liability**   
Neither the NBME nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliate entities, agents, employees, or subcontractors will be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits (even if we are advised of the possibility) arising in any way from the information contained in this Site or any information transmitted via this Site.  The NBME is not liable for any damages or losses that may be caused to any equipment and other software due to any viruses, defects or malfunctions in connection with access or use of this Site.
