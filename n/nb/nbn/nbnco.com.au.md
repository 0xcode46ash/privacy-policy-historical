# Privacy Policy - NBN Co Limited

### Personal Information

This Privacy Policy concerns any personal information or sensitive information of yours which is provided to us.

Personal information is any information about you where your identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information.

Sensitive information is any personal information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record or health. We generally do not wish to be informed of a person’s sensitive information. We, in any event, will only collect, use or disclose sensitive information about you as allowed by law, for example, where we have received your consent to do so or the collection is required by law.

### Passive information collection

As you navigate through this website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) through various technologies, such as cookies, internet tags or web beacons and navigational data collection.

This website may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better services to website visitors, customise the website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the website for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the website unless you have consented.

### How we collect your personal information

We may collect your personal information in a number of ways, including:

  * directly from you, when you provide it to us or our agents or contractors;
