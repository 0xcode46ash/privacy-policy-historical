The information which can be shared includes account history and customer experience. In addition, although we are permitted under the FCRA to share non-experience credit information (e.g., credit report information obtained from a credit bureau) with our affiliates, consumers must be informed of this information sharing and provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out of such sharing.

In situations where an affiliate of the company plans to share non-experience credit information with another affiliate, National Bank will honor your request not to share this information. It is important to remember that a FCRA request to not share applies to certain information about your applications with us, such as your account number, and information about your credit report or similar information obtained from credit bureaus and other sources outside National Bank.
