# Privacy policy | New Zealand Trade and Enterprise

This Privacy Policy applies to all New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's websites (each a Site and, together, the Sites).

These terms should be read in conjunction with the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-of-use/ "Terms of use").

  1. Collection: New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) may gather two types of information about you from the Sites: (a) personal information, provided by you when you submit that information on a Site as prompted, for example, at the time of posting a blog or of voluntary registration for the services NZTE offers; and (b) aggregate information generated by NZTE's systems, which tracks traffic to and on the Sites but does not identify you personally. Failure to provide necessary personal information when requested may result in certain services or parts of the Sites not being available to you.
  2. Disclosure of information: NZTE may disclose: (a) any information that NZTE gathers about you to third parties for the purposes of providing you with services that NZTE considers may be of interest to you; (b) aggregate tracking information and other information that does not personally identify you, to third parties; (c) your personal information to third parties, when NZTE believes in good faith that NZTE is required to do so by law; (d) your personal information to other third parties, provided NZTE has your prior authorisation, which NZTE will usually obtain at the time of collecting the information from you.
  3. Use: NZTE may use the personal information it collects: (a) to verify your identity and assist you if you forget your password or login details for any of NZTE's registration services; (b) to assist in providing the services requested by you; (c) to provide further information to you about other websites and services or which NZTE considers may be of interest to you; (d) for sharing with third parties that have similar objectives (in whole or in part) to NZTE where the sharing is for a not-for-profit purpose; (e) for future marketing, promotional and publicity purposes that relate to NZTE or its purpose, including to carry out direct marketing, market research and surveys; (f) to help ensure that you are shown information that NZTE considers may be relevant to you and your interests; and (g) for any other use that you authorise.
