# Privacy Policy – NTEN

NTEN is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and website users. This policy explains what types of information is collected by NTEN’s websites, including but not limited to nten.org, community.nten.org, local.nten.org, ntc.nten.org, jobs.nten.org, the Nonprofit Technology Conference mobile app, and the NTEN Stories mobile app, and explains how that information is used. No data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

## **What information do we collect?**

_Information you provide_

Those who create an account on an NTEN website, sign up to receive NTEN electronic newsletters, or register for events, voluntarily provide us with contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information for specific, limited purposes that are outlined below. You may opt out, either now or at any time in the future, if you do not wish to receive our messages.

_IP addresses_

NTEN uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer websites, tailor content to your location, and for metrics used to track website visitor traffic.

_Cookies_

NTEN websites and apps use cookies to automatically help provide better services. They remind us who you are and your preferences for our website based on what you’ve done and told us before. The cookie is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our website. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you’re particularly interested in, and we use them to serve you ads in other networks. They also let us track your usage of our sites, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or cancel them by instructing your web browser accordingly.

## **How do we use this information?**

_Member Directory_

NTEN maintains a directory for the purpose of helping members of our community connect with one another. When you become a member or sign up for an online community profile at an NTEN website, your name, organization, mailing address, phone, and email address are added to our Member Directory. You can change which information is shown to members and the public by changing the privacy settings in your profile.

_Nonprofit Technology Conference_

The names of all registrants to the Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC) will be listed in the NTC mobile app. Attendees are able to manage or opt out of this listing.

_Email Communications_

We publish several electronic newsletters on a monthly basis, including Connect and Member News. We also send announcements about NTEN events and services to our community.

NTEN does not provide, sell, or rent email addresses to anyone outside the organization for any price at any time, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event, or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner. We also provide the opportunity for community members to opt-in for communications from vendors and conference exhibitors.

## **Security**

_SSL Encryption_

Information flowing between our sites, its API providers and its users is secured by industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. We encrypt all traffic to our sites, including anything you submit through your nten.org user profile, all purchases through our cart, and all single sign-on requests to our community.nten.org discussion forums and our Adobe-based learning management system.

_External Links_

Our sites include links to external websites. These links do not fall under any of our domains, and therefore NTEN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. Your use of any linked website is solely at your own risk.

## **Your responsibility to protect privacy**

By using NTEN websites and apps, you agree to protect the privacy of others by keeping their information private. For example, do not share email addresses and phone numbers listed in the Member Directory, which you have access to as a member benefit.

## **Modifications**

We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page; please review it periodically. Your continued use of our websites will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.

## Contact us

If you have any concern about privacy at nten.org or any of our websites, please send us a description of your concern and we will try to resolve it.
