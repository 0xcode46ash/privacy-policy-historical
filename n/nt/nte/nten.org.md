  * Who collects such information;
  * How such information is used;
  * With whom your information may be shared;

**What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information:**  
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, e-mail address, address, interests, and similar information. We do not store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers.

**Internet Protocol Address:**  
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Security:**  
All information provided to N-TEN is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of N-TEN. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

**Other Web Sites:**  
Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site for which N-TEN has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.

**Member Directory:**  
N-TEN maintains a member directory for the purpose of helping members of our community connect with one another. If you are a current N-TEN member, other current N-TEN members have access to the complete directory which includes your name, organization, mailing address, phone, fax, and email address. If you do not want to be included in the member directory, you may email [holly@nten.org](mailto:holly@nten.org) and ask to be removed.

**Conference Privacy:**  
Registrants will be included in the list of conference attendees that will be distributed to conference attendees in a hard copy format. The purpose of this list is to encourage networking and individual follow up. This list is not to be used for unsolicited commercial or bulk-email purposes. The information on the list will be limited to name, title, organization, address, phone, fax, email, city, and state. If you wish not to be included in this list, email [](mailto:holly@nten.org)[holly@nten.org](mailto:holly@nten.org).

If you choose to opt-in during registration, your information will also be shared with conference sponsors and/or exhibitors upon request in soft-copy format for a limited, one-time email and one-time snail mailing prior to and after the conference. Please report any violations of this one-time use policy to [holly@nten.org](mailto:holly@nten.org).

**Contacting N-TEN:**  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, you can contact: [](mailto:holly@nten.org)[holly@nten.org](mailto:holly@nten.org)
