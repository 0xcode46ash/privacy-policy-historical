# Privacy Policy – NTEN

The Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN) is committed to protecting the privacy of our members and website users. This policy explains what types of information is collected by NTEN’s websites, including but not limited to nten.org, community.nten.org, ntc.nten.org, benchmarks.nten.org, and the Nonprofit Technology Conference mobile app, and explains how that information is used. No data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

## What Information Do We Collect?

_Information you provide_

Those who create an account on an NTEN website, sign up to receive NTEN electronic newsletters, or register for events voluntarily provide us with contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information for specific, limited purposes that are outlined below. You may opt out, either now or at any time in the future, if you do not wish to receive our messages.

_IP addresses_

NTEN uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer websites, tailor content to your location, and for statistical metrics used to track website visitor traffic.

_Cookies_

NTEN websites and apps use “cookies” to automatically help provide better services. They remind us who you are and your preferences for our website based on what you’ve done and told us before. The cookie is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our website. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you’re particularly interested in. They also let us track your usage of nten.org, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or cancel them by instructing your web browser accordingly.

## How Do We Use This Information?

_Member Directory_

NTEN maintains a directory for the purpose of helping members of our community connect with one another. When you become a member or sign up for an online community profile at an NTEN website, your name, organization, mailing address, phone, fax, and email address are added to our Member Directory. You can change which information is shown to members and the public by changing the privacy settings in your profile.

_Nonprofit Technology Conference_

The names of all registrants to the Nonprofit Technology Conference (NTC) will be listed in the NTC mobile app.

_Email Communications_

We publish several electronic newsletters on a monthly basis, including Connect and Member News. We also send announcements about NTEN events and products to our community.

NTEN does not provide, sell, or rent email addresses to anyone outside the organization to anyone for any price at any time, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event, or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner. We also provide the opportunity for community members to opt-in for communications from vendors and conference exhibitors.

## Security

_SSL Encryption_

Some information provided to NTEN is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven system that lets your browser automatically encrypt data before you send it to us. Currently, we encrypt all traffic for jobs.nten.org using SSL and will soon encrypt all user profile sections of nten.org and community.nten.org

_External Links_

nten.org includes links to external websites. These links do not fall under the nten.org domain, and therefore NTEN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of external websites. Your use of any linked website is solely at your own risk.

## Your Responsibility to Protect Privacy

By using NTEN websites and apps, you agree to protect the privacy of others by keeping their information private. For example, do not share email addresses and phone numbers listed in the Member Directory, which you have access to as a member benefit.

## Modifications

We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page; please review it periodically. Your continued use of our websites will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.

## Contact Us

If you have any concern about privacy at nten.org or any of our websites, please send us a description of your concern and we will try to resolve it.
