# Privacy Policy - New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD TV)

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**NTD Television (NTDTV)** is committed to protecting the privacy rights of its donors, viewers and visitors to our websites. We have prepared this "Privacy Policy" so that you know what type of information are collected from our websites, how and when those information are collected, how that information may be used, and how that information is protected.   

**I.   WHICH SITES ARE COVERED BY THIS POLICY?**  
This Privacy Policy applies to ntdtv.org, ntdtv.com, shows.ntdtv.com. ticket.ntdtv.com, and dance.ntdtv.com (collectively, the "Sites") owned and operated by NTDTV.  Please note that our Site may contain links to sponsor organizations and NTDTV affiliate stations.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.  We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any organization before submitting your personal information to them.

**II.   WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?**  
NTDTV collects two types of information from visitors to the Site:  (A) Personally Identifiable Information, and (B) Non-personally Identifiable Information (information such as IP Addresses and cookies, which allow for a better use of the Site). Uses of this information are discussed in Section III.

**A.**    **Personally Identifiable Information**  
Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card information. NTDTV does not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis upon request, in the following situations:

NTDTV collects Personal Information through its donation subscriptions, pledges of financial support, and/or services which require subscriptions such as an email or postal newsletter ("Subscription Activities"). Your Personal Information may be collected and used by NTDTV as is reasonably necessary to complete a transaction you requested (e.g., credit card information to process your donation). NTDTV also collects Personal Information directly from you, and others authorized by you to share your Personal Information with NTDTV. NTDTV may offer various correspondence in connection with its Subscription Activities (e.g., newsletters, postings or other communications) in order to inform its donors, viewers and NTDTV Site visitors about promotions, special offers, events, changes or postings to the NTDTV Sites.

**B.**    **Non-personally Identifiable Information**  
In addition to information that you provide to us, we may also collect and store certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when using the Site.  This information helps us improve the experience you and other visitors have with the Site.

For example, we may collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain, as well as related information such as the date on which you visit the Site.   This information does not identify you personally and is only used in the aggregate.  

As is common practice among web sites, we use “cookies” and similar technologies.  Cookies are text files which store your preferences.  No personal information is ever stored in a NTDTV cookie, even if you have entered your name or email address on other parts of the Site. 

You can generally prevent cookies from being used by changing the settings in your web browser, but please be aware that by doing so you may be unable to fully utilize the Site. 

We sometimes allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/).

**III.   HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION GATHERED ON THE SITE?**

**• General Uses**

NTDTV may use your Personal Information in the following ways: (1) to respond to your requests for information; (2) to process your purchase requests; (3) to provide you with communications, newsletters, emails and other information as authorized by you, as requested by you, or as part of your participation in a subscription based service provided by NTDTV; (4) for contest management; (5) for editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; (6) to send marketing and promotional communications from NTDTV; (7) for informational notices about NTDTV; (8) for purposes included in this Privacy Policy; (9) for any other use specified at the time the Personal Information is collected; and (10) for purposes that are new or outside the scope of this Privacy Policy but only after obtaining your prior consent. NTDTV may also use portions of Personal Information in a manner that is unlikely to directly reveal your identity. For example, if NTDTV wants to publicly use a quote from an email or online comment from you, we may give attribution to the quote by using your initials or first name with the city and state in which you reside. You may opt-out of future services or information at anytime by contacting feedback[at]ntdtv.com*.

**• Creation and Use of Aggregate Information**

We may use your Personal Information and other information about or provided by you to create "Aggregated Information". Aggregated Information is created by aggregating or generating statistical data from Personal Information about donors, viewers and NTDTV Site users. Aggregated Information also is anonymous data, because it cannot be used to identify a particular individual. We may use Aggregate Information for marketing, share it with our sponsors, business associates, or other affiliated companies, to better understand visitors to the NTDTV Sites and our members, and to improve NTDTV services such as the NTDTV Sites.

**IV. May My Personal Information Be Disclosed to Others?**

NTDTV takes reasonable steps to restrict access to the Personal Information that we collect from donors, viewers and website visitors, but NTDTV may provide access as follows: (i) to those who may use the Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, any other applicable agreement between you and NTDTV, or with your prior consent; (ii) to provide you with customer service; (iii) to protect the rights, property and safety of NTDTV, its subsidiaries, affiliate, business associates or partners, donors, viewers and website visitors or others; (iv) to parties engaged by NTDTV to process information to fulfill purposes authorized by you (e.g., processing of your credit card payment for donation).

Further, NTDTV may also disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law, or if NTDTV believes that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant or a law enforcement request, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NTDTV Site or other NTDTV content, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of NTDTV and NTDTV subsidiaries, affiliates, business associates or partners, members, donors, viewers and website visitors, the public or NTDTV and its employees.

The NTDTV Sites may contain links, which, if you choose to click, will lead you to websites controlled by third parties. NTDTV is not responsible or liable for the actions of these third parties, including how they process personal information or for the content posted on their websites.

**V. Are Online Financial Transactions Secure?**

NTDTV offers you the convenience of making on-line donations via credit card. NTDTV uses reasonable precautions to keep this and other Personal Information disclosed to us secure. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure correct usage of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Nonetheless, NTDTV does not guarantee the security, accuracy or completeness of any such procedures. You should be aware that third parties might unlawfully intercept transmissions of Personal Information or misuse or abuse the Personal Information that we collect from you.

**VI. Modifications To Our Privacy Policy**
