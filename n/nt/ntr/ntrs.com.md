# Consumer Privacy Principles

Consumer Privacy Notice

Privacy at Northern Trust - Keeping Your Finances a Private Matter

When it comes to your financial affairs, you expect a relationship built on privacy and integrity. You can trust Northern to meet and exceed these expectations. 

We respect the premium you place on keeping your personal finances a private matter. **That’s why Northern Trust does not sell client lists or any other client information to outside companies.**

Keeping Your Information Secure   
Northern Trust employees must uphold a high standard of conduct to maintain our clients’ privacy. Preserving your trust is one of our core values. In order to keep information confidential and appropriately protected, we have policies that limit access to your personal information to only those employees who need it to perform their jobs. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information. 

Collecting Information   
Northern works hard to collect information that helps us provide you with better service, better products, and a better financial relationship. The types of information we collect are: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications, other forms, through our web sites, and from conversations with you 
  * Information we receive from a third party with your permission 
  * Information about your transactions with us or our affiliates 
  * Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies 



We may disclose any of this information about our clients and former clients to unaffiliated third parties only under certain circumstances, and only as permitted by law. For instance, we share with companies that perform services for us, such as a company that mails your statements or performs marketing services for us. These companies are not allowed to use this information to sell their products to you directly, and they are not allowed to sell this information to other companies. We also may share with other affiliated and non-affiliated financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. Some of these companies may include Northern Funds and the institution that provides and services Northern Trust credit cards. 

In addition, we share the information we collect about our clients and former clients with our affiliated financial service providers — such as a Northern Trust Bank in another state and our securities broker-dealer, Northern Trust Securities, Inc. (NTSI). **We share this information so we can invite you to special events and inform you of products we think fit your needs**. 

Your Privacy Preferences   
You do have the right to restrict some of the information we disclose to our affiliates for marketing purposes. You may direct us not to share certain information about you, such as your assets, income, and date of birth by calling 1-866-260-9550, Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 7 PM Central Time; by writing to us at Northern Trust, P.O. Box 92929, Chicago, IL 60675; or by stopping in one of our locations. Please be sure to provide your full name, address, telephone number, and Social Security number. We will process your request within a reasonable period of time — please be aware that between the time you make the request and when it becomes effective, you still may receive marketing materials from an affiliate. 

If you have a joint account at Northern, we will assume your request to not share those pieces of information among our affiliates applies only to your information and not to the information of the other joint account holders, unless we are directed otherwise. If you contact us on behalf of a joint account holder who wants to restrict the information we share, please be prepared to provide the full name, address, telephone number, and Social Security number of the joint account holder as well. 

Please note that even if you ask us not to share certain information with our affiliates, we still may share that information for other reasons, such as to service your existing accounts. In addition, the Northern organization that originally collected the information still can use it for its own marketing decisions. 

Keeping You Informed   
While this privacy statement will be sent to you annually, you only need to notify us once if you choose to restrict how we share information. If our information-sharing practices change, we will send you a revised notice. You also can return to this page on our web site, to view the most current privacy notice. 

This privacy notice applies to all the Northern Trust affiliates listed below. If you have other relationships with Northern Trust or another affiliate, you may receive more than one privacy notice from Northern.
