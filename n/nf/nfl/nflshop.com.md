**Privacy Statement**

NFLSHOP.com believes in keeping your confidential information confidential. With this in mind, we have adopted the privacy policy described below, which addresses:

  
  
|  **Registration**  
We encourage you to register when shopping at the NFLSHOP.com site, however, it is not required. Our registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name, age range, password, a password hint, to help you if you can't remember your password during future visits to the Website, and e-mail address). **You must be 13 years of age or older to register**. Registration helps us to provide you with an easy and personalized shopping experience, with quick and simple checkout options. The customer contact information you supply on the registration form will be used to send you e-mail NFL Newsletters and updates about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. In addition, the information is used, when necessary, to contact you concerning the status of an order or to answer any of your questions.

At all times, you have the option of "opting out" of receiving future e-mail updates by visiting our [choice/opt-out form](https://web.archive.org/Templates/UM/RegisterCustomer/OptinOptOut.tem).

If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve our customers' shopping experience with us.

**Order Information**  
Customers use an order form to request information or products. When you place an order, we collect contact information, such as your shipping and e-mail addresses, and financial information, such as your account or credit card numbers. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about us to our customers and to get in touch with them when necessary. Financial information is used to bill the customer for products. You also have the option of ordering products over the telephone, and you may choose to pay by check.

If you register with our Website, we can store your credit card information on file on our secure servers for your use on future orders. If you select this option, you will be able to store multiple credit card information in "My Account". You will be shown the name you selected for your card, its last four digits, and the expiration date to confirm it is the card you want to use again. All other credit card information is masked, so even you will not see your credit card number again. When you select this payment option, your credit card information goes over a secured server.
