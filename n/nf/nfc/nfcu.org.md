                       WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?                  Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the
                       right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and
                       protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
 What?                 The types of personal information that we collect and share depend on the product or service that you
