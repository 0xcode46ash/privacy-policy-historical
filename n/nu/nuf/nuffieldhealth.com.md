# Privacy statement | Nuffield Health

Nuffield Health Privacy Policy updated on 24th May 2012

###### 1\. Recent Changes in European Legislation

In line with recent changes in European legislation, UK law now requires website operators to ask for a website user’s permission when placing certain kinds of cookie on their devices for the first time.

Where consent is required, the law states that it should be “informed consent”. This increases  
the onus on websites to ensure that visitors understand what cookies are and why website operators and others want to use them.

Here at Nuffield Health we are committed to providing the best digital service to our visitors whilst protecting their privacy, and are happy to share our position on the recent changes in Cookie law.

###### 1.2 What are Cookies?

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. 

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience.

They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

###### 1.3 Category 1 Cookies

These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.

User consent is not required for the delivery of those cookies which are strictly necessary to provide services requested by the user.

Nuffield Health collects these types of cookies

###### 1.4 Category 2 Cookies

These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.

Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. This category does not include cookies used for behavioural/ targeted advertising networks.

Nuffield Health collects these types of cookies by functional use in clause 2.1 . By using nuffieldhealth.com you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device

###### 1.5 Category 3 Cookies

These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

These cookies are used to remember customer selections that change the way the site behaves or looks. It might also include cookies that are used to deliver a specific function, but where that function includes cookies used for behavioural/targeted advertising networks they must be included in category 4 as well as this category.

Nuffield Health collects these types of cookies by functional use in clause 2.1 . By using nuffieldhealth.com you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device

* * *

###### 1.6 Category 4 Cookies

These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

Nuffield Health do not collect these cookies, and will endeavour to obtain clear and informed user consent depending on the purpose for which the category 4 cookies are to be used.
