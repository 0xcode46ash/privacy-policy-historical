|  Sharing information with third parties  
We compile, or aggregate, information collected from and about our members in a database. We share information in the aggregate with our partners and advertisers. No personally identifiable information is included.

We use a credit card-processing company to administer purchases made on the site, and a shipping company to fulfill orders for products other than those delivered online. We share your personal information with these partners to ensure that your purchases are fulfilled properly and in a timely manner. These partners do not use this information for any other purpose.  
  
|  Using cookies  
NursingCenter uses a technology called "cookies" to maintain information on your computer. A cookie is a small packet of information that you’ve shared with us. We use cookies to store your account information, fulfill and track your purchases and, ultimately, make it easier for you to use the site.

To take full advantage of the services NursingCenter provides, you must have cookies turned on. Consult your computer’s Help section to learn how to turn cookies on or off. Be assured that demographic information is shared only in the aggregate (not individual information) and that our partners are committed to using that information only to offer products and services that meet your needs.  
  
|  Gathering other data  
We use computer-specific addresses (called Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses) to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad, aggregate demographic information. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to tie your purchases to your user information. Your IP address also helps us analyze trends, diagnose problems with our servers, and administer our Web site.  
   
|  Links to other sites  
NursingCenter offers links to other sites as a service to its members. We select these sites carefully and strive to link only to reputable, professional resources. However, NursingCenter cannot control the content on sites not under its direct control, nor can it be held responsible for the content or services provided by third-party Web sites. Be sure to review the privacy policy of all third-party sites that you visit through NursingCenter.  
   
|  Content from third-parties  
NursingCenter uses an outside advertising company to display advertisements on our site. These advertisements may contain cookies. Although we use cookies in other parts of NursingCenter, cookies received with banner advertisements are collected by the advertising company. We have no access to this information, nor control over it.

The NursingCenter MarketPlace may feature products marketed and distributed to users by third-party vendors. These vendors are carefully screened by NursingCenter to provide the best possible shopping experience for our members. Nevertheless, NursingCenter assumes no responsibility for orders placed with these vendors, nor liability for their products, services, or fulfillment capabilities.
