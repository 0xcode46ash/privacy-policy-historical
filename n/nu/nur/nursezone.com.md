Although we may collect certain information from you as discussed below, please be reassured in knowing the following:  
  
**_Personal Information that You Give Us_**  
  
There are various areas on our site where we either require or permit you to transfer personal information voluntarily. We never divulge such information to third parties without your consent. These areas include:  
  
_E-commerce._ We do not offer merchandise for sale to our users online. However, we have recently developed relationships with a select group of high-quality online stores, and you may shop at these stores by using a link from our site to theirs. You should be aware that such third parties may request and record information about your purchases such as your address and credit card information. We cannot guarantee your privacy on such other Web sites and do not have control over their privacy policies or content. We urge you to review carefully the privacy policy of any such third party provider prior to making a purchase to determine how your personal information will be used. Your correspondence or business dealings with any third party providers, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such providers.  
  
_Registration for Continuing Education Courses._ We may host continuing education courses for our registered users online. Enrollment for such courses is completely optional and at your discretion. When you register for continuing education courses you will be required to provide billing information exactly as it appears on your credit card statement so that we can process your order including your name, address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date. The information you provide is used solely for the purpose of consummating your purchase. We may record information about registration for continuing education courses to determine which courses appeal most to members of our group. This statistical information may help us to improve our product offerings.  
  
In addition, we provide links to third party Web sites that offer continuing education courses on nursing and other health care related topics. Enrollment for such courses is completely optional and at your discretion. You should be aware that such third parties may request and record registration information about you. We cannot guarantee your privacy on such other Web sites and do not have control over their privacy policies or content. We urge you to review carefully the privacy policy of any such third party provider prior to registering for a continuing education course to determine how your personal information will be used. Your correspondence or business dealings with any third party providers, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such providers.  
  
_Career Center._ In order to use our career placement center, which includes recruitment and placement of nurses, we require that you be registered with our site. We ask you to provide us with your name, e-mail address, nursing specialty or discipline and some other general information. In connection with our career center services, we will offer you the opportunity to be contacted by one of our career advisors. Should you choose to be contacted, a career advisor will contact you via your e-mail address or telephone number on record. In addition, our Career Center contains a "Create A Résumé" program which enables our registered users to create and print résumés and post them on our site. Our site will enable the user to e-mail the résumé only to us at _NurseZone_. We may forward the résumé via e-mail or facsimile without the nurse's name, address or other personally identifiable information, to selected health care facilities only upon the prior request or consent of the nurse. In addition, each user who posts a résumé on our site will be assigned a unique URL number. Should a user provide the URL number to third parties other than _NurseZone_ , we cannot and do not guarantee your privacy. We urge you not to disclose your URL number to anyone.  
  
_Bulletin Board._ We offer a bulletin board that permits posting opportunities for our registered users. Please see our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20060418033321id_/http%3A//nursezone.com/terms.asp) before using the bulletin board. Also, Bulletin Board messages posted by users may be featured in NurseZone's weekly e-newsletter.   
  
_Correspondence._ You will be required to provide your e-mail address when you register for our weekly e-mail newsletter. The newsletter provides nurses with a variety of information on topics we believe would be of interest to you. Again, your name and e-mail address are not shared with any third parties. There may be other times when we request or acquire your e-mail address, such as when you send us an e-mail with questions or comments. We will use only your e-mail address to respond to e-mails from you, forward and send your e-mails to and from other registered users and internal _NurseZone_ employees who may be able to respond to you, send information to you concerning your account, and inform you of updates to our Web site. We do not share e-mail addresses or any other personal information about our registered users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors or other third parties except to provide services you have requested.  
  
_Special Contests and Promotions._ _NurseZone_ will occasionally feature a contest/promotion for nurses. In order to enter the contest/promotion, we require you to provide us with your name, phone number and e-mail address so that we can contact you if you win. We also ask for other information that will help us reach nurses with our extensive site offerings. Your information will only be shared with third parties if you request to receive information from the provider parties.  
  
_Application Form._ _NurseZone_ allows you to apply to its healthcare staffing partners by completing an online application form. Completion of this form is completely optional and at your discretion. Information that will be gathered by completing this form includes your name, address, age, social security number, dates available to travel, certification, licensure, education, employment history, legal history and eligibility to work in the United States. The information you provide is used solely for the purpose of assessing your suitability to work as a healthcare traveler and to match your expertise with available travel assignments.   
  
**_Information that We Independently Derive From Your Use of Our Site_**  
  
Aside from any information you may actively disclose to us, there is other, less obvious, information which we might obtain from you. We may use such information for internal purposes such as to improve the content of our Web pages.  
  
_Cookies._ A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are widely used on the Internet and have become an industry standard. Cookies enable user registration and login and personalization, among other things. On our site you are required to accept a cookie where you are prompted to log-in to use our Bulletin Board. We use the cookie to remind us of who you are. When you are logged into the Bulletin Board, the cookie permits you to click on to another site and return to the Bulletin Board without having to log-in again. Although a cookie cannot, in and of itself, identify you, it can identify your computer. Your browser is most likely set up to accept cookies automatically. If you would like to disable this feature you may do so by adjusting the options or preferences in your browser. However, by doing so, you will lose some of the convenience of our Web pages.  
  
_IP Addresses._ An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. Each time you log onto our site and each time you request one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Although we log your session with us, we will not normally link your IP address to anything that can enable us to identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, users or others.  
  
_Other Information._ _NurseZone_ may require other information for tracking or verifying compliance with our policies, abiding by federal, state and local laws and for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. If our information practices materially change at some time in the future, we will contact you or post such change to the site before we use your data for these new purposes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please periodically check our site, especially this privacy policy.  
  
**How to Change Your User Information**  
  
You may update information related to your account or contact us with questions by sending an e-mail to us at [contact@nursezone.com](mailto:contact@nursezone.com).  
  
**When We May Be Forced to Disclose**  
  
We may disclose user information in special cases when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property or the rights or property of our users or others. We also may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  
  
**Opting-Out**  
  
If at any time you object to our use of your personal information, including use of your e-mail address, you may stop that use by e-mail request to [contact@nursezone.com](mailto:contact@nursezone.com).  
  
**Links to Other Sites**  
  
Linking to other sites is an integral part of the functionality of the Internet and therefore of our site. Any link to a page which displays a URL of a non- _NurseZone_ site in the address window of your browser or which indicates that it is "powered by" an entity other than _NurseZone_ , is a link to a site outside of our service. This includes links to any advertisers and partners that may link to _NurseZone_ or are part of a co-branding or partnership agreement, as well as other suggested links or links our users may post. These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect data or solicit personal information. Please note that we cannot guarantee and are not responsible for the content of outside sites.  
  
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information on other Web sites that information can be collected and used by people you do not know. While we strive to protect our visitors' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information you disclose at other Web sites, and you do so at your own risk.  
  
**Security**  
  
The importance of security is a top priority for us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your Internet connection to our servers. We also take great care to protect user-information off-line. All of your data is handled only by authorized personnel and our database servers have a backup system to prevent loss of data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure and we will not be held liable should a third party illegally obtain your personal information. While we have made a great effort to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  
  
Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.  
  
**Your Acceptance of These Terms**  
  
By using this site, you signify your assent to the _NurseZone_ privacy policy and the terms of use. If you do not agree with this policy and these terms, please refrain from using our site. Notice of any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this site. Your continued use of the _NurseZone_ site following a reasonable notice of changes to our privacy policy or terms of use will mean you accept the changes.

NurseZone’s privacy policy is effective as of March 12, 2004.
