## INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Numerologist.com collects personal information such as name, time/date/place of birth, and e-mail address, when you knowingly provide it to us. In addition, Numerologist.com may collect other information provided by you, such as your credit card number and billing address, when you order online from us. Our Web servers automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as pages visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies). We use these statistics to monitor our site's performance and to make it easier for you to use. 

We respect each site visitor's right to personal privacy. To that end, we collect and use information throughout our website only as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. This statement applies solely to information collected on this website. 

### Information collected when visiting our sites

When ever you visit our sites, our servers automatically collect some information about your visit, including;

  * Type of User Agent (web browser) used to access the site 
  * Where you were refered from 
  * The page you initally entered the site on 
  * The page you ultimately exited the site from 
  * The time you initally accessed the site



However, no personal details like your name nor email address are collected by this automatic process. Nor is any information that could identify you (like an IP address) correlated with any of the above information.

**The giving of information to other companies**

Numerologist.com **DOES NOT** sell or disclose individually identifiable information obtained online about our visitors to anyone outside of Numerologist.com. The only exceptions to this rule are the following: 

  * It is required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site 
  * Disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees, or property 



**Accommodating links to other sites**

Numerologist.com's site may contains links to other Web sites. 

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. However, in some instances where a service is provided through a non-Numerologist.com partner or supplier site, such as Online Payments, you can feel confident that your individually identifiable information will be protected. Numerologist.com requires suppliers not to use the information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, protecting the privacy of your information. 

### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

## NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement.

**Providing information on registration forms** When you choose to register with Numerologist.com, we request accurate contact information and preferences that help us better serve you.
