# Privacy Policy

The No 10 website, with the exception of the registration system, does not store or capture personal information, but merely logs the user's IP address (Internet Protocol: standard allowing data to be transmitted between two devices) which is automatically recognised by the webserver.

The No 10 site uses cookies for collecting user information from the site and the No10 site does not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of the website.

This site is carrying banner advertising for government services. In order to avoid you seeing the same advertisements repeated over and over, and to allow us to gauge the number of people viewing a campaign or particular web page this site uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site, and contain a unique, anonymous number. They are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive, and do not expire at the end of your session.

If you register to receive updates your information will be held on a secure server and the data will not be shared with any organisations outside Government. It will be used only to provide you with e-mail updates on the topics you have requested or postal information if you request that service.
