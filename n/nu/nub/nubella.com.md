Poverty & Poor Dental Health 

Lower income and education levels are tied to poor dental health, according to a study based on data from more than 15,000 people living in North Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota and Maryland. Researchers found that the lower a person's income and education level, the more likely that person would suffer from severe periodontitis, or advanced gum disease that can lead to tooth loss.
