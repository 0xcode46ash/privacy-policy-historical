# NuVox :: Legal Notices :: Privacy Policy

NuVox is committed to your privacy. This Privacy Policy demonstrates our commitment to privacy and security, and informs you of the type of information we may gather about you, either as a visitor to NuVox’s website, or when you order NuVox services. This Privacy Policy also explains how NuVox may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and your ability to control the use of that information. NuVox’s privacy policy governs data collection and usage for all NuVox services. NuVox requests that you read this Policy carefully.

**CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION**  
“Customer Proprietary Network Information,” or “CPNI” is a broad term that encompasses two main categories of information which carriers like NuVox collect and use in order to conduct business and offer telephone and data services. First, CPNI includes, among other things, individually identifiable information indicating to whom, where, and when a customer places a call, as well as the types of service offerings to which a customer subscribes and how much any particular service is used. Second, “aggregate customer” information, is collective data that relates to a group or category of service or customers from which individual customer characteristics have been removed. ****

**COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR CPNI**  
Typically, companies like NuVox collect the data described above through the ordinary course of the customer-carrier relationship. When necessary, NuVox uses such information to fulfill orders, provide service, bill, and communicate with customers. We may also use such data to develop new products or services tailored to fit customers’ specific needs.

NuVox protects all CPNI in the control of NuVox, and treats such information in a manner consistent and in compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements.

**“Individually Identifiable” CPNI**  
NuVox will not sell, trade, or disclose to unaffiliated third parties any individually identifiable customer information without the consent of the customer. As used in this Privacy Policy, “unaffiliated third parties” do not include NuVox’s agents or affiliates that sell or provide communications-related services, its joint venture partners, or independent contractors. 

However, NuVox, its agents and affiliates that provide communications-related services, its joint venture partners or independent contractors may use, disclose, or permit unaffiliated third parties to access customers’ individually identifiable CPNI in order to (1) initiate, render, bill, and collect for telecommunications service; (2) protect NuVox’s rights or property, or to protect customers and other carriers from the fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such service; or (3) to provide any inbound telemarketing, referral, or administrative service to the customer for the duration of the call, if such call was initiated by the customer and the customer approves of the use of such information to provide such service. 

In instances where NuVox and a partner jointly promote service, NuVox may provide the partner with certain personal information (such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the service as a result of the joint promotion) for the exclusive purpose of implementing the promotion and allowing NuVox and its partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose.

**“Aggregate Customer” Information**  
NuVox also gathers a variety of aggregate customer information, including, but not limited to, the number and frequency of calls into our Customer Care Department and visits to NuVox’s website and its different pages. Web visits are monitored through the use of “cookies.” A cookie is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. NuVox may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and service we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks.As explained in more detail below, NuVox may share with unaffiliated third parties such aggregate information.

Non-NuVox websites may require you to accept cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**ONLINE SHOPPING**  
Though NuVox may provide Internet services to an unaffiliated third party from whom you then purchase services online, NuVox has no control over the unaffiliated third party’s use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order with the unaffiliated third party. Please exercise care when doing so.

**RESPONSES TO EMAIL INQUIRIES**  
When visitors or customers send email inquiries to NuVox, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. NuVox does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any unaffiliated third party.

**VOLUNTARY CUSTOMER SURVEYS**  
We may periodically conduct customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by an unaffiliated third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other NuVox customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-individually identifying information may be shared with unaffiliated third parties.

**NUVOX'S COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**  
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Websitescan be fun for our younger audience; however, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly websites and how to report online trouble, please visit [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/). Finally, NuVox recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to NuVox, or to anyone else online.

**PUBLIC FORUMS**  
Please remember that any information you may disclose in our Member Directory, or other public areas of our websites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.

**NUVOX'S COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY**  
Services and websites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this information.

**HOW TO MODIFY YOUR INFORMATION**  
NuVox customers can modify information provided during registration. To modify such information, contact our Customer Care Department at **800-600-5050.**

**YOUR RIGHTS**  
In accordance with federal law, customers have the right to restrict the use and/or disclosure of their individually identifiable CPNI. If you would like to restrict NuVox from using your individually identifiable CPNI to market communications-related service, call us at 877-331-7808. Your election will be valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit it. Please note that, while restricting NuVox’s use of CPNI will not affect the provision of any service to which you currently subscribe, NuVox will be restricted in its ability to offer you products and services tailored to meet your specific needs.

Customers also have the right to require NuVox to disclose their CPNI to any person or entity upon a written request.
