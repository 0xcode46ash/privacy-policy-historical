This website may also include services provided by third parties and distributed through the website by virtue of a license, grant, or some other form of agreement between the third party and The T. Colin Campbell Cneter for Nutrition Studies. In the policies that follow, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “TCCCNS” refers to The T. Colin Campbell Cneter for Nutrition Studies.  
TCCCNS provides this website under the following conditions. If you visit this website, you agree to accept our Privacy Policy and Terms Of Use. Please read them carefully.

TCCCNS recognizes the need to treat any personal information that you share with us with a high degree of care, sensitivity, and security. We appreciate your trust.  
This version of our Privacy Policy is effective as of November 1st, 2013.

## E-mail addresses you provide

If you supply us with your e-mail address, we will use it only to communicate with you regarding questions you have asked. If you are a subscriber to our Newsletter, you may also receive periodic e-mails from us with information, services, upcoming events, fundraising efforts, and special announcements.  
If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by unsubscribing using the tools provided (e.g., unsubscribing from our e-newsletter) or by contacting us. We will honor your request as quickly as possible.  
Regarding e-mails you send to us: Please be aware that e-mail is not a secure method of transmitting information; therefore, please do not disclose sensitive information by e-mail. As our website’s Terms Of Use indicates, tccCNS is not responsible for any loss or damage that results from interception and/or unauthorized use by third parties of any information that you send us by e-mail.

## Ad servers

We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad-server companies. While we have Google Analytics installed in our site, it is only for the purpose of measuring site statistics in the aggregate and never for the purpose of any form of advertising.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any personal information you provide to us.

tccCNS may release personal information as required by law — for example, to comply with a court order. In very limited circumstances, we also may release personal information if we believe in good faith that disclosing such information is necessary to protect the safety of our subscribers, our website visitors, this website, and/or the general public.

tccCNS is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. We have a combination of physical, electronic, and procedural measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information. Access to your personal information is limited to those who need it to perform their duties.  
Our commitment to security notwithstanding, please be aware that there is always some risk when transmitting personal information over the internet, and no method of storing electronic data is completely secure. A risk remains that others could find a way to thwart our security measures. Therefore, despite the fact that we strive to protect your personal information, tccCNS cannot and does not warrant or guarantee the security or privacy of any information you send to us. You do so at your own risk.

tccCNS maintains a general-audience website. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 and are particularly concerned about children’s privacy online. If you are under 13, please do not send us any of your personal information, and you may use this website only with the involvement and consent of a parent or guardian.

tccCNS is not responsible for the privacy policies, data-collection practices, contents, or terms of use of other websites to which we link. If you visit external websites, please review their privacy policies and terms of use.

The personal information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By submitting your personal information, you consent to its transfer and storage in the United States. You also consent to its use in accordance with the purposes for which it was collected and as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

In the future, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not outlined in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change, we will post the changes on our website and give you the choice to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is being used, please check our website periodically.  
Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by contacting us.

If you feel that our website is not following the Privacy Policy outlined above, please contact us. Alternatively, you can contact your state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau, state or local consumer protection office, or the Federal Trade Commission at 202-FTC-HELP (202-382-4357).
