# nutrisystem.com - Privacy Policy

At nutrisystem.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

  * When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. 
  * When you submit a customer review, we also ask for your e-mail address, although you can choose not to have your e-mail address displayed with your review. 
  * We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new nutrisystem.com services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. 
  * When you register for membership, nutrisystem.com collects basic health profile information. This is to ensure that nutrisytem’s products and services do not pose any risk to you prior to joining the plan. You will be notified at registration if your profile excludes you from participation in the plan. 
  * When you register we gather identifying information via “cookies”. Cookies are small pieces of digital information stored by your browser on your computer. Our cookies do not contain personal information, but they enable us to identify you as a repeat visitor, and help us to personalize your user experience. 

**How does nutrisystem.com protect customer information?**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**Will nutrisystem.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**  
nutrisystem.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to [never@nutrisystem.com](mailto:never@nutrisystem.com). (If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message from each e-mail account you use.) Also, nutrisystem.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

**Your Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by nutrisystem.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**Tell us what you think**  
nutrisystem.com welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please send e-mail to [feedback@nutrisystem.com](mailto:feedback@nutrisystem.com).
