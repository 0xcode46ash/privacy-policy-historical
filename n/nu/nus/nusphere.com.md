# Your Privacy and NuSphere

NuSphere and your privacy

At NuSphere we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to NuSphere.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of www.NuSphere.com, download free software, request new information, or subscribe to the NuSphere newsletter.

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on NuSphere.com (and related NuSphere sites) are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide NuSphere with your name (or alias), mailing address, or telephone number, NuSphere and NuSphere representatives may use your postal address and phone number to alert you to certain upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, and/or new services. ("Representatives" include value-added resellers and authorized training partners.)

When you provide NuSphere with your e-mail address (as an alternative to, or in addition to, your mailing address and phone number), NuSphere may contact you via e-mail. NuSphere never releases e-mail addresses to its Representatives. NuSphere also does not offer, or allow for the selling of, any user-provided information to third parties.

If you do not want NuSphere or NuSphere representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting NuSphere directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt [back] in and have NuSphere contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For detailed instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of NuSphere's Web sites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.

NuSphere membership

NuSphere offers free membership to all NuSphere.com visitors. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences. This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.

There is an additional "Remember Me" option that allows you to be recognized (by your user-designated name or alias) when returning to any NuSphere Web site in the future. Acceptance of this option allows NuSphere to place a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits. This eliminates the need to continually ask you for the same information. This cookie contains no personal information, with the exception of your name or alias that you previously provided.

No information, other than that found in the cookie, will be accessed by any NuSphere system. Access to your user information always requires both your Member ID and Password.

How NuSphere will protect your personal information

NuSphere will always protect the personal information that you share with us. NuSphere stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand, and will not use the number for marketing purposes.

If NuSphere requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.

NuSphere may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.
