Although user sessions are tracked, the users remain anonymous.
  3. If you choose to send an application or an e-mail that contains personally identifiable data, we may share relevant data within NUS, so as to serve you efficiently and effectively, unless such sharing is prohibited by legislation. 
  4. For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us or other NUS agencies.
