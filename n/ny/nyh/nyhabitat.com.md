**The BBBOnLine Reliability seal program** is the Better Business Bureau's system's reliability assurance program for the World Wide Web. Its mission is to help Web users find reliable, trustworthy businesses on-line and to help reliable businesses identify themselves as such, all via voluntary self-regulatory programs that help avoid government regulation of the Internet. 

New York Habitat is a member of the Better Business Bureau in good standing. Displaying the BBBOnLine Reliability seal on our site gives New York Habitat customers the assurance that will stand behind its service.
