**NYC.COM Privacy Policy**

As New York City's portal, our goal is to offer the best of the city in one convenient site while maintaining a total commitment to your privacy needs and expectations. Please read on for details about our privacy statement. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you sign up for our services, you must go through our registration process. This will ensure seamless integration of a wide variety of features and services, both present and planned. When registering we will ask you to provide, on a voluntary basis, personal information as well as some demographic data. Certain information we require you fill out, such as your first and last name, state and zip code (or country and postal code for non-U.S. residents), gender and date of birth. This information is important for us to provide you with quality services that are responsive to your needs. 

Rest assured that the information we receive from or about you is stored on systems specially designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. We also encrypt your transmission of any sensitive information to us (e.g., credit card numbers, account passwords, etc.). While we use industry standard security practices, be aware that no transmission or storage on the Internet is completely secure. 

Additionally, we take note of certain information sent by most Web browsers for demographic purposes only. We track how the information and services that we provide are used by recording site traffic patterns and by maintaining log files of users' access to site files. This information is used to identify demographic trends and to provide information tailored to our users. Additional system information we may gather includes the type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. 

We are always available for you 24/7 here at the online city that never sleeps and are interested in your comments, questions and concerns. E-mail us anytime at help@nyc.com; no request goes unanswered by your virtual nyc.com concierge! 

**Here are some frequently asked questions:**

**What about my kids who register at Newyorkcity.com?**  
We are especially committed to providing a safe and secure environment for younger users. We believe that children should get their parentsí consent before giving out personal information, and that the safest environment is one in which parents participate in a childís experience in cyberspace. We are currently developing a NYC Kids area of the site that will provide enriching, safe, and appropriate content for our younger users. While parental control and web filtering technology are two tools available to assist you in guiding your childís experience, a big city by nature has many offerings and experiences. As always, we encourage your input and suggestions in this realm. 

**What about links to external sites?**  
Newyorkcity.com is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Web sites to which it might link. Our goal is simply to offer the most complete directory of services and links to everything about New York City. 

**What about Spam?**  
Sending of Spam, or unsolicited email, is a clear violation of our user policies. Users who violate this policy will be subject to immediate termination of their e-mail accounts and/or possible legal action. Our e-mail has built in Safety filters that enable you to block unsolicited email (spamming).
