# Privacy Policy

| 

The Library is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its online users, customers, members, donors, and friends. We believe that maintaining privacy on the Web is very important, and that informing our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use it is crucial. 

**Type of Information Collected**  
The Library does not collect any "personally identifiable information" about individuals-such as names and postal or e-mail addresses-except when such information is voluntarily submitted by the user. Personally identifiable information might be obtained from online transactions such as purchases, registrations, or membership pledges. Additionally, personally identifiable information may be transmitted in connection with other activities, services, or resources made available on our site. 

In common with many Websites, the Library's Website automatically logs certain "non-personally identifiable" information about visits to our Website. This information is used for system administration and for producing usage statistics.

**How the Information Is Used**

Any personally identifiable information provided to the Library is maintained by and accessible only to the Library unless the Library explicitly states otherwise. The Library will not release information on the use of specific Internet or Website resources by members of the public except as required by law or necessary for the proper operation of the Library.

**Third-Party Partners**  
The Library has teamed up with reputable third-party vendors in order to provide certain services to its online users. In cases when users leave the Library's site to visit one of its partners' sites, users are encouraged to become familiar with the privacy statements of each site they visit.

**Security**  
The Library has all reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect online. We do not, however, claim any responsibility for information collected by or from Websites linking to or from the Library's Website.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a Website and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files that were created by other sites-the Website that creates a cookie is the only one that a browser will permit to access it.

Examples of ways in which the Library might use cookies would be to customize content areas or to analyze site activity and user behavior.

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, the Library suggests that you explore your browser's options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow cookies altogether. Users should be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies may restrict the user's access to certain types of content or features.

**Children**  
Parents should remind their children to ask their permission before providing personal information to any Website or purchasing any products or services online. The Library urges all parents to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet and to teach them about protecting their personal information while online. For further information, see [A Safety Net for the Internet: A Parent's Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20040824224525id_/http%3A//www.nypl.org/legal/safety.cfm).

Promotional E-mail, Newsletter, and List-Serve Policy and "Opt-In/Opt-Out" Elections If you give permission, the Library may use personally identifiable information you submit for promotional purposes. For example, on occasion the Library may wish to send e-mails to inform users of new exhibitions or other events we think might be of interest to them. You will not receive such communications unless you have willingly provided the personal information required. In some cases, you will be required to "opt-in" by joining a newsgroup or mailing list. If you do "opt-in," you will always have the option to "opt-out" at any time by "unsubscribing" to that particular list.

**Policy Changes**  
Changes may occasionally be made to this Website Privacy Policy as new services and content are added to the site or to reflect changes in the Library's policies. Visitors to the Library's Website are encouraged to check this document periodically to stay informed of current Library privacy guidelines.

**Acceptance of Terms**  
By using the Library's Website, you signify your acceptance of this Website Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of any Library site following the posting of changes to these terms will indicate your acceptance of those changes.
