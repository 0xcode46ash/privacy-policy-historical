# MCU: Resource Center - Security - Privacy Policy

At Municipal Credit Union (MCU) your privacy is important to us. This Online Privacy Policy is intended to explain how we treat information received from our MCU web site.

**General Information**

No Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"), such as your name or address, is collected automatically when you visit our web site. 

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, MCU utilizes software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Web site management information is collected for statistical purposes. Computer software programs are used to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

The following information is automatically collected and stored when you visit our web site:

  * The Internet domain (e.g., AOL, or MSN) from which you access our Web site
  * The make and model of Internet browser software that you have used when accessing our Web site; and
  * The number of times that you have visited our Web site during the current month (MCU utilizes "cookies". A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your visit. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested and decide whether or not to accept it.)



When viewing nymcu.org, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer. We work with our display advertising partner, Xaxis, to present you with retargeting advertising on other web sites based on your previous actions on nymcu.org. The methods our partners use adhere to the highest advertising privacy standards, do not collect PII, observe all opt-out requests from users, do not install any software programs whatsoever, and use only Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) certified technology. Click here to opt-out of Xaxis’ and their partners’ targeted advertising. If you choose to opt-out, your election will be communicated by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) to their participating companies and a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision to opt-out. If you elect to opt-out, bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and devices that have browsers, you will need to opt-out from each browser on each of the computers and devices that you use. You may still receive advertisements from us, they just won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities.

**Information Collected from E-mails and Web Forms**

When you send us PII, for example, in an electronic mail message containing a question or comment or by filling out a form that e-mails us information, we use this information to fulfill or respond to your requests. We may store these requests to provide us with information for future improvements to our Web site. We may forward your e-mail to third parties who provide specific products that you are requesting information about. We do not create individual profiles with this information you provide. MCU does not give, sell or transfer personal information to third parties unless: a) it is necessary for completing a transaction, or b) it is required to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, or c) it is required by law or, d) you give MCU your permission.
