For purposes of this policy, “personal information” means any information concerning a natural person which, because of name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person. _DTF does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this Web site unless you provide that information voluntarily; for example, by sending such information in an email or by providing it in connection with an online transaction._

None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal information.

The information that is collected automatically is used to improve this Web site's content and to help DTF understand how users are interacting with the Web site. This information is collected for statistical analysis, to determine what information is of most and least interest to our users, and to improve the utility of the material available on the Web site. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and DTF is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from the Web site for commercial marketing purposes.

Cookies

The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet Web sites. The DTF Web site uses cookies. Cookies are small files stored on your computer by your Web browser to provide a means of distinguishing among users of the Web site. The cookies DTF utilizes do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security.

The software and hardware you use to access the Web site allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this Web site.

Information Collected When You Send DTF an Email or Conduct an Online Transaction through this Web site

During your visit to this Web site you may send an email to DTF. Your email address and the contents of your message will be collected. Your email address and the information included in your message may be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this Web site, to forward your message to another State agency for appropriate action, and/or to communicate with you regarding general tax information and DTF services. Your email address is not collected for commercial purposes and DTF is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your email address for commercial purposes.

During your visit to this Web site you may conduct an online transaction. This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or utilizing any of DTF’s online services. The information, including personal information, provided by you in conducting the transaction is used by DTF to operate DTF programs, which include the provision of services and information. The information collected by DTF may, to the extent permitted by law, be disclosed by DTF for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted.

DTF does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this Web site. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in an email will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. DTF strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.

Information and Choice

As noted above, DTF does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this Web site unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an email or conducting an online transaction. This includes, for example, filling out an online survey or order form or utilizing any of DTF’s online services. As a general matter, you may choose not to send an email, not to fill out a survey or online order form and/or not to utilize DTF’s online services (some transactions may, however, be required by law to be conducted online, such as mandatory e-filing, through DTF's online services). While your choice not to participate may limit your ability to receive specific services through this Web site, it will not usually prevent you from requesting services from DTF by other means (e.g., by telephone or United States mail or similar delivery service) and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the Web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.

Disclosure of Information Collected Through this Web site

The collection of information through this Web site and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act. DTF will only collect personal information through this Web site or disclose personal information collected through this Web site if the user has consented to the collection or disclosure of such personal information. The voluntary disclosure of personal information to DTF by the user, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by DTF for the purposes for which the user disclosed the information to DTF, as was reasonably ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.

Further, the disclosure of information, including personal information, collected through this Web site is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Law, the Personal Privacy Protection Law and the Tax Law.

DTF may disclose personal information to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce DTF’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to DTF’s information technology assets.

Use of Email

DTF will regard provision of an email address by a site user, taxpayer or taxpayer representative (whether via electronic or paper submission), to constitute consent to communicate electronically. DTF may use the email address to communicate general information and/or notice of DTF services. DTF will never request that you provide sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, Taxpayer ID numbers, bank account numbers, PINs, user names, or passwords via email. An email from DTF will be general in nature and if sensitive personal information needs to be communicated, DTF will alert you to sign on to the secure Online Services area of the DTF website to access your secure account to receive or provide such information.
