# Privacy Policy | Next Gen Web Solutions

NGWeb Solutions wants you to understand how we collect, protect and use your personal information and the choices you have about how that information is used. This notice covers all of the information handling practices for the NGWeb Solutions companies listed at the end of this notice. However, certain departments and/or products within these companies may have more restrictive information handling practices.

#### Online information 

We at NGWeb Solutions are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, and to protecting your personal information during your visit. When you access a NGWeb Solutions Web site (NGWeb Solutions Site), you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all personally identifiable information we collect is held to the standards of this privacy policy. 

To access NGWeb Solutions products via the NGWeb Solutions Sites, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0or greater, MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet. 

If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear broken. Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock in an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select “Properties”. If the Web site address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” indicates a secure site or area of the site. 

When you enter a NGWeb Solutions Site, you will pass through our security “firewall” and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of you computer or handheld device, the IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.
