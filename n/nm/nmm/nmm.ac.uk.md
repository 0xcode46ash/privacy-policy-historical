# Privacy statement : National Maritime Museum

The National Maritime Museum respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Website. We operate in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. 

  
**Your information**  
Information about you may be collected when you visit our Website either by automatic tracking devices (see 'Tracking our visitors' below) or, more directly, where you request a specific service, such as subscribing to the newsletter or booking a ticket online (see below for more details).

You are most likely to submit personal information when you send us feedback or request a subscription (e.g. the Journal for Maritime Research). Similarly, if an individual requests information or orders products from the online shop a certain amount of information is required in order to fulfil the order. We only use this information to supply the services that have been requested and to monitor and improve the quality of our Website.

It is the Museum's policy not to distribute or sell your information on to any third party.

  
**Tracking our visitors**  
The Museum monitors how people use the Website and aggregates general statistics about customers, traffic patterns and related site information in an anonymous form. In order to collect this data the Museum uses software on the Website that collects statistics from IP data. This software can determine what times of day people access our site, which country they access the Website from, how long they visit the site for, what browser they are using etc.

This information is collected primarily to measure the popularity of the site as a whole and particular content, allowing us to judge visitor needs and tailor future content.

  
**Cookies**   
In some areas of our site, a cookie may be placed on your computer. A cookie is a small file that resides on your computer's hard drive that allows the Museum to improve the quality of your visit to our Website. If your browser permits it you can set your computer to reject cookies, although this may affect the quality of your visit. 

Collections online, PortCities and Maritime Art Greenwich require cookies to be enabled to allow you to perform some searches and login and create your own collections. The Flash version of the Hodges website also requires cookies to work correctly.

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, we suggest you set your browser's privacy settings to 'high'. This setting will block cookies that collect personal information without your explicit consent while allowing you to fully enjoy the features of the Website.

  
**Newsletter**  
The Museum has entered into a partnership with Patron Technology to assist us in providing an e-mail newsletter service. In order to sign up to this service, an individual has to submit personal information about themselves (e.g. name, e-mail address, interests).

This personal data is collected by Patron Technology on behalf of the Museum. They have entered into an agreement with the Museum to hold all details in a secure way. They are not permitted to use the data for their own purposes nor to sell or distribute it on to any other individual, organization or business under any circumstances.

If, for whatever reason, our agreement with Patron Technology ends, they are contractually obliged to hand back the data to the National Maritime Museum and to delete all of the Museum's personal data from their computers.

You can 'opt out' of the newsletter at any time by clicking on the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of each newsletter. Alternatively you can e-mail the Web Editor via the '[Contact us](http://www.nmm.ac.uk/site/navId/00500b)' section of the Website. Your details will then be deleted from the database.
