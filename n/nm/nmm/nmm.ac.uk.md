### Introduction

The National Maritime Museum respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. We operate in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. 

### Your information

Information about you may be collected when you visit our websites either by automatic tracking devices (see 'Tracking our visitors' below) or, more directly, where you request a specific service, such as subscribing to the newsletter or booking a ticket online (see below for more details).

You are most likely to submit personal information when you send us feedback or request a subscription – for example with the [Journal for Maritime Research](http://www.jmr.rmg.co.uk/). Similarly, if an individual requests information or orders products from the online shop a certain amount of information is required to fulfil the order. We only use this information to supply the services that have been requested and to monitor and improve the quality of our websites.

It is the Museum's policy not to distribute or sell your information on to any third party.

### Tracking our visitors

The Museum monitors how people use our websites and aggregates general statistics about customers, traffic patterns and related site information in an anonymous form. In order to collect this data, the Museum uses software that collects statistics from IP data. This software can determine what times of day people access our site, which country they access the websites from, how long they visit for, what browser they are using, etc.

This information is collected primarily to measure the popularity of the websites as a whole and particular content, allowing us to judge visitor needs and tailor future content.

### Cookies

This website uses cookies. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer by a website. Cookies allow the Museum to improve the quality of your visit to our websites. If your browser permits it you can set your computer to reject cookies, although this may affect the quality of your visit.

This website uses the following cookies:

  * PHPSESSID – used to maintain 'state' between requests, so that the website can re-identify you as the same user
  * X-Mapping-fjhppofk – used for load-balancing across our web servers in order to maximise website speed and performance
  * AMAXHOST– used by our web content management system to detect which server the site is running on
  * cookie_accept – to let us know that you have seen the message about our use of cookies and have opted to continue using the site on this basis
  * __utma,  __utmb, __utmc and __utmz – [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) cookies which track things like the number of times a visitor has been to the site, date/time of first and most recent visits, length of visit, search engine and keyword used etc.



The [Collections Online](http://www.rmg.co.uk/collections) and [PortCities](http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/) websites also use cookies to enable you to perform certain searches, to login, and to create your own collections. 

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, we suggest you set your browser's privacy settings to 'high'. This setting will block cookies that collect personal information without your explicit consent while allowing you to fully enjoy the features of the websites. Depending on your web browser, you may also be able to block or delete specific cookies using browser tools or settings.

### Content updates by email

The Museum uses [Google FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home) to send a daily digest of new content from our website. If an individual want to use this service, they have to submit a valid email address. Individuals who don’t want to share this personal information can still access our new content by visiting the website. Google FeedBurner’s [privacy policy](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/privacy) states that they will only use the email address for the purpose for which it was collected, that is, delivery of email content updates from websites selected by the individual. Individuals can unsubscribe at any time by following the ‘unsubscribe’ link that is included in every email. Individuals can change and modify information previously provided, or permanently and irrevocably delete their Google FeedBurner account, at any time.

### Newsletter

The Museum uses [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) to provide our [e-mail newsletter service](http://www.rmg.co.uk/newsletter). In order to sign up to this service, an individual has to submit personal information about themselves (e.g. name, e-mail address, interests).

This personal data is collected by MailChimp on behalf of the Museum. The data is stored on a secure MailChimp server. MailChimp are not permitted to use the data for their own purposes nor to sell or distribute it on to any other individual, organization or business under any circumstances. 

You can 'opt out' of the newsletter at any time by clicking on the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of each newsletter. Alternatively you can contact us via the '[Contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20141227083150id_/http%3A//www.nmm.ac.uk/server.php?show=nav.00500b)' section of the main website. Your details will then be deleted from the database.

### Online donations

We have enabled online donations to be made to the Museum through Justgiving. They operate a strict privacy policy and will never pass your personal details on to anyone, including the Museum, without your express consent. Find out more on the [Justgiving website](http://www.justgiving.com/).

### Booking tickets online

Our online booking service is provided by Syx ReCreateX. They collect personal information on behalf of the Museum to process each transaction and only use personal data where it is necessary to fulfil your order. Syx do not disclose personal data to other parties.

### Facebook 'Likes'

The NMM Website uses the Facebook ‘Like’ button on all our events pages (e.g. [planetarium shows](http://www.rmg.co.uk/visit/events/planetarium/sky-tonight)), and on certain other pages e.g. [Astronomy Photographer of the Year](http://www.rmg.co.uk/visit/exhibitions/astronomy-photographer-of-the-year/).

Facebook receives data whenever you visit a page that features a ‘Like’ button. This data may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address (URL) you're on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Facebook, your User ID. 

Facebook keeps this data for 90 days. After that, Facebook removes your name or any other personally identifying information from the data, or combines it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
