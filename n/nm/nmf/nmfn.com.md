The Northwestern Mutual Financial Network will not release any of said information about you without your permission, unless permitted or required by law.  
  
What Information The Northwestern Mutual Financial Network Collects   
  
The Northwestern Mutual Financial Network gathers two types of information about people who visit our site: data you provide through optional, voluntary contact request forms; and aggregated tracking information such as IP address and home server information.  
  
Financial Representative or Recruiter Contact Request Forms  
  
When you would like to have a Northwestern Mutual Financial Network Representative or a Northwestern Mutual Financial Network recruiter contact you, we will ask you for:

\- your name

\- your street address

\- your phone number

\- your email address

Since life insurance is primarily state-regulated, and our Financial Representatives are licensed by state, we need your street address so that we may forward your information to the agency nearest you. Your name, phone number and/or email address enable you to be contacted, per your request.

This information is routed to our Financial Representatives via a third-party marketing firm, which is under contract to maintain this information in confidence. The Northwestern Mutual Financial Network does not share this information with any other party.  
  
Customer Service Request Forms  
  
We want to provide our customers with a means to communicate with us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We do this through our Customer Service email forms.

In order to provide you with the service you need the most efficient way possible, we will ask you for:

\- your name

\- your social security number

\- your street address

\- your policy/annuity/IRA number

\- your Insurance Service Account number (if applicable)

\- your phone number

\- your email address

This information is for our internal use to service your request, so that we may access your customer information. It is not shared with any third party, unless permitted or required by law.  
  
"Longevity Game"; Interactive Forms or Calculators  
  
Any other interactive forms or calculators on this Web site, including the Longevity Game, are there for your information only. Northwestern Mutual does not track, retain or use any of the data input into these forms, nor is the data in any way linked to you as an individual.  
  
Aggregated Tracking Information  
  
To enable us to continually improve on the content we offer our users, as well as for systems administration purposes, we collect aggregate information site-wide. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.
