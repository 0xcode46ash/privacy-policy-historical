# Web Site Privacy Statement | University Marketing and Communications at NMU

Thank you for visiting the Northern Michigan University Web site. Your privacy is very important to us. Our privacy policy is clear: We collect no personal identifying information about you when you visit our Web site unless you explicitly choose to make such information available.

                    If you do nothing during your visit but browse through our Web site, we will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  1. The Internet domain from which you are accessing the Web (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain).
  2. The IP address assigned to your computer. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access a network or the Internet.
  3. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.
  4. The date and time you access our site.
  5. The pages you access during your visit.
  6. The address of the Web site from which you linked to ours, if that is how you accessed the NMU Web site.



We aggregate this information into reports that help us make our site more usable, inform us about what areas of our site are most popular, and teach us about the technology being used by our site’s visitors. This information is not shared with other organizations.

We make use of "cookies," which are small data files stored on your computer in connection with your use of our Web site.  We use cookies to store temporary individual-user information concerning your use of this site.  We may also use information gathered by cookies to measure traffic patterns on our Web site or for similar purposes.  A user does not need to have the cookie function of their browser enabled in order to use the NMU Web site.  If you use a link from our site to another, or if you arrived at our site through a link from another site, it is possible that these other sites may place a cookie or other identifier on your computer.  We do not control and are not responsible for the use of cookies or other identifiers by any of these third parties.

If you choose to share personal identifying information with us—by sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information—we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Michigan’s archiving policies, but we will not disclose the information to third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law or other legal process.

If you want to see the personal identifying information we have collected about you from this site or if you believe any information we have is incorrect and you wish to correct it, please contact us at the e-mail address or phone number provided below.  If we change or delete information in response to your request, we will cease to use it; however, some residual information may remain in backup records or records of deletions.

Any communication or material other than your personal identifying information submitted to this Web site, such as questions, comment, suggestions and ideas, become the exclusive property of Northern Michigan University and may be used for any purpose whatsoever without restriction or compensation.

Northern Michigan University collects data about your activities that does not personally or directly identify you when you visit our website through the Google AdWords remarketing service. This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the amount of time you spend interacting with this content, your location information associated with your IP address, or your demographic information. We use the information we collect to serve you relevant advertisements throughout the Google display network and collect data about where you saw the ads and what ads you clicked on. NMU will not sell or distribute personal data collected from site visitors with any third-party vendors. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the [Google Advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/settings/ads). 

Children under the age of 13 should not send any information about themselves to us, including information like your name, address or e-mail address.  This Web site does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13.  In the event that we learn that we have collected such information from a child under 13 without parental consent, the information will be deleted from our database as soon as reasonably possible.

As our university grows and changes, and as technology and Internet use and practices change, Northern Michigan University may, from time to time, determine that changes in its policies, potentially including this privacy statement, are prudent.  If any such changes are made, they will be posted on this Web site.  Therefore you should review this Web site’s privacy statement and other policies posted on this site for potential changes when you return to the site for future visits.

If you have other questions or comments about our privacy policies, please feel free contact us at [edesign@nmu.edu](mailto:edesign@nmu.edu) or 906-227-2720.  Changes to NMU’s Web Privacy Policy will be noted on this page along with the date of implementation, so concerned site users should check this page periodically.  Northern Michigan University intends to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
