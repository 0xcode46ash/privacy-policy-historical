At New England Biolabs, Inc. (NEB), we take your privacy seriously. In general, when you visit NEB on the Web at [www.neb.com](https://web.archive.org/), you can choose how you interact with the website and how much information you share. Visitors can refuse to supply personal- information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain website-related activities.

New England Biolabs provides this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

## What We Collect

Within the NEB Website (“neb.com”), you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive a variety of materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages include your full name, contact details and billing information (including shipping address and end-user), transaction, and credit card information.

In order to tailor our communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your scientific areas of interest, experience with our products, contact preferences, and other information that helps us serve you.

## How We Use It

New England Biolabs uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate with you, to update you on services and benefits, and to personalize neb.com for you.

## With Whom We Share Your Personal Information

In general, we provide access to your personal information only to agents, vendors or service providers, who help us to provide products or services to you, or otherwise perform functions on our behalf. We will not sell or otherwise transfer your data to a third party for monetary consideration.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information to non-affiliated third parties in limited circumstances, where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of our customers, the public, or New England Biolabs. 

If we sell or transfer a business unit (such as a subsidiary or division) or an asset (such as a product line) to another company, we may share your personal information with such company under those circumstances.

In addition, we may disclose information about you to a non-affiliated third party at your request or if you consent in writing to the disclosure.

## Cookies and Other Tools

Like many websites, New England Biolabs uses cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”) to improve your neb.com experience. A cookie is a file containing text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. With cookies in place, our system will recognize you whenever you use your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) to connect to our page. This enables us to present you with custom web pages and otherwise improve your user experience.

If you choose not to take advantage of these interactive features, you can set up your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie has been sent. The Help section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage or delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they don’t track the user. Standard Do Not Track technology is not yet finalized, and not all browsers support DNT, so neb.com information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that it provides to consumers, may continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a DNT signal is received. For more information about DNT see <http://donottrack.us/>.

## Transfer of Data to Other Countries

Any information you provide to New England Biolabs may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States and other countries, which may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal information as the one in which you reside. However, New England Biolabs will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless of where your personal information is stored.

## Security

We use administrative, physical and technical measures to safeguard your personal information and help protect it from unauthorized access. However, no security can be 100% effective, so we cannot guarantee the security of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us at the email address listed below.

New England Biolabs uses both passwords and usernames to authenticate users (i.e. to verify the identity of each registered user). Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may update and timely post revisions to this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If the Privacy Policy changes in a way that materially affects how we handle personal information, we will not use the personal information we previously gathered in the manner described in the new policy without providing notice and/or obtaining your consent, as appropriate. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

If you have any questions or concerns about his policy, please contact NEB via email at [info@neb.com](mailto:info@neb.com).

Effective Date: October 1, 2013
