# Nextgov - NextGov.com Privacy Policy

At Nextgov, we want you to enjoy and benefit from Nextgov content with the comfort and knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. The following explains what information we collect about you and how we use it.

What We Learn  
This site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the site you passed through to reach Nextgov.com. In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to Nextgov.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program. Information you provide to us, such as your name, organization, address, telephone number and e-mail address, are only collected when you complete a request for a subscription to a Nextgov.com or Government Executive product or service.

How We Use What We Learn  
The information we collect is used to improve the content of Nextgov and to help develop new products. Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers and new Nextgov.com or GovernmentExecutive.com products that may be of interest to you.

What We Tell Others About You  
We do not furnish the information that we automatically gather about you to third parties, unless we are legally required to do so. We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate - never information about you personally - to our partners about how visitors use Nextgov.com.
